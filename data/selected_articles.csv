"© 2021, The Author(s). Knowledge of the interactions between soil systems, management practices, and climatic extremes are critical for prescription-based sustainable practices that reduce environmental pollution/footprints, disruption of food supply chains, food contamination, and thus improve socio-economic wellbeing. Soil quality status and dynamics under climate change present both a hazard which may not be remedied by simply adding chemicals or improved by crop varieties, and an opportunity (e.g., by indicating impact of a shift in land use) although the specifics remain debatable. This entry not only revisits the science of soil quality determination but also explicates on intricacies of monitoring using big data generated continuously and integrated using the “internet of things.” Indeed, relaying credible soil quality information especially for heterogeneous soils at field scale is constrained by challenges ranging from data artifacts and acquisition timing differences, vague baselines, validation challenges, scarcity of robust standard algorithms, and decision support tools. With the advent of digital technology, modern communication networks, and advancement in variable rate technologies (VRT), a new era has dawned for developing automated scalable and synthesized soil quality metrics. However, before digital technology becomes the routine tool for soil quality sensing and monitoring, there is need to understand the issues and concerns. This contribution not only exemplifies a unique application of digital technology to detect residue cover but also deliberates on the following questions: (1) is digital agriculture the missing link for integrating, understanding the interconnectivity, and ascertaining the provenance between soil quality, agronomic production, environmental health, and climate dynamics? and (2) what are the technological gaps?[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",Digital technology dilemma: on unlocking the soil quality index conundrum,Accuracy *** Digital mapping *** Soil quality *** Spatial interpolation,bioresources and bioprocessing,85099049589,2021,0,,,,,
"© 1993-2012 IEEE. Counterfeit integrated circuits (ICs) have become a significant security concern in the semiconductor industry as a result of the increasingly complex and distributed nature of the supply chain. These counterfeit chips may result in performance degradation, profit reduction, and reputation risk for the manufacturer. Therefore, developing effective countermeasures against such malpractices is becoming severely crucial. Physical unclonable function (PUF)-based authentication methods have the potential to mitigate these challenges. However, PUF-based solutions are restrained by several factors, such as additional design efforts and significant area/power overhead, struggle to maintain and update challenge-response pairs (CRPs) database, and the vulnerability to machine learning (ML) attacks. In this article, we address these challenges by developing a novel database-free and enrolment-free hardware authentication approaches, i.e., a digital watermark metric for ICs. To enable efficient database-free hardware integrity verification without enrolment, first, we transform the intrinsic variations in circuit parameters, e.g., boundary scan chain (BSC) path delays in the joint test action group (JTAG) chain into robust digital signatures. Then, we perform statistical analysis on a small pilot unit of authentic chips to create a robust watermark for a complete batch of chips, which jointly captures the characteristics of the physical layout, the manufacturing process, and the foundry. The increasing complexity in the current state-of-the-art designs makes it extremely hard for an adversary to perfectly clone such statistical characterization of circuit parameters using counterfeit or compromised hardware. Besides, the proposed approach requires no additional design or hardware overhead in IC design since it utilizes an embedded structure, which inherently exists within the chips. It also obviates the design house from characterizing each manufactured chip instance, reducing overall testing cost. A path-delay measurement method at a high resolution based on clock phase sweep is introduced to measure the delay values effectively. The proposed intrinsic identifier-based authentication approach is validated by performing emulation on FPGAs and also by conducting physical measurements on custom-made printed circuit boards (PCBs). The reliability of the generated watermarks is evaluated with environmental temperature fluctuations and the aging effect.",On Database-Free Authentication of Microelectronic Components,Database-free *** emulation *** enrolment-free *** experimental *** joint test action group (JTAG) *** principal component analysis (PCA) *** runtime authentication *** watermark,ieee transactions on very large scale integration (vlsi) systems,85097936573,2021,0,,,,,
"The present study aimed to identify the most important achievement in the area of the supply chain (SC) during the past two decades using meta-methodology, co-word analysis, as well as systematic review and in-depth analysis. The results indicated the sustainability and resilience of SC are hot topics. Therefore, the need for qualitative and longitudinal studies and the use of methods such as ethnography or historical analysis are understood well in this respect. The current study had a holistic approach to SC, and thus simultaneously covered the relevant areas and provided an appropriate strategy for identifying the missing circles in the SC field using the meta-study and scientometric instruments. In general, the present study identified the research gaps in this field, and other studies can use them as a guideline in order to choose future research areas.",The investigation of research trends in supply chain management: an integrated method of meta-methodology and co-word analysis,Supply chain management *** meta-methodology *** co-word analysis,international journal of construction management,WOS:000560750500001,2021,0,,,,,
"In this paper, a mixed-integer linear programming model is discussed to provide joint decision making for facility location and production-distribution across countries for both forward and reverse logistics. A hybrid facility network is considered for cost-cutting and equipment sharing where the facilities of forward logistics are also equipped to provide reverse logistics services. The model considers the dynamic production and storage capacity of the facilities which can be expanded if required. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the model is tested to deal with disruptions due to man-made or natural disasters. The dynamic facility allocation enables the model to withstand the demand/supply disruptions in a disaster-affected zone. Besides this, the model considers carbon emissions caused due to manufacturing, remanufacturing, repair, storage and transportation. These emissions are regulated using cap and trade policy Thus, the proposed model balances resilience and sustainability under uncertain market demand and product returns. The chance-constrained approach is used to obtain the deterministic equivalence of the stochastic demand and returns. The paper also investigates the changes in emission and production level in each country under demand and supply disruptions. The parameters of the model are mapped with the various dimensions of big data such as volume, velocity and variety. The proposed model is solved using randomly generated data sets having realistic parameters with essential big data characteristics.",A stochastic disaster-resilient and sustainable reverse logistics model in big data environment,Reverse logistics *** Mixed-integer linear program (MILP) *** Uncertain demand and returns *** Carbon cap and trade *** Resilience,annals of operations research,WOS:000564403300002,2021,1,1,,,,
"With the process of economic globalisation, especially the Belt and Road Initiative implemented by China, the transnational supply chain is dramatically increasing, and the risk ripple effect is becoming increasingly important. Understanding and predicting the dynamic trend of risk transmission within the transnational supply chain is important to prevent the spread of risks. However, the current research lacks the dynamic interpretation of risk transmission and control in the transnational supply chain and ignores the impact of differences among suppliers and the network structure. Therefore, this paper proposed an improved susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model combined with a complex network model and an optimised approach to the selection of risk control strategies to explore three issues: first, the dynamic change and trend of risk transmission; second, the relationships and impacts of different suppliers and structure of the supply chain on risk transmission; and third, the selection of a risk control strategy within the transnational supply chain. A numerical analysis and an example of a risk control strategy selection are conducted to reveal four properties of risk transmission within the transnational supply chain. In addition, the model is verified with a simulation of a real-world scenario based on the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami.",Modelling of risk transmission and control strategy in the transnational supply chain,Risk management *** global supply chain *** complexity analysis *** SIS model *** complex network model,international journal of production research,WOS:000501694000001,2021,1,,,,,

"© 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers Beneficial to the environment but complex in nature, closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) has been understandably a topic of studies for a lot of researchers. However, most of the literature focuses on the homogeneity of CLSC products and on the dyadic structure of the CLSC mostly involving single manufacturers, distributors, or retailers. Very seldom do we find studies conducted in the analysis of the CLSC with network structure, in which multiple agents compete and coordinate. Inspired by some recent business cases, we develop a coupled CLSC network model dealing with heterogeneous products facing different market demands. The end-of-life product from the forward supply chain is collected and recycled so that raw material can be extracted and used as an input for the reverse supply chain which produces another type of product. Moreover, in each supply chain, raw material suppliers, manufactures, and retailers have to compete and coordinate to satisfy the demand while the forward and reverse supply chains have to work together to materialize the supply chain “loop”. Additionally, a CLSC network equilibrium is defined and studied by using variational inequalities. The properties of the equilibrium solution are also examined. By applying the modified projection method, we analyze a series of numerical examples. Based on the proposed model, the managerial insights are provided to show how the market size of the forward chain, raw material costs in both forward chain and reverse chain impact the demand, equilibrium prices and total profits of the CLSC network. It is also worth noting that the consumers' environmental awareness is critical to make the coupled CLSC networks viable.",Closed-loop supply chain network with interaction of forward and reverse logistics,Closed-loop supply chain *** Heterogeneous demand *** Network equilibrium *** Network interaction *** Variational inequality,sustainable production and consumption,85100463336,2021,1,,,,,
"Sustainable supply chain management plays an important role in company's sustainability success. As the frequently emerging disruptions may harm supply chain's sustainable performance, managers need to design an effective sustainable supply chain (SSC) resilience solution to mitigate different risks. In addition, it is critical to integrate customer requirements (CRs) in SSC resilience solution design as SSC's performance is highly determined by customer satisfaction (CS) in the customer-oriented market. This article proposes an integrative approach to achieve an effective design of SSC resilience solution, taking both CRs and risk factors (RFs) into consideration. In this study, the Kano model, decision-making and trial evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) are integrated with quality function deployment (QFD) through nonlinear programming to guide companies' design. Kano model is employed to analyse CRs qualitatively and quantitatively to determine each CR's priority and CS. DEMATEL is adopted to determine the RFs' interrelationships. The results obtained with the Kano model and DEMATEL are incorporated into QFD to transform CRs into RFs, and then into resilience measures. Furthermore, a nonlinear optimisation model is formulated to achieve the optimal resilience solution with maximised CS and risk mitigation under minimum cost investment. Finally, a case study is conducted to verify the methodology.",A novel Kano-QFD-DEMATEL approach to optimise the risk resilience solution for sustainable supply chain,sustainable supply chain *** risk *** resilience *** Kano *** quality function deployment *** DEMATEL,international journal of production research,WOS:000513974000001,2021,1,1,,,,
"© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) and the associated economic lockdown provided a jolt to businesses around the world and the global economy. Amid the ongoing uncertainty, circumstances varied across business sectors and regions, but the common goal for business organizations was to respond effectively, devising strategies to survive the turmoil and accelerate recovery. The narrative in India was no different from the rest of the world. Due to the novelty of the event, literature regarding its impact on the strategic management of firms was scarce. Thus, this paper aims to attempt to ascertain the crisis impact on firms and subsequently unravel the tactical short-term and long-term strategic responses initiated by Indian firms. Design/methodology/approach: The authors carried out an empirical investigation to comprehend the strategic foresight adopted by Indian firms. Following a structured literature review, the authors conducted semi-structured open-ended interviews with 28 business experts who were involved in drafting strategic responses for their respective firms. Subsequently, the authors performed a thematic content analysis of the expert interview responses to document firm-level strategic responses to the COVID-19 crisis and associated economic lockdown. The authors further searched reputed media articles to supplement and triangulate the primary research findings with management perspectives. Findings: The authors identified that managers had adopted a dual approach responding to the disruption. Companies simultaneously focused on surviving the crisis in the short-term by reconfiguring existing resources and initiated long-term recovery by mobilizing efforts for a redesigned business model. The research findings indicated that companies had adapted to the dynamic chaotic crisis environment to fulfill the changed consumer expectations. Remote working was widely implemented, supply networks were adjusted, operations were managed with minimal resources, working capital was closely monitored and the product-portfolio was revamped to reap benefits in an essentials-only world. The impact of several strategic firm responses was determined through this study on the revenue, profitability, operational costs and regulatory adherence of the companies along with the ability to meet stakeholder expectations. The study suggested that companies encouraged innovative solutions and highlighted the importance of collaborative inter-organizational practices. Research limitations/implications: The study contributed to an inter-theoretical perspective on firm strategic initiatives to confront a global crisis. Resource-based view, dynamic capabilities perspective and industrial-organizational theory-based perspectives, were applied. This facilitated an extensive analysis of the entire business ecosystem to identify various paths to accelerated recovery during and post COVID-19 world. Practical implications: The research findings would aid managers in drafting a comprehensive response strategy during and post COVID-19 world. This study results would help managers in addressing multiple concerns such as the sustainability of operations in the short-term through working capital management, the fulfillment of changing consumer needs through sustained innovation and business model alterations to ensure long term growth. The study enabled managers to prioritize necessary actions, ascertain the impact of strategic initiatives and build sustainable competitive advantage for long-term growth. Originality/value: The novel coronavirus pandemic and the associated economic lockdown impacted firm strategies and this was one of the very first empirical studies regarding how firm-level short-term tactics and long-term strategies were getting reshaped. Traditionally, companies were prepared to handle localized disruptions but a crisis of such epic global proportions jeopardized most business. This study provided an extensive review of the short-term tactical and long-term strategic response perspectives adopted by Indian firms to absorb the impact of this unique crisis and expected recovery with renewed strength. This was one of the first research articles to provide an inter-theoretical perspective on the ongoing global pandemic. This integrated view of the possible impacts of firm-level strategic initiatives provided a detailed knowledge repository to design the crisis response capability of firms.",Coronavirus pandemic and economic lockdown; study of strategic initiatives and tactical responses of firms,Business continuity *** Economic lockdown *** Organizational tactics *** Pandemic crisis *** Strategic initiatives,international journal of organizational analysis,85099419477,2021,1,,,,,
"© 2020 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies Online and omnichannel retail developments placed logistics at the front-end of consumers’ purchase journeys. Particularly the last mile of the supply chain increasingly affects consumer satisfaction, while its financial and environmental impact is critical. “Crowd logistics” is introduced as a promising solution. As consumers are increasingly driving innovation and initiatives in the last mile, it is important to know their preferences and perceptions. Our objective is to identify which type of consumer is interested in a crowdsourced last mile and which particular crowd logistics services are considered interesting. To this end, we set up a survey among a sample of one-thousand consumers that represent the Belgian population. The survey is analysed using descriptive statistics and two-step cluster analysis. Analysis shows that consumers support neighbour relays and delivery by retailers’ employees, but general interest is low. A cluster analysis identifies four attitudinal profiles. One segment, labelled the “trailblazers”, are most likely to adopt crowdsourced last mile services: they strongly prefer delivery at home and rely on their community of neighbours when a delivery fails. They are more interested in last mile innovations and sustainability enhancements. The research contributes by taking a consumer perspective on the last mile and by including three types of services and four types of crowd. Three recommendations for retailers are formulated, to focus on a crowdsourcing solution that combines collection and delivery among their employees’ local network, to target consumers that fit the identified profile and to accentuate crowd logistics’ quality of enhancing information transparency.",Who is interested in a crowdsourced last mile?

"CCBY The intake of the perishable fruits and vegetables (FVs) in the human diet can contribute to reduce the risk of some chronic diseases. But unfortunately, FVs loss rate is high among all the food produced annually and occurs at storage stage of post-harvest life cycle. One of the key factors contributing to this high loss rate is inability to gauge vital ambient environmental parameters in cold storage. The existing monitoring solutions about cold storage are limited to only gauge temperature, relative humidity and ignore other vital ambient environmental parameters such as luminosity and concentration of gases. This is a critical issue that needs to be addressed to overcome the loss rate of FVs. This paper presents a real-time intelligent monitoring and notification system (RT-IMNS) banked on an Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled approach for real-time monitoring of temperature, relative humidity, luminosity and concentration of gas in cold storage and notifies the personnel on exceeding of dangerous limits of these parameters. Moreover, decision support is implemented in the RT-IMNS using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with forward propagation to classify the status of commodity into one of three classes i.e. good, unsatisfactory or alarming. The proposed prediction model outperforms Compress Sending (CS), Adaptive Na&#x00EF;ve Bayes (ANB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Data Mining (DM) with respect to forecasting accuracy. We achieved 99% accuracy using forward propagation neural network model while existing models such as CS, ANB, XGBoost, DM achieved 95.60%, 87.50%, 93.59%, 90% accuracy respectively. Moreover, proposed approach achieved 100% precision, 100% recall, 100% F1-score for good class is achieved, for unsatisfactory class precision is 98%, recall is 99%, F1-score is 98% and for alarming class precision is 100%, recall is 98% and F1-score is 99%.",An IoT-based Real-time Intelligent Monitoring and Notification System of Cold Storage,ANN *** cold storage *** FVs *** Humidity *** IoT *** Monitoring *** Personnel *** Real-time systems *** Supply chains *** Temperature measurement *** Temperature sensors,ieee access,85100827557,2021,0,,,,,
"© 2021, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya. All rights reserved. Purpose: Managing the inventory of spare parts is very difficult because of the stochastic nature of part’s demand. Also, only controlling the inventory of the spare part is not enough; instead, the supply chain of the spare part needs to be managed efficiently. Moreover, every organization now aims to have a resilient and sustainable supply chain to overcome the risk of facility disruption and to ensure environmental sustainability. This paper thus aims to establish a model of inventory-location relating to the resilient supply chain network of spare parts. Design/methodology/approach: First, applying queuing theory, a location-inventory model for a spare parts supply chain facing a facility disruption risk and has a restriction for CO2 emission, is developed. The model is later formulated as a non-linear mixed-integer programming problem and is solved using MATLAB. Findings: The model gives optimal decisions about the location of the warehouse facility and the policy of inventory management of each location selected. The sensitivity analysis shows that the very low probability of facility disruption does not influence controlling the average emission level. However, the average emission level certainly decreases with the increment of the disruption probability when the facility disruption probability is significant. Practical implications: Using this model, based on the cost and emission parameters and the likelihood of facility disruption, the spare part’s manufacturer can optimize the total average cost of the spare part’s supply chain through making a trade-off between productions, warehouse selection, inventory warehousing and demand allocation. Originality/value: Previous research focuses only on developing a framework for designing an efficient spare parts planning and control system. The inventory-location model for spare parts is not addressed in the sense of risk of facilities disturbance and emission. This research first time jointly considered the probabilistic facility disruption risk and carbon emission for modeling the spare part’s supply chain network.",An integrated location-inventory model for a spare part’s supply chain considering facility disruption risk and co<inf>2</inf> emission,CO  emission 2 *** Facility disruption probability *** Location-inventory problem *** Queuing theory *** Spare part’s supply chain network,journal of industrial engineering and management,85101160639,2021,1,,,,,
"© 2013 IEEE. If the product supply shortage during the sales period, customers will turn to other company, so the enterprise will shortage the sales opportunity.

"© 2021 Taylor  &  Francis. Halal food supply chains (HFSCs) are increasingly characterized by fragmentation, complexity, and uncertainty. Halal food consumers are becoming more demanding for food quality and compliance with Islamic dietary law. As sustainability is a multidimensional concept that entails several aspects and interpretations, the objectives of HFSCs significantly overlap with the sustainable dimensions of the food ecosystem. The purpose of this study is to examine the inherent sustainable aspects and characteristics of HFSCs. Therefore, a systematic literature review and a bibliometric analysis were conducted to redress the lack of academic attention being given to the relationships of HFSCs with sustainability. Selected 74 papers were coded and analyzed according to the dimensions of sustainability, namely, the economic, social, and environmental dimensions. The review primarily attempts to provide answers to the following research question: What are the sustainable aspects of HFSCs? We provide a comprehensive analysis of the three critical components of sustainability, offering a broad and comprehensive picture of many critical issues in HFSCs.

"© 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. Epidemic outbreak (COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2) is an exceptional scenario of agri-food supply chain (AFSC) risk at the globalised level which is characterised by logistics’ network breakdown (ripple effects), demand mismatch (uncertainty), and sustainable issues. Thus, the aim of this research is the modelling of the sustainable based multi-tier system for AFSC, which is managed through the different emerging application of Internet of things (IoT) technology. Different IoT technologies, viz., Blockchain, robotics, Big data analysis, and cloud computing, have developed a competitive AFSC at the global level. Competitive AFSC needs cautious incorporation of multi-tiers suppliers, specifically during dealing with globalised sustainability issues. Firms have been advancing towards their multi suppliers for driving social, environments and economical practices. This paper also studies the interrelationship of 14 enablers and their cause and effect magnitude as contributing to IoT-based food secure model. The methodology used in the paper is interpretative structural modelling (ISM) for establishing interrelationship among the enablers and Fuzzy-Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (F-DEMATEL) to provide the magnitude of the cause-effect strength of the hierarchical framework. This paper also provides some theoretical contribution supported by information processing theory (IPT) and dynamic capability theory (DCT).

"© 2020 by the authors. In competitive global markets, sustainable suppliers are critical success factors for sustainable supply chain operations. Sustainable supplier selection must be based on a complex network of numerous indicators and experts’ fuzzy linguistic terms. Considering the correlation between the evaluation criteria and the ambiguity of the criteria values, this paper proposes combining the rough DEMATEL method and the fuzzy VIKOR (FVIKOR) method to solve sustainable supplier selection problem. We determine 15 sustainable supplier evaluation criteria from economic, environmental and social dimensions. We also apply the rough DEMATEL method to determine the weight of evaluation indicators that are interrelated or even conflicting and use the FVIKOR method to determine supplier rankings by converting the fuzzy linguistic terms into precise information.

"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. An inventory management problem is addressed for a make-to-order supply chain that has inventory holding and/or manufacturing locations at each node. The lead times between nodes and production capacity limits are heterogeneous across the network. This study focuses on a single product, a multi-period centralized system in which a retailer is subject to an uncertain stationary consumer demand at each time period. Two sales scenarios are considered for any unfulfilled demand: backlogging or lost sales. The daily inventory replenishment requests from immediate suppliers throughout the network are modeled and optimized using three different approaches: (1) deterministic linear programming, (2) multi-stage stochastic linear programming, and (3) reinforcement learning. The performance of the three methods is compared and contrasted in terms of profit (reward), service level, and inventory profiles throughout the supply chain. The proposed optimization strategies are tested in a stochastic simulation environment that was built upon the open-source OR-Gym Python package. The results indicate that, of the three approaches, stochastic modeling yields the largest increase in profit, whereas reinforcement learning creates more balanced inventory policies that would potentially respond well to network disruptions. Furthermore, deterministic models perform well in determining dynamic reorder policies that are comparable to reinforcement learning in terms of their profitability.",Algorithmic approaches to inventory management optimization,Inventory management *** Multi-echelon *** Reinforcement learning *** Stochastic programming *** Supply chain,processes,85099846631,2021,0,,,,,
"IEEE This short paper argues that technical leaders in a post Covid-19 world should adopt stakeholder-oriented management techniques tailored to complex, chaotic and disordered domains. In part this is because the unprecedented breadth of the novel coronavirus&#x0027;s impact has required organizations to strengthen their stakeholder orientation, given the second-order, network effects of management decisions during a global pandemic on unseen, unknown constituencies. In part this is because even our causal models and modes of group sense-making have been affected by the suffering and uncertainty caused by the pandemic. This paper draws from ongoing research on complex stakeholder networks, applying recent advances in graph theory to establish that organizations with more resilient, more efficient, more globally connected stakeholder networks better satisfy the claims of their stakeholders, across an array of financial and environmental, social and governance metrics. This research can be extended into post-crisis, chaotic and disordered domains by adapting the Cynefin framework, from the Welsh word for habitat, and applying it to the stakeholder theory literature. This stakeholder network perspective yields surprisingly simple and relevant tools for managers, as shown by a case study of the real-world performance of large US firms during the period of Covid-19&#x0027;s initial diffusion and impact.",Managing in a post Covid-19 world: a stakeholder network perspective,assortativity *** clustering *** Complexity theory *** Covid-19 *** COVID-19 *** Cynefin *** network resilience *** Organizations *** Pandemics *** social networks *** Stakeholders *** Stakeholders *** supply networks *** Taxonomy *** Tools,ieee engineering management review,85100856979,2021,0,,,,,
"© 2020 The objective of this study was to understand the impacts of COVID-19 crisis in agriculture and food systems in Nepal and assess the effectiveness of measures to deal with this crisis. The study draws policy implications, especially for farming systems resilience and the achievement of SDGs 1 and 2. The findings are based on (i) three panel discussions over six months with policy makers and experts working at grassroots to understand and manage the crisis, (ii) key informants' interviews, and (iii) an extensive literature review. Results revealed that the lockdown and transport restrictions have had severe consequences, raising questions on the achievement of SDGs 1 and 2, especially in the already vulnerable regions dependent on food-aid. This crisis has also exposed the strengths and limitations of both subsistence and commercial farming systems in terms of resiliency, offering important lessons for policy makers. Traditional subsistence farming appears to be somewhat resilient, with a potential to contribute to key pillars of food security, especially access and stability, though with limited contributions to food availability because of low productivity. On the other hand, commercial farming - limited to the periphery of market centres, cities, and emerging towns and in the accessible areas - was more impacted due to the lack of resilient supply networks to reach even the local market. Lower resiliency of commercial farming was also evident because of its growing dependence on inputs (mainly seeds and fertilizer) on distant markets located in foreign countries. The observation of crisis over eight months unleashed by the pandemic clearly revealed that wage labourers, indigenous people, and women from marginalized groups and regions already vulnerable in food security and malnutrition suffered more due to COVID-19 as they lost both external support and the coping mechanisms. The findings have implications for policies to improve both subsistence and commercial farming systems – in particular the former by improving the productivity through quality inputs and by diversifying, promoting and protecting the indigenous food system, while the latter through sustainable intensification by building reliant supply network linking farming with markets and guarantying the supply of inputs.",COVID-19 impacts on agriculture and food systems in Nepal: Implications for SDGs,COVID-19 pandemic *** Food security *** Food sovereignty *** Subsistence farming *** Sustainable development goals *** System resilience,agricultural systems,85095951110,2021,1,0,,,,
"© 2021, Editorial Department of CIMS. All right reserved. Focusing on tree-shaped supply chain system consisting of plants, distribution centers and retailers, an appropriate network structrue design approach was developed. By considering demand uncertainty of the retailers and interruption risks of the plants and distribution centers, a supply chain location-inventory decision model with the goal of minimizing expected total cost of the system was established. The model could be used to determine the locations, number and storage capacities of the distribution centers, as well as the replenishment / delivery assignment level of each plant / distribution center to each distribution center / retailer. To rapidly solve the proposed model, a hybrid genetic algorithm with a specific cost analysis method embedded in the genetic algorithm framework was designed, and the operation ideas and implementation steps of the algorithm were given. In addition, the experiments were constructed to verify the effectiveness of the model and its algorithm, and the deduction was obtained simultaneously that under uncertain demand environment, the decision result by considering multi-echelon facility interruptions was better than those without considering facility interruptions or considering only single-echelon facility interruptions.",Supply chain location-inventory decision model and its optimization algorithm with multi-echelon facility disruptions,Hybrid genetic algorithm *** Location-inventory model *** Multi-echelon facility disruption *** Supply chain network optimization *** Uncertain demand,"jisuanji jicheng zhizao xitong/computer integrated manufacturing systems, cims",85101019638,2021,1,,,,,
"In planning for a large-scale disaster, potential relief centers to accommodate evacuees need to be identified. The quantities of emergency commodities are prepared and stocked at relief centers in advance for possible disasters. In the event of a disaster, due to the different disaster severities and uncertain environment, some relief centers inevitably have surplus commodities, whereas some relief centers are still unmet. To use any surplus commodities effectively, a multi-commodity rebalancing process is necessary to rebalance the commodities among relief centers. However, various uncertainties make the multi-commodity rebalancing process extremely challenging, including uncertain demand and transportation-network availability. By recognizing those practical uncertainties, a bi-level stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is proposed to formulate this multi-commodity rebalancing problem. The upper-level objective is to minimize the total dissatisfaction level, which is measured by the expected total weighted unsatisfied demand, and the lower-level objective is to minimize the expected total transportation time. Finally, a case study on the Great Sichuan Earthquake in China is implemented; their results show that the proposed model facilitates effective decision-making in the practice of multi-commodity rebalancing.",A bi-level stochastic optimization model for multi-commodity rebalancing under uncertainty in disaster response,Humanitarian logistics *** Multi-commodity rebalancing *** Bi-level stochastic programming *** Uncertainty,annals of operations research,WOS:000574636800001,2021,0,,,,,
"This paper aims to develop a scenario-based optimization framework to deals with several issues related to redesign sustainable reverse supply chain; focused particularly in the epistemic uncertainty of supply and demand input parameters and their relationship with supply chain performance, both important for the redesign problem. The two-step optimization framework starts with a Fuzzy Inference System methodology for scenario generation that faces the lack of information, and the necessity of estimate the expected operation cost and environmental impact. Then we use generated scenarios into the epsilon-constraint method which solves a multi-objective model to obtain a relevant set of solutions. After solving the second optimization model, we propose to analyze the robustness of the achieved redesign solutions considering a customer satisfaction approach. The computational experiments show that our proposed framework supports better the inclusion of scenarios for redesigning the plastic recycling supply chain. Furthermore, we study a real-life plastic recycling problem in Cuba which demonstrates that the framework is able to support the redesign decision making with robust solutions sensitive to the changes of the studied uncertain parameters.",A fuzzy inference based scenario building in two-stage optimization framework for sustainable recycling supply chain redesign,Fuzzy inference system *** Reverse supply chain design *** Plastic recycling *** Scenario generation,expert systems with applications,WOS:000602356300007,2021,0,,,,,
"The growing concerns for achieving sustainability has gained much attention from waste management experts with particular focus on reverse logistics, as it supports concepts like circular economy, material recovery, and improved environmental performances. This paper describes a multi-stage network-based model to minimize the overall cost for the reverse logistics management of inert construction waste across its entire life cycle. This model takes a unique two-type costing approach to overcome the ambiguities and deficiencies existing in previous models. Type-I cost refers to the facility-based costing (FBC) and Type-II cost refers to non-facility based costing (NFBC). The mixed-integer linear programming technique is applied using the LINGO software. A case study of construction waste management in Hong Kong is conducted to validate the developed model, which includes waste generation point as the starting node, public fill reception facility and recycling facility as an intermediate node, and landfill as an ending node. The result shows about 24% reduction in the total cost compared to the base case. Furthermore, to evaluate the impact of uncertainties on the cost parameters, a detailed scenario based sensitivity analysis is conducted. The optimal result shows that the larger portion of total cost come from the NFBC component. Therefore, NFBC is critical in defining the overall reverse logistics network and thus, should be given more emphasis in the design of an effective construction waste management system.

"The use of biomass pellets as a source of renewable energy has increased in recent times. However, pellet storage during transportation can compromise their properties, due to fluctuating temperature and humid environments. Here, we show that extended storage of one month at 40 degrees C and 85% relative humidity causes significant biomass pellet degradation. This was evidenced by higher pellet porosity, weight gain, increased inclusion body formation and creation of an internal network of cracks. We quantify the inclusion and pore growth processes at the surface and within the pellets, which has implications for subsequent thermochemical conversion. The global bioenergy transition may depend upon biomass pellets, and this study shows that storage conditions are critical in the supply chain, so to maintain their quality. Without the development of stronger policies to avoid premature degradation of biomass pellets, they may not realize their full potential as a bioenergy source.",Microstructural degradation during the storage of biomass pellets, ,communications materials,WOS:000608005300006,2021,0,0,,,,
"Indonesia has reevaluated its archipelagic logistics system to implement a strategic shift from a point-to-point network to a hub-and-spoke network, with a plan to establish seven new regional distribution centers (RDCs). To supplement the previous qualitative assessment of the plan and to potentially justify continuing with its implementation, this paper aims to evaluate the prospective long-term performance of the planned RDCs within a hub-and-spoke (HS) network. The chosen methodology for this analysis is a hybrid of optimization and simulation, using an agent-based modeling and simulation platform that incorporates a geographic information system (GIS) element to provide a realistic geographical context. This constitutes a relatively novel innovation in logistics research. Experiments were developed to estimate the logistics performance of the hub-and-spoke network and planned RDCs, as well as to identify potential problems such as bottlenecks at the RDCs and the relative (in)efficiency of the selected multimodal transport. Transport costs, inventory costs, and the order backlog of RDCs are evaluated based on the average results from 100 replications. Outcomes from the model are validated against empirical data on Indonesia's logistics costs from the World Bank. Model results indicate that the hub-and-spoke network performs better than the point-to-point network when it comes to transportation costs. Since this is found to be the dominant element of total logistics costs, appropriate modal choice and route optimization are, therefore, critical to reducing logistics costs. The planned RDCs are found to have significant imbalance in their loadings, which is likely to produce bottlenecks. The paper concludes that a planned move to a hub-and spoke system is appropriate and that the planned investment in the RDCs is therefore justified. However, there is a need to streamline the predicted loadings at the RDCs to avoid bottlenecks. Our results suggest that the government should reopen the case and reevaluate the locations and coverage of each RDC. More generically, it is concluded that the application of hybrid optimization and simulation using agent-based modeling and simulation is feasible and the methodological approach adopted herein is generalizable to other archipelagic logistics systems.",Simulating long-term performance of regional distribution centers in archipelagic logistics systems,Archipelagic logistics system *** Agent-based modeling *** Hybrid optimization and simulation *** Regional distribution center (RDC) *** Long-term logistics performance,maritime economics & logistics,WOS:000569497000001,2021,0,0,,,,
"Natural disasters not only inflict massive life and economic losses but also result in psychological damage to survivors, at times even causing social unrest. It is necessary to design a sustainable last mile relief network for distributing relief supplies regarding social factors, disaster relief efficiency as well as the economic cost of three perspectives in terms of sustainability. We establish a multi-objective distributionally robust optimization model for a sustainable last mile relief network problem that maximizes the equitable distribution of relief supplies and simultaneously minimizes the transportation time and operation cost. Under the partial probability information of uncertainties, such as the disaster situation, transportation time, freight, road capacity, and demand, we characterize the uncertain variables in an ambiguity set incorporating the bounds, means and the mean absolute deviations. Then, the bounds on the objective values and the safe approximations of the chance constraints are deduced under the ambiguity sets. Based on a revised multi-choice goal programming approach, we obtain a computationally tractable framework of the multi-objective model. To verify the effectiveness of the model and methods, a case study of the Banten tsunami is illustrated. The results demonstrate our proposed model can obtain a trade-off between the equitability, timeliness and economics for relief distribution in a relief network.",A multi-objective distributionally robust model for sustainable last mile relief network design problem,Last mile relief network *** Sustainability *** Equitable distribution *** Distributionally robust optimization *** Multi-objective *** Ambiguity set,annals of operations research,WOS:000577939800003,2021,1,1,,,,

"Supply chain risk management embroils quite a lot of situations of managerial decision-making under uncertainties. As contemporary supply chains are intricate networks exposed to ample vulnerabilities, a resilient supply chain with inbuilt capabilities for responding to unanticipated events can assume significance. This paper proposes a decision support model for managers for knowing, measuring and improving the level of resilience in manufacturing supply chains. A novel computational methodology involving the incidence analysis and grey theory is proposed in this study. Using the methodology of advanced analysis of grey incidences, the level of resilience of supply chains can be measured. Various strategies and attributes imparting resilience, particularly relevant to the manufacturing industry are analyzed in this research. A framework considering five strategies and twenty-three attributes contributing to supply chain resilience is also constructed. And a case evaluation has been conducted to implementing the proposed methodology. Managers can ascertain their supply chain resilience capabilities by means of synthetic resilience index, as recommended in this study. From the measures of resilience for the bygone period, top management can assess and improve the resilience capabilities of their supply chain, by taking strategic level decisions.

"Viability is the ability of a supply chain (SC) to maintain itself and survive in a changing environment through a redesign of structures and replanning of performance with long-term impacts. In this paper, we theorize a new notion-the viable supply chain (VSC). In our approach, viability is considered as an underlying SC property spanning three perspectives, i.e., agility, resilience, and sustainability. The principal ideas of the VSC model are adaptable structural SC designs for supply-demand allocations and, most importantly, establishment and control of adaptive mechanisms for transitions between the structural designs. Further, we demonstrate how the VSC components can be categorized across organizational, informational, process-functional, technological, and financial structures. Moreover, our study offers a VSC framework within an SC ecosystem. We discuss the relations between resilience and viability. Through the lens and guidance of dynamic systems theory, we illustrate the VSC model at the technical level. The VSC model can be of value for decision-makers to design SCs that can react adaptively to both positive changes (i.e., the agility angle) and be able to absorb negative disturbances, recover and survive during short-term disruptions and long-term, global shocks with societal and economical transformations (i.e., the resilience and sustainability angles). The VSC model can help firms in guiding their decisions on recovery and re-building of their SCs after global, long-term crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We emphasize that resilience is the central perspective in the VSC guaranteeing viability of the SCs of the future. Emerging directions in VSC research are discussed.","Viable supply chain model: integrating agility, resilience and sustainability perspectives-lessons from and thinking beyond the COVID-19 pandemic",Supply chain *** Viability *** Resilience *** Sustainability *** Lean *** Agility *** COVID-19 *** Pandemic *** Recovery *** Viable supply chain,annals of operations research,WOS:000534841500001,2021,1,1,,,,
"Assessing the performance of an economy in times of crisis is a difficult task. This study presents an agent-based model capturing the behaviour of firms facing transport and supply disruptions due to natural disasters, and shows possible paths to reinforce infrastructure and supply chain resilience. Building resilience against shocks has become a pillar of sustainability. By understanding how the different components of an economy interact in times of crisis, we can design resilience strategies that go beyond building walls or dams. We formulate an original agent-based model to explore a crucial pathway through which a disaster affects the economy: the transport-supply chain nexus. The model simulates the behaviour of firms facing transport and supply disruptions and estimates the resulting indirect losses. As an illustration, the model is used to assess the criticality of Tanzanian roads, which are vulnerable to floods. We report three main results. First, the model generates maps that identify the transport infrastructure assets that are most critical for specific supply chains: roads that are most important for food security are different from those supporting international trade, for instance. Second, economic losses from transport disruptions increase non-linearly with the duration of disruptions, highlighting the benefit from fast repairs. Third, by combining economic and transport modelling, we can consider a broader spectrum of interventions. Beyond strengthening the transport system, it is also possible to make supply chains more resilient to disruption with, for instance, sourcing decisions or inventory management.",Criticality analysis of a country's transport network via an agent-based supply chain model, ,nature sustainability,WOS:000598708000008,2021,1,1,,,,
"Two frameworks, hypothetical extraction and betweenness centrality analysis, can be used to identify environmentally important sectors in complex supply chains. This study derives an analytic expression for the relationship between hypothetical extraction and betweenness centrality analysis. Second, using the Eora and WIOD, this study analyzes the degree of difference in 'important' sectors identified by hypothetical extraction and betweenness centrality analysis. While the results obtained by rank correlation yield similarities, both methods have advantages. This study demonstrates that estimating betweenness centrality is meaningful and less computationally expensive, and can help us to understand the structural positions in the global supply chain network. The hypothetical extraction indicators can be easily computed using the betweenness centrality indicators' mathematical relationship. We conclude that the implementation of effective CO2-reduction polices through greener global supply chain engagement center around two key sectors, chemical and metal products from China, and their higher betweenness centrality should be strengthened.","Hypothetical extraction, betweenness centrality, and supply chain complexity",Input-output analysis *** global supply chain analysis *** hypothetical extraction method *** network centrality analysis *** key sector analysis,economic systems research,WOS:000599661400001,2021,1,1,,,,
"Understanding a supply chain (SC) leader's role from a collaborative capability management perspective offers insights into strategically managing exchange relationships during disruptions. This study illustrates the importance of leadership responsibility in managing overall resilience capabilities among SC network members. Using insights drawn from leadership theory, SC leader-member exchange (LMX) is operationalised to measure levels in exchange relationships. Furthermore, an integrative probabilistic-reliability management approach is applied to explore the impact of SCLMX on SC network resilience performance. The findings reveal (i) the significant role a buyer's leadership can play in improving SC capabilities; (ii) the asymmetric roles of different capabilities in resilience improvement; and (iii) the need to further investigate the relationship between SC capabilities and resilience based on disruption phases.

"In recent times, Supply chains are required to undergo the structural changes in order to adapt to the positive events such as Industry 4.0 and negative events such as natural and man-made disasters. Both positive and negative events tend to cause disruptions and affect business operations continuity. Supplier selection, being the critical and foremost activity must ensure that selected suppliers are capable of supporting the organizations against disruptions caused by these events. Hence, supplier selection and order allocation must be restructured considering the dynamics of Industry 4.0 and disaster events to ensure undisrupted flow of materials across supply chain. The paper proposes a multi stage hybrid model for integrated supplier segmentation, selection and order allocation considering risks and disruptions. The suppliers are then evaluated based on set of criteria suitable in Industry 4.0 environment using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and are further prioritized using Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FAHP-TOPSIS). The risk associated with each supplier is computed. The paper also proposes a Mixed Integer Program (MIP) as to optimize multi-period, multi item order allocation to suppliers in such a way that overall cost and risk of disruption is simultaneously minimized. In event of any disruption either from supply or demand side, the multi-stage hybrid model tends to reduce its economic impact by allocating emergency orders, thus, ensuring business operations continuity.

"Maritime Knowledge Clusters (MKCs) are the advanced stage in the evolution path of maritime clusters. Earlier literature however mostly focused on either the characteristics i.e. critical success factors or competitiveness of maritime clusters in general and not on the components of MKCs, their interrelationships, and impact on the performance of constituent firms. This study proposes and tests a conceptual model of Maritime Knowledge Clusters (MKC) and the relations between their components, making use of survey data from 203 shipping professionals located in Singapore. Three theoretical perspectives, namely, relational view, knowledge-based view and resource-based view, have been employed. The results demonstrate that MKCs are substantiated by three critical components, in which the local knowledge cluster can develop global systemic mechanisms, thus further strengthening global linkages. Policy makers must endeavor to create a conducive local cluster environment with maritime firms being located in geographical proximity, and having local networks, knowledge base, and knowledge flows. They form the fundamental foundation for the growth of MKCs. Besides, maritime firms shall optimize the MKC's local knowledge cluster to facilitate their global expansion, which will in turn boost the internationalization of the MKC.",Maritime knowledge clusters: A conceptual model and empirical evidence,Maritime knowledge clusters *** Relational view theory *** Knowledge-based view theory *** Resource-based view theory *** Maritime industry *** Singapore,marine policy,WOS:000600321500005,2021,0,,,,,
"This paper addresses the design and planning of a supply chain (SC) system for power generation from biomass by using various technologies. A two-stage stochastic programming model is developed to find an effective design strategy under stochastic and highly seasonal biomass supply. The biomass usage, as a renewable energy source, for the power generation affects the environment and society in multiple ways, such as social expectations, life-threatening issues, and greenhouse gas emissions. As a consequence, in the stochastic model, by the social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) approach, the SC's social impact is guaranteed to be larger than a minimum acceptable rate. Furthermore, the environmental risk of the SC is quantified based on its air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions and mitigated. To deal with the biomass supply uncertainty, discrete scenarios are generated using a backward scenario reduction approach. Computational results are presented on a real-life case study in Iran to show the stochastic model's applicability in evaluating the economic potential, the sustainability aspects, and the required infrastructure for the planning of the SC system. In addition, to drive managerial insights, sensitivity analysis on key parameters of the optimisation problem is done.",Sustainable supply chain planning for biomass-based power generation with environmental risk and supply uncertainty considerations: a real-life case study,Biomass *** Power generation *** Supply Chain planning *** Stochastic programming *** Sustainable development *** Environmental risk,international journal of production research,WOS:000528471400001,2021,1,1,,,,
"Companies are under pressure to re-engineer their supply chains to 'go green' while simultaneously improving their resilience to cope with unexpected disruptions where the supplier selection decision plays a strategic role. We present a new approach to supplier evaluation and allocating the optimal order quantity from each supplier with respect to green and resilience (gresilience) characteristics. An integrated framework that considers traditional business, green and resilience criteria and sub-criteria was developed, followed by a calculation of importance weight of criteria and sub-criteria using analytical hierarchy process (AHP). We evaluate suppliers using the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The obtained weights from AHP and TOPSIS were integrated into a developed multi-objective programming model used as an order allocation planner and the epsilon-constraint method was used to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. TOPSIS was applied to select the final Pareto solution based on its closeness from the ideal solution. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach was illustrated using a real case study through a comparatively meaningful ranking of suppliers.

"Nowadays, some burgeoning issues occurring in green and sustainable supply chain face an increasing number of tackles, including uncertain factors and unobserved data, which makes it even more complicated to assess supply chain efficiency. To address this issue, this paper applies uncertainty theory to two-stage network DEA intending to deal with inaccurate data. Moreover, the bi-echelon supply chain generally suffers asymmetric power among involved members. Therefore, this paper proposes attrition rate (D) and fulfillment rate (G) in the first and second stages respectively so as to reveal the bi-echelon supply chain within different leader-follower patterns. The first two models assume the upstream firm is the leader while the last two models regard the downstream firm as the leader. We find out that the results of the evaluation vary under divergent patterns accordingly by running a numerical example.

"Purpose The research study aims to investigate green supply chain management (GSCM) elements as part of a complete system. It aims to understand the special properties of the GSCM system under the moderating effects of product complexity and purchasing structure. Design/methodology/approach A thorough literature review led to the building of the conceptual framework. Six constructs were identified using systems theory. These constructs include green supply chain technological dimensions (particularly, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based), green supply chain strategy, green supply chain process, product complexity, purchasing structure, and firm performance. The instrument was scientifically developed for gathering survey responses using complete design test methods. The conceptual model was eventually tested based on survey data collected from 250 automotive components and allied manufacturers in the emerging economy of South Africa. Findings The results indicate that GSCM technological dimensions (AI-based) positively influence GSCM strategy. Further, GSCM strategy was found to positively influence the GSCM process. The GSCM processes have significant effects on environmental performance, social performance, and financial performance. The product complexity has a significant moderation effect on the paths GSCM strategy and GSCM process. Originality/value The findings from multivariate data analysis provide a better understanding of GSCM system dynamics and are helpful to key decision-makers.

"The implementation of a cyclic production scheduling approach has been shown to enhance resource utilization and to improve shop floor control. Recently, closed-loop supply chain management has become a topic of strategic importance due to its positive environmental and economic impacts. As a result, many organizations integrated manufacturing and remanufacturing operations to optimize the efficiency of their forward and reverse supply chain processes. The focus of this research is to integrate cyclic production scheduling policies in a two-stage closed-loop supply chain. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program to generate an optimal cyclic production schedule with no demand shortages that minimizes the sum of holding and setup costs under a given cyclic delivery schedule required by the customer. The results of the sensitivity analysis revealed that the number of products, the product return rate, and the feasibility ratio are the most critical parameters affecting the model computational performance. For large-sized problems, a heuristic procedure is proposed to generate near optimal production schedules in reasonable computational times. Finally, the illustration of the proposed integrated model with a real case study demonstrated the cost advantage of implementing cyclic production schedules under closed-loop supply chain policy versus cyclic production schedules under manufacturing only policy.

"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd The fast depletion of fossil fuels and adverse environmental impact from combustion have triggered an urgent need for new, cleaner and sustainable energy resources. In the last few decades, biodiesel has been introduced as an alternative due to its advantages over fossil fuels, which include higher flash point, improved lubricity, and lower toxicity. However, high production cost of biodiesel is one of the major hindrances in making the commercial feasibility of biodiesel viable. Biodiesel can be obtained from various sources such as waste cooking oil, vegetable oil, animal fat, etc. Among these sources, animal fat which is a non-edible feedstock and currently being used in low-cost processes is one of the best options. To make the commercial feasibility of biodiesel viable, this research presents an animal fat-based biodiesel supply chain network design optimization model. The suggested optimization model minimizes the cost of total biodiesel supply chain operations besides minimizing the carbon emissions during the involved operations. The complex and dynamic business environment of the biodiesel supply chain leads to a high degree of uncertainty, as a result, the effectiveness of strategic level decisions is compromised. To model this uncertainty, a solution methodology based on robust possibilistic programming (RPP) is employed. To show the applicability of the proposed model and solution methodology, numerical experiments and sensitivity analysis on a real case study is performed. Case results depict that RPP based solution methodology can achieve efficient solutions having a high degree of robustness. The experimental results also indicate that by investing almost 16% higher cost, the strategic and tactical level decisions of the proposed biodiesel supply chain model can be secured against the inherent uncertainty. It is also revealed that for the given case, logistics-related activities are almost 80% of the total supply chain cost, which if managed efficiently, can play a significant role in making the commercial feasibility of biodiesel doable. The proposed model and its findings can be efficiently utilized by the policymakers and investors in the animal fat-based biodiesel production sector.",A robust possibilistic programming approach toward animal fat-based biodiesel supply chain network design under uncertain environment,Animal fat *** Biodiesel *** Carbon emissions *** Robust possibilistic programming *** Supply chain management,journal of cleaner production,85090279053,2021,1,0,,,,

"© 2021 Elsevier Ltd Addressing dual crisis of fossil fuels i.e. environmental as well as gradually decreasing reserves, design of a nationwide robust supply chain network based on bio-energy has been presented in this work. The four echelon supply chain caters the target of blending 20% bio fuels with conventional fuel during 2018–2026. The mixed integer linear programming model considers handling of multiple types of feed sources, products, transport options while performing the techno, economic and environmental analysis of the supply chain to optimally determine the operational and design decisions. The uncertainty in demand, import product price and biomass feed supply has been tackled using data driven robust optimization approach developed using fuzzy transcription of discontinuous uncertain parameter space using machine learning based unsupervised learning methods. To handle a ∼50% increase in overall biofuel demand over the nine-year planning horizon, the deterministic model shows a dynamically changing supply chain with a ∼20% increase in the newly added locations; however, the worst case robust optimization results are reported to be 6% leaner than the results obtained for the deterministic model. The sensitivity analysis of biomass availability on net present value indicates the need of 43% and above biomass feed supply to run such bio supply chain sector to survive.",Achieving wealth from bio-waste in a nationwide supply chain setup under uncertain environment through data driven robust optimization approach,Bio-waste *** Machine learning *** MILP *** Neuro fuzzy clustering *** Robust optimization *** Supply chain uncertainty,journal of cleaner production,85100197021,2021,1,1,,,,
"© 2021 This article describes and discusses nominated procurement as a means through which buyers select sub-suppliers to achieve sustainability compliance upstream in emerging economies' supply chains. Hence, it critically examines the ways buyers articulate nominated procurement and the unfolding supply chain consequences. Based on in-depth interviews and fieldwork in the Sri Lankan apparel supply chain, the findings indicate that buyers accomplish sustainability compliance among their sub-suppliers while prioritizing their own business agenda. In doing so, however, buyers perpetuate “suboptimal compliance” of raw material suppliers and “sandwiching” of direct suppliers as harmful consequences on the supply chain. These consequences link theoretically with commercial, geographical, compliance and extended-compliance pressure. This article contributes to the advancement of the Sustainable Supply Chain Management literature by theorizing about nominated procurement, direct and indirect pressure, and pointing to the supply chain consequences beyond achievements in sustainability compliance.",Nominated procurement and the indirect control of nominated sub-suppliers: Evidence from the Sri Lankan apparel supply chain,Business networks *** Emerging economies *** Nominated procurement *** Sandwiching *** Sustainability compliance *** Sustainable Supply Chain Management,journal of business research,85100382982,2021,0,0,,,,
"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd The terrorist attack on the Abqaiq oil plant in Saudi Arabia on September 14, 2019 attracted global attention to the significant role of safety and security in the sustainable oil and gas supply chain and the vulnerability of supply infrastructures subject to intentional and unintentional damages. Different from other oil and gas supply infrastructures, oil and gas pipelines may be more vulnerable to accidental, natural and intentional threats due to their widespread distribution. Therefore a systematic and thorough review is carried out to investigate safety and security of oil and gas pipelines based on bibliometric analysis. First, a total of 598 publications between 1970 and 2019 related to safety and security of oil and natural gas pipelines was retrieved and refined from the database of Web of Science (WoS). The 598 publications are analyzed by the bibliometric software VOSviewer to obtain the temporal and regional distribution of publications, to identify “productive institutions” and “productive authors”, and create the cooperation networks between institutions and authors. Besides, the evolution of research topics and research methods are identified based on keywords and bibliographic analysis. Moreover, the main research topics and research methods are analyzed to obtain insight into the research evolutions and trends. Risk assessment, leakage, and corrosion are the main topics while QRA, fuzzy theory and the Bayesian network are the most frequently used research methods. To further improve the sustainability of oil and gas pipelines, this study provides and discusses future research needs such as pipeline security, environmental sustainability, pipeline system resilience. According to these results, the research on risk assessment based on Bayesian network and consequence analysis using CFD may increase in the future. Besides, more research and guidelines on pipeline security, resilience, and environmental impacts to better protect pipelines, are expected.",Safety and security of oil and gas pipeline transportation: A systematic analysis of research trends and future needs using WoS,Bibliometric analysis *** Oil and gas pipelines *** Research evolution *** Safety and security *** Sustainable transportation,journal of cleaner production,85089951559,2021,0,0,,,,
"© 2020 Elsevier Inc. Green closed-loop supply chain (GCLSC) is a supply chain that encompasses forward and reverse flows of components and products in logistic networks with a focus on economic and environmental performance. In the decision-making process of GCLSC, the presence of uncertainty and risk originating from the size and complexity of network is crucial to consider, and the distribution of uncertain parameter may be ambiguous. To characterize the ambiguity caused by distributional perturbation, a novel ambiguity distribution set is proposed, and further a new upside risk: upper partial moment with power q is introduced to quantify the economic risk in the GCLSC. Subsequently, a distributionally robust fuzzy GCLSC network design model which attempts to optimize the worst-case performance of the network is developed with the perspective of a trade-off between upside risk and expectation of economic cost. To format a sustainable GCLSC paradigm, the policy of carbon cap is adopted to control carbon emissions in terms of environmental constraints. Furthermore, the tractable counterpart of the proposed model is obtained by transforming distributionally robust credibility objective and constraints into their equivalent forms under ambiguous distribution of uncertain parameter. Finally, a case study on Coca-Cola Company in Northeast China is investigated to test and verify the proposed model. The advantage of proposed model is demonstrated through comparative study on distribution ambiguity free and without environmental constraint problem. Computational results reveal that the proposed model has superior capability of immunity against the risk of distribution ambiguity.",A novel robust fuzzy mean-UPM model for green closed-loop supply chain network design under distribution ambiguity,Ambiguity distribution set *** Carbon emissions *** Distributionally robust *** Green closed-loop supply chain *** Mixed-integer programming *** Upper partial moment,applied mathematical modelling,85096650626,2021,1,1,,,,
"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd Food and water resources are closely interconnected through economic supply chains. Existing studies have identified critical sectors as either direct water users or food consumers indirectly driving upstream water uses. However, sectors acting as intermediate transmission centres in the virtual water network driven by final food demand are overlooked. Production efficiency improvement of these critical transmission sectors (i.e., using less upstream inputs to produce unitary output) could indirectly reduce water uses of the whole supply chains. Taking China as the case, this study identifies critical transmission sectors for food-water nexus at the provincial level, based on an environmentally-extended multi-regional input-output model and the concept of betweenness. Results show that the agricultural products sectors in Shandong, Heilongjiang, and Hubei are the top three transmission sectors. They transmit 4.6, 4.1, and 3.0 billion m3 of embodied water resources, respectively. Some important transmission sectors, such as the cotton in Xinjiang and chemical industry in Jiangsu, cannot be identified by production-based and consumption-based methods. Results also highlight the necessity of strengthening inter-regional and inter-sectoral cooperation, because partial critical transmission sectors are not located in the demand provinces. Betweenness-based results can provide additional hotspots for developing sector-oriented policies for the synergistic management of food and water resources.",Critical transmission sectors for provincial food-water nexus in China,Betweenness *** Input-output analysis *** Network analysis *** Nexus *** Trade *** Virtual water,journal of cleaner production,85090143053,2021,0,0,,,,
"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd Biorefineries provide a platform for different industries to produce multiple bio-products enhancing the economic value of the system. The production of these biorefineries has led to an increase in the generation of biowaste. To minimize the risk of environmental pollution, numerous studies have focused on a variety of strategies to mitigate these concerns reflected in the vast amount of literature written on this topic. This paper aims to systematically analyze and review the enormous body of scientific literature in the biowaste and biorefinery field for establishing an understanding and providing a direction for future works. A bibliometric analysis is first performed using the CorTexT Manager platform on a corpus of 1488 articles written on the topic of biowaste. Popular and emerging topics are determined using a terms extraction algorithm. A contingency matrix is then created to study the correlation of scientific journals and key topics from this field. Then, the connection and evolution of these terms were analyzed using network mapping, to determine relationships among key terms and analyze notable trends in this research field. Finally, a critical review of articles was presented across three main categories of biowaste management such as mitigation, sustainable utilization, and cleaner disposal from the perspective of the biorefinery concept. Operational and technological challenges are identified for the integration of anaerobic digestion in biorefineries, especially in developing nations. Moreover, logistical challenges in the biorefinery supply-chain are established based on the economics and collection aspect of handling biowaste.",A state-of-the-art review of biowaste biorefinery,Anaerobic digestion *** Biorefinery *** Biowaste *** Cleaner disposal *** Mitigation *** Sustainable utilization,environmental pollution,85097225159,2021,0,0,,,,
"© 2020 E-waste problem is putting pressure on environmental agencies, government, original equipment manufacturers of developing nations like India to adopt, develop and innovate environment friendly e-waste mitigation strategies, with the objective to manage and control the ever growing threat of e-waste to the environment, society and human health. Moreover, increasing producer responsibility, informal recycling practices and disposal issues have given attention to adopt mitigation strategies for successful implementation of e-waste management system. This study acknowledges the critical strategies to recover resources along with processing and treatment of toxic and hazardous component of e-waste mitigation and management which is immediate and existing challenge for India. A combined framework based on Grey concept and DEMATEL technique has been proposed in this work to determine the interdependence among the e-waste mitigation strategies (MS) by cause/effect analysis. This study has revealed that ‘top management initiation and commitment towards return management’ is the most imperative and driving strategy in the e-waste management and control. It also influences the other existing strategies. This work has also highlighted that e-waste mitigation can be effective if it concentrates on effective implementation of e-waste policy, directives and regulations such as extended producer responsibility (EPR), advance recycling fee (ARF) etc., technological and green innovations in recycling network and strategic alliance among supply chain partners and e-waste recyclers (in-house and outsource service provider) in Indian scenario in the management of e-waste issues. The cause–effect relationships are helpful to the managers, Government agencies and policy makers to learn crucial causal strategies that require imperative emphasis in dealing with e-waste issues in India.

"© 2020 Lifelines and infrastructure systems are among the most critical operational components of an urban environment to ensure a minimum level of post-earthquake economic and societal functionality following major seismic events. The overall performance of lifeline systems after the September 19, 2017 Mw 7.1 Central Mexico earthquake was generally positive. The most extensive impact was observed on the fresh water supply network within Mexico City (CDMX), which resulted in the temporary loss of water supply for nearly six million people, yet expedited repair work and temporary solutions limited severe interruption of daily operations and helped mitigate human suffering. The road, railroad and bridge networks were reported to have experienced very limited damage. Less than a dozen bridges indicated some level of damage in the areas affected by the earthquake. Only few selected rail stations within the public transportation system of Mexico City (metro) were temporarily closed for up to one month due to structural damage. The electricity network was reestablished to its full capacity within four days. Several case studies in the regions ranging from Mexico City to the earthquake epicenter (Puebla) are presented in this paper to provide an overview of engineering success stories as well as opportunities alike.","The September 19, 2017 MW 7.1 CENTRAL-Mexico earthquake: Immediate observations on selected infrastructure systems",Airports *** Bridges *** Infrastructure *** Pipelines *** Reconnaissance *** Utility services,soil dynamics and earthquake engineering,85096027636,2021,0,0,,,,
"© 2020 Health, safety, and environmental (HSE) issues are an emerging concern in sustainable supply chain management. Global brands sourcing from high-risk suppliers in emerging markets affect not only brand reputation but also production schedules and product quality. Based on 198 safety and 458 environmental incidents among 318 manufacturing firms in China, we found that incident firms have higher abnormal unsystematic and systematic risk than matched sustainable suppliers without HSE incidents. Reducing operational complexity and coupling can mitigate both likelihood and abnormal risks.

"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd The devastating impact of the ripple effect increases the importance of the reverse supply chain (RSC) design to ensure sustainability in the long-term. That being the case, in this study, a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer optimization model is proposed to design an RSC network under uncertainty sourcing from the ripple effect (i.e. external side of RSC) by considering the environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability. The environmental and economic disruptions of the ripple effect are represented by the increase in the carbon emission levels and the distance of roads, and the decrease in the capacity of facilities, respectively. Accordingly, a set of scenarios is considered based on the disruption levels (low- and high-impact) in case of the ripple effect. Furthermore, an α-reliability constraint is integrated into the model to further analyze the occurrence of scenarios. The model allows us to make integrated operational and strategic decisions by placing an emphasis on the carbon emission levels (i.e. environmental dimension) and the total cost (i.e. economic dimension). To obtain some remarkable insights, the proposed model is validated through computational experiments based on data extracted from a real case. The computational results show that the ripple effect increases the emission level and total cost up to 40%. For this reason, it suggested that the regulations regarding WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) should be prepared by considering sustainability in the entire RSC network. Besides, it is realized that the centralized distribution strategy leads to a more resilient RSC network design.",Ensuring sustainability in the reverse supply chain in case of the ripple effect: A two-stage stochastic optimization model,Reverse supply chain (RSC) *** Ripple effect *** Two-stage stochastic optimization,journal of cleaner production,85095741569,2021,1,1,,,,
"© 2020 This paper provides an overview of the evolution and state-of-the-art of the Operations Research and Management Science (OR/MS) subject area from 1956 to 2019. Using text mining techniques on the content of the title, abstract, and author keywords of papers classified by the Web of Science as literature review studies in OR/MS, we found that there are 76 topical consolidated clusters in the field covering a wide range of reviewed topics. Since 2015, reviews on supply chain risk management and big data analytics have had the highest impact in the field, whereas topics such as Industry 4.0, socio-technical systems, social networks, green supply, sustainable supply chain, and resilience engineering have all received significant attention from researchers. Reviews on analytic hierarchy process were found to be the most impactful overall, showing the high relevance of multi-criteria decision making in the current research and practice contexts. Furthermore, a text mining analysis of the papers citing OR/MS literature reviews showed that optimization continues to be one of the most highly influential methodological contributions of OR/MS to other research areas and that topics such as circular economy, carbon emissions, and social commerce have yet to find some traction in OR/MS research, suggesting future research and multidisciplinary opportunities for the field. Results also show that the research area of Public Administration has been greatly influenced by OR/MS reviews as 16% of all the papers published in that field have cited at least one of the 1744 review papers included in this study.

"© 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature. More and more enterprises hope to achieve cooperation and win–win. However, many companies often have problems such as insufficient partner credit, which seriously affects the quality of cooperation. In order to effectively evaluate the credit, this paper constructs a personal credit evaluation model. The model compares the weight adjustment method with BP neural network and other methods. Compared with the BP neural network weight adjustment algorithm, the improved algorithm has obvious advantages in accuracy and convergence speed. The simulation results show that the green supply chain cooperation credit evaluation model can better evaluate the environmental behavior of enterprises. The BP neural network can better solve the problem of slow convergence and premature convergence, and can search data more accurately. The algorithm has good robustness. The evaluation model has high optimization accuracy, which shows that BP neural network can better learn and evaluate the credit of green supply chain at different levels.",Evaluation model of green supply chain cooperation credit based on BP neural network,BP neural network *** Cooperation credit *** Green supply chain *** Weight adjustment,neural computing and applications,85094176310,2021,0,0,,,,
"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd Inevitable disruptions and undesired environmental effects perturb food supply chains and meat supply chains. Academics and practitioners need to simultaneously incorporate resilience and greenness perspectives in planning approaches since this context has not been investigated in the existing literature. At the tactical level, it requires advanced modelling and solution approaches. In this research, a novel bi-objective stochastic model is developed to cover specific characteristics of meat inventory planning in a three-echelon network. Two resiliency strategies are embedded in the model to hedge against the disruptions. Disruptions behavior in the food context is characterized to illustrate real-world situations as stochastic processes using the Monte-Carlo method. To solve the model, sample average approximation and Lexicographic Weighted Tchebycheff methods are derived. Numerous problem instances are conducted to validate the applicability of the proposed model and solution approach. The results reiterate that resilient solutions could retain the network performance and even increase it by 6%. It is also concluded that solutions are sensitive to the throughput capacity and lead-time by 13% and 41%, respectively.

"© 2020 The use of renewable energies has become very attractive, because it protects the environment and boosts regional development. In this paper, a sustainable two-phase sequential approach is proposed for the design of bioenergy SCs under uncertainties. The first phase, integrating geographical information, social aspects, and multi-criteria decision-making techniques, helps find appropriate locations for the bio-refineries. High rates of unemployment, and high vulnerability to the variation in the markets in an economic crisis are considered as social concerns. Integrating these factors filters the areas for the second phase. The first phase reduces complexity in the computation of the problem, and helps set up sustainable development in the supply chain. In the second phase, to cope with the uncertainties in the bioenergy supply network, a robust model is introduced. It reduces the sensitivity to inaccurate input data, and the obtained solutions stay optimal when the parameters change slightly. In order to validate this two-phase sequential approach, a case study is investigated. The results of tests show that integrating the concepts of uncertainties and sustainability with geographical information of the area in a two-phase sequential approach outperforms the traditional models, and leads to the creation of 262 jobs. The jobs have a high impact on the surrounding area.",A two-phase sequential approach to design bioenergy supply chains under uncertainty and social concerns,Bioenergy supply chains *** Biomass *** Decision aid *** Geographical information *** Optimization *** Social sustainability *** Sustainable development *** Uncertainty,computers and chemical engineering,85096619441,2021,1,0,0,,,
"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd As a valuable nut which is rich in minerals and vitamins, the pistachio is now popular with millions of people throughout the world. Since its major producer-exporter countries are limited, paying attention to its supply chain seems quite necessary. The pistachio SC management can play an important role in its more economic development because it involves all the activities related to the product management from supply to the customer delivery. Also, due to the recently changing environmental regulations affecting manufacturing operations, increasing attention is given to developing environmental commitments for the supply chain.

"© 2020 Elsevier B.V. The purpose of present study is twofold. Firstly, this introduces a bi-objective closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network by deliberating on farming of herbs and production plus distribution of associated herbal medicines in manufacturing-chain layer. Reverse-chain layer (RC-layer) recycles used substrates and unused herbs, thus producing biofuels and casing soil. Though majority of well-established CLSC models comprise sole pecuniary objective function, this aims to validates the economic self-reliance of RC-layer. Besides, Governments pay the subsidy to various entities, including the growers to encourage countrywide farming of herbs and the biofuels-plants for the extent of clean fuel produced. Thus, two different partners of same network earn subsidy without analysing trade-off. Secondly, this study develops an emended minmax method based interactive bi-objective optimization algorithm by employing absolute difference function and newly introduced semi-autonomized desired levels in real-life oriented T-environment. In pessimistic business scenario, whereas proposed model turns infeasible in classical interactive fuzzy multi-objective optimization algorithm, proposed algorithm determines corresponding Pareto optimal solution. In optimistic business scenario, optimal net profits to both layers of proposed model are more desirable than respective goals in proposed algorithm. Vulnerability analysis of twelve parameters to proposed model plus twelve subfigures pleads legislators to offer more subsidy to biofuels-plants and slightly lesser to growers; and to enact regulations to intensify the recycling of discarded substrates and herbs, thereby ensuring financial feasibility of RC-layer. Again, reduced subsidy to biofuels-plants and little more subsidy to growers, plus multi-angled modernization of all partners except landfills elevate the profitability of proposed network.",Cost-effective subsidy policy for growers and biofuels-plants in closed-loop supply chain of herbs and herbal medicines: An interactive bi-objective optimization in T-environment,Biofuels *** Closed-loop supply chain *** Interactive fuzzy minmax multi-objective optimization *** Marketing *** Production,applied soft computing,85097466559,2021,1,0,0,,,
"© 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. Global warming has produced negative effects in all life aspects around the world. Particularly, in terms of agriculture, the rainfall variability causes lower water availability, having unfavorable yield effects in all the crops. Temperature increases and rainfall reduction have resulting decreases in agricultural production and infertility. These issues, combined with the constant population growth, predict a severe food security problem for the next decades. In recent years, natural disasters are more frequent and dangerous as the result of global warming. Droughts, freezing, and flooding are the problems with the highest impact on the food supply chain, particularly in low-income communities, increasing the lack of access to food and undernourished problems, resulting in human casualties. This paper presents a response analysis of the food supply chain network in 14 municipalities of the state of Michoacán in Mexico; these municipalities are the ones with the lowest human development index values, joined to malnutrition problems. Natural disasters such as freezing, flood, and drought were considered and used to measure their impact on the food network through a mathematic optimization model, obtaining food system behavior to these difficulties. In the addressed case study, as a consequence of natural disasters, the total cost of the food network increases fifteen times to obtain a resilient system. The proposed approach is general, and this can be applied to other cases.",Involving Resilience in Synthesizing Food Networks in Low-Income Communities,Resilience approach *** Sustainable food supply network *** Undernourished communities *** Water-food nexus,process integration and optimization for sustainability,85093970935,2021,1,1,,,,

"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd Facility location is one of the most important strategic decisions in designing a supply chain network. However, given the interaction of strategic decisions on tactical and operational decisions, it seems necessary to provide models that integrate these decisions. In this study, a mixed-integer non-linear programming model is developed to determine the optimal pricing of products in different sales and distribution channels while integrating location-allocation decisions and inventory control of distribution centers in an uncertain environment. In order to provide a more realistic model, it is assumed that there is a correlation between demands for products, which poses a critical challenge for modeling and pricing.

"© 2020 The economic concern, environmental awareness related legislations, and potential recycling benefits are the main motives that have changed the dimension of supply chain network with environmentally effective transportation and efficient scrap collection system. This paper investigates the two echelon supply chain network of the battery manufacturing industry. This deals with an integrated optimization procedure for solving the green transportation problem and inventory problem in the first echelon, and the capacitated multi depot (Distribution center/Collection center) heterogeneous green vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery in the second echelon. The minimization of the green objective function comprising inventory carrying cost, transportation cost and carbon emission cost are considered in this work. The focus of this paper is to formulate the problem in the Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming model and to solve the four problem instances (P1 – P4) using GAMS 23.5 and Simulated Annealing Algorithm (SAA) with swap neighbourhood solution method. The experimental results show that the integrated approach with SAA provides a better solution than the sequential approach. The robustness test is carried out with four typical problem instances which show that the proposed SAA provides near optimal solutions. The model analysis is demonstrated with different components of the objective function which will help the top management to take appropriate decisions in the context of cost savings. The performance comparison reveals that the proposed SAA (SAA-1) has given better results than the Simulated Annealing Algorithm with insertion method (SAA-2).","Integrated optimization of transportation, inventory and vehicle routing with simultaneous pickup and delivery in two-echelon green supply chain network",Green transportation *** Green vehicle routing *** Inventory *** Multi period *** Pickup and delivery *** Two-echelon,journal of cleaner production,85098456504,2021,0,0,0,,,
"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd The closed-loop supply chain management (CLSCM) is an attractive research field for the corporate and academic worlds; however, closing the loop is not a simple task. Reverse logistics activities increase management complexities and uncertainties by establishing multi-fold collection and return management processes. Unlike traditional supply chain management, where managers deal with only stochastic demand, in closed-loop supply chain management, they deal with both stochastic demand and returns, which increases the cumulative uncertainty in the system. Firms usually use disposable packaging, and demand uncertainties also increase the negative environmental implications of logistics activities. This study aims to investigate optimal remanufacturing strategy and reusable packaging capacity under stochastic demand and return rate for single and multi-retailer closed-loop supply chain models. The results show that a hybrid policy is an optimal option for both single and multi-retailer cases; however, the rate of remanufacturing increases for multiple-retailers. Furthermore, remanufacturing cost, manufacturing cost, and ordering cost of retailers are the principal drivers of hybrid supply chain management. The results further suggest that supply chain managers should reduce manufacturing and remanufacturing costs because they play a central role in deciding the optimal remanufacturing rate.

"© 2021 This study proposes a data-driven analysis that describes the overall situation and reveals the factors hindering improvement in the sustainable supply chain management field. The literature has presented a summary of the evolution of sustainable supply chain management across attributes. Prior studies have evaluated different parts of the supply chain as independent entities. An integrated systematic assessment is absent in the extant literature and makes it necessary to identify potential opportunities for research direction. A hybrid of data-driven analysis, the fuzzy Delphi method, the entropy weight method and fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory is adopted to address uncertainty and complexity. This study contributes to locating the boundary of fundamental knowledge to advance future research and support practical execution. Valuable direction is provided by reviewing the existing literature to identify the critical indicators that need further examination. The results show that big data, closed-loop supply chains, industry 4.0, policy, remanufacturing, and supply chain network design are the most important indicators of future trends and disputes.

"© 2020 John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. In recent years, blockchain (BC) networks have expanded to a broad spectrum of fields. They have garnered significant attention due to their feature of creating secure private and public networks in a decentralized manner. The traditional FSC fails to meet the customer requirements of quality, safety, reliability, transparency, and traceability. This paper proposes a novel 3-stage methodology using principal component analysis (PCA), total iterative structural modeling (TISM), and Matrice d'Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée à un Classement (MICMAC) analysis to develop an integrated BC with the food supply chain (FSC). The existing literature was surveyed and industry experts' opinion was gathered and various critical success factors (CSF) were identified which are associated with FSC and BC. The data collected from experts were then evaluated for data consistency and dimension reduction through PCA. The dimensionally reduced data set was analyzed by TISM and MICMAC analysis. TISM and MICMAC analysis categorizes the enabler factors according to their hierarchical level and is used to label or distinguish between dependence and driving power. The integrated methodology found nine CSFs, namely, transparent system, fraud detect, inventory management with tracking, scalability, secure system, cost reduction, safe and quality food, customer satisfaction, and government regulations, which are the main drivers for the FSC business. The paper integrates information technology, Blockchain, with operation management, supply chain. The proposed model overcomes the limitation associated with FSC and will motivate the academia and industry to adopt and achieve efficient and effective goals in this field of FSC.",Blockchain-based efficient communication for food supply chain industry: Transparency and traceability analysis for sustainable business,blockchain *** food supply chain *** MICMAC *** PCA *** TISM,international journal of communication systems,85097271223,2021,0,0,,,,
"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd This study presents a robust multi-objective optimization model to configure a green global supply chain network structure under disruption. The proposed model is adapted to a global medical device manufacturing system. Economic and environmental issues are considered in designing the network, and mitigation strategies are employed to obtain a resilient supply chain network. To deal with the computational tractability of this non-linear and multi-objective optimization problem, a novel hybrid heuristic is developed that incorporates improved strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 (SPEA2). Computational results indicate that the proposed global supply chain network configuration can respond to its global customers’ demand in agile as well as green manner. Based on our results, the importance of the SC agility is highlighted by increasing the budget of uncertainty, and some of well-known mitigation strategies are in contradiction to the agile production paradigm.",A multi-objective optimization approach for green and resilient supply chain network design: A real-life case study,Disruptions *** Global supply chain *** Green network design *** Hybrid heuristic *** Multi-objective optimization,journal of cleaner production,85090368025,2021,,,,,,
"© 2021 Elsevier Ltd The increasing demand for a sustainable Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry has driven research domains integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM) with sustainability to gain momentum over the past years. While some studies have reviewed the development in these two domains separately, they did not address the important associations between them, nor did they analyze their joint advancement over time. Therefore, this study aims to understand and quantitatively analyze the dynamic evolution of relationships between BIM and sustainability critical towards developing BIM's functionalities to satisfy the industry's growing sustainability needs. First, 523 relevant journal articles published over the last 15 years were collected. Rule-based content analysis is then conducted on these articles using text mining to retrieve and structure relevant textual data pertaining to the six defined dimensions: BIM functionalities, software, sustainability aspects, green certification systems, project phases, and stakeholders. Social network theory is then applied to map and measure the associations between the dimensions' components for analyzing the dynamic changes in their synergies over three spans. Results reveal a significant transformation in the diversity, magnitude, and expansion of associations between BIM and sustainability domains across the supply chain. Findings also highlight less explored areas that require further research and industrial attention towards achieving full use of BIM and sustainability's integrated power. This work's novelty lies in comprehensively and quantitatively analyzing these often-dismissed synergies to reveal through knowledge-based findings how BIM has progressed to address the industry's changing sustainability requirements and recommend future directions for advancing sustainable BIM practices.",The dynamic evolution of synergies between BIM and sustainability: A text mining and network theory approach,AEC *** Building information modeling (BIM) *** Built environment *** Social network analysis *** Sustainability *** Text mining,journal of building engineering,85099231707,2021,0,0,0,,,
"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Different sources of risk factors can occur in sustainable supply chain management due to its complex nature. The telecommunication service firm cannot implement multiple improvement practices altogether to overcome the risk factors with limited resources. The industries should evalu-ate the relationship between risk factors and explore the determinants of improvement measures. The purpose of the present study is to identify and analyze critical risk factors (CRFs) for enhancing sustainable supply chain management practices in the Indian telecommunication industry using interpretive structural modelling (ISM). Risk factors are identified through a literature survey, and then with the help of experts, nine CRFs are identified using a fuzzy Delphi method (FDM). The relationship among these CRFs has been analyzed using ISM, and the driving and the dependence power of those CRFs are analyzed. Results indicate that both “government policies (laws and regulations)” and “the impact of rapid change in technology” are independent or key factors that affect the sustainability of the telecommunications supply chain. In addition, results provide significant managerial implications, including enhanced sustainability, and the government should build justice, fairness, open laws, certainties, and regulations to prevent risk in the telecommunications industry supply chain; service providers should monitor the rapidly evolving technologies and focus on technical learning and organizational capacity development to overcome the impact of technological changes. The contribution of this study is using a novel approach to establish a hierarchical structural model for an effective understanding of CRFs relationships and to explore decisive risk factors that can help telecom service providers to better plan and design effective improvement strategies to enhance sustainability supply chain management.",An exploration of the critical risk factors in sustainable telecom services: An analysis of indian telecom industries,Critical risk factors (CRFs) *** Fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) *** Interpretive structural modelling (ISM) *** Sustainability supply chain management *** Telecommunications industry,sustainability (switzerland),85099155837,0,0,0,,,,

This is evident by the business uncertainties growing in supply chain management, which pose threats to the entire network flow and economy. This paper aims to review the existing literature on risk factors in supply chain management in an uncertain and competitive business environment. Papers that contained the word “risk” in their titles, keywords, or abstracts were selected for conducting the theoretical analyses. Supply chain risk management is an integral function of the supply network. It faces unpredictable challenges due to nations’ economic policies and globalization, which have raised uncertainty and challenges for supply chain organizations. These significantly affect the financial performance of the organizations and the economy of a nation. Debate on supply chain risk management may promote competitiveness in business.

"© 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  &  Francis Group. This paper examines the relative impact on supply chain responsiveness of adding flexibility and redundancy. We seek to investigate the effectiveness of flexibility and redundancy in terms of minimising expected supply chain cost and maximizing expected service delivery when a supply chain is exposed to supplier and environmental disruptions. Compared to a supply chain that uses neither strategy and is exposed to supplier and environmental disruptions, both practices reduce expected lost sales, reduce expected total cost, and increase the expected service level. Our results show that the backup-suppliers practice is more effective than the flexible-suppliers practice, as measured by cost reduction and service-level improvement. In addition, we show that a hybrid practice created by adding some level of flexibility to a backup-suppliers practice is more desirable in terms of lowering pre-disruption investment, increasing the responsiveness of the supply chain, and lowering the expected total cost. Moreover, the result of the simulation shows that on average, the proposed stochastic model could decrease the company's total cost by 5.51%. It also shows that planning and investing in proactive demand management could decrease the company's total cost by 7.87%. Our findings provide insights into the contingencies that support implementation of each practice.",The impact of flexibility and redundancy on improving supply chain resilience to disruptions,enterprise risk management *** flexibility *** operations management *** Supply chain management *** supply network,international journal of production research,85101283402,2021,1,1,,,,
"© 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to advance the knowledge of pharmaceutical supply chain (PSC) resilience using complex adaptive system theory (CAS). Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory research design, which adopted a qualitative approach was used to achieve the study’s research objective. Qualitative data were gathered through 23 semi-structured interviews with key supply chain actors across the PSC in the UK. Findings: The findings demonstrate that CAS, as a theory, provides a systemic approach to understanding PSC resilience by taking into consideration the various elements (environment, PSC characteristics, vulnerabilities and resilience strategies) that make up the entire system. It also provides explanations for key findings, such as the impact of power, conflict and complexity in the PSC, which are influenced by the interactions between supply chain actors and as such increase its susceptibility to the negative impact of disruption. Furthermore, the antecedents for building resilience strategies were the outcome of the decision-making process referred to as co-evolution from a CAS perspective. Originality/value: Based on the data collected, the study was able to reflect on the relationships, interactions and interfaces between actors in the PSC using the CAS theory, which supports the proposition that resilience strategies can be adopted by supply chain actors to enhance this service supply chain. This is a novel empirical study of resilience across multiple levels of the PSC and as such adds valuable new knowledge about the phenomenon and the use of CAS theory as a vehicle for exploration and knowledge construction in other supply chains.",Advancing the understanding of pharmaceutical supply chain resilience using complex adaptive system (CAS) theory,Complexity *** Operations management *** Pharmaceuticals *** Resilience *** Supply chain disruptions *** Supply chain vulnerability,supply chain management,85100795594,2021,1,1,,,,
"© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC Currently, the furious competitiveness in global markets and speedy improvements in information technology lead to shorter product life cycles, lesser transportation capabilities, and increased demands as well. In most business scenarios, the supply chain network is becoming one of the most vital focusing areas. In the supply chain network, blockchain technology is a promising solution for secure information sharing. However, it is a bit critical in maintaining security at each level of the blockchain and hence the public–private–key cryptography is more commonly preferred. This study intends to construct a new privacy preservation model in the field of supply chain networks based on blockchain technology by undergoing three major phases, namely, (a) data sanitization, (b) key generation, and (c) restoration. Further, the sensitive fields in the original data are selected during the data sanitization phase, and in the key generation phase; the optimal key is generated to hide the selected sensitive fields. The hidden data with the secured key is transferred from the source (manufacturer) to destination (vendor) in the supply chain network via the blockchain. The restoration process takes place in the receiver side with the help of the same key. Among all these data flow methods, the optimal key selection is the critical issue that needs to be overridden to make the data transmission secured. As a novelty, a new optimization algorithm referred to as Whale with New Crosspoint-based Update (WNU), which is the advanced version of Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), is developed here to select the optimal key. Finally, the proposed WNU model is analyzed in terms of Hiding Failure (HF) rate, Information Preservation (IP) Rate, and False Rule generation (FR), and Degree of Modification (DM). The proposed secured information sharing in supply chain management (SCM) with blockchain technology will be validated by comparing it over the traditional models in terms of security as well.",Blockchain-based secure information sharing for supply chain management: Optimization assisted data sanitization process,blockchain *** crosspoint-based update *** data sanitization and restoration *** optimal key selection *** privacy preservation *** supply chain network,international journal of intelligent systems,85092344134,2021,0,0,,,,

"© 2021 Elsevier Ltd Blockchain technology is a revolutionary new protocol for sharing and updating information by linking ledgers or databases in a decentralised, peer-to-peer, open-access network. Blockchain is designed to ensure the data is stored and updated in a secure, tamper-proof and irreversible way. Despite being in its nascent stages, the blockchain research is developing rapidly in different fields, making it imperative to capture the ethical and sustainability implications of blockchain development and implementation. The circular economy also focuses on enhancing sustainability and social responsibility, alongside economic growth. In this article, we critically review blockchain technology's current and potential contribution to the circular economy through the lens of sustainability and social responsibility. This paper contributes to the Industry 4.0 literature by identifying, collating and organising the disparate research on blockchain, with a critical focus on its positive impact and potential repercussions for the ethics agenda. Within this narrative review, we argue and highlight the extant and potential alignment of blockchain with circular economy. Our findings show that blockchain technology can contribute to the circular economy by helping to reduce transaction costs, enhance performance and communication along the supply chain, ensure human rights protection, enhance healthcare patient confidentiality and welfare, and reduce carbon footprint. We also evaluate the challenges to blockchain implementation for circular economy, in terms of trust, illegal activities, potential for hacking and the need to address these through suitable legislation and policy development. Furthermore, we acknowledge the potential upfront costs involved in implementing blockchain technology, although we observe that the benefits are likely to exceed the challenges.

"© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC Most of the theories that have dominated supply chain management (SCM) take a reductionist and static view on the supply chain and its management, promoting a global hunt for cheap labor and resources. As a result, supply chains tend to be operated without much concern for their broader contextual environment. This perspective overlooks that supply chains have become both vulnerable and harmful systems. Recent and ongoing crises have emphasized that the structures and processes of supply chains are fluid and interwoven with political-economic and planetary phenomena. Building on panarchy theory, this article reinterprets the supply chain as a social–ecological system and leaves behind a modernist view of SCM, replacing it with a more contemporary vision of “dancing the supply chain.” A panarchy is a structure of adaptive cycles that are linked across different levels on scales of time, space, and meaning. It represents the world’s complexities more effectively than reductionist and static theories ever could, providing the basis for transformative SCM.",Dancing the Supply Chain: Toward Transformative Supply Chain Management,adaptive cycle *** dancing *** panarchy *** social–ecological resilience *** social–ecological system *** transformative management,journal of supply chain management,85097294475,2021,0,0,,,,
"© 2013 IEEE. Increasing global warming, climate change and stringent governmental legislations are driving industry practitioners and decision makers to implement various strategies to reduce carbon emissions. One of the effective approaches to mitigate carbon emissions is the implementation of closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). The key motivation for considering multiple recovery options in the CLSC is to capture the remaining economic value and to reduce carbon emissions in the collection and recovery operations. Customer's willingness to return used product depends on the acquisition price and nearness to the collection center. This research proposes a deterministic mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for a multi-period and multi-product CLSC network under carbon pricing and carbon trading policies consideration. The model includes different acquisition price for returned products and multiple recovery options. Further, the study takes into consideration uncertainty in procurement cost, demand, and quantity of returned products. A robust optimization approach is adopted to address uncertainty in network parameters. Numerical results show that the proposed model captures trade-offs between total cost and carbon emission. Overall, the study reveals that the carbon trading policy incurs relatively lower total cost compared to the carbon pricing policy. Repair and recycling activities in the reverse supply chain contribute significantly to the total cost and carbon emission. This study provide evidence that it is possible to achieve an optimal CLSC network with reduced carbon emission at a moderate total supply chain cost. The proposed model could be used to guide firms to choose an appropriate budget of uncertainty toward achieving a robust supply chain network.",Robust Design of a Closed-Loop Supply Chain Considering Multiple Recovery Options and Carbon Policies under Uncertainty,carbon policies *** closed-loop supply chain *** mixed-integer linear programming *** multi recovery options *** reverse logistics *** robust optimization *** Sustainable manufacturing *** uncertainty,ieee access,85098748157,2021,0,0,0,,,
"© 2021 Taylor  &  Francis Group, LLC. Risk mitigation strategies have an environmental effect besides their economic benefits. The current research investigates designing a green-resilient supply chain network under the risk of disruptions. A new risk mitigation strategy namely “coalition” is applied between suppliers in a bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model to minimize total cost and carbon emissions, simultaneously. Along with the coalition strategy between suppliers, the multi-sourcing strategy in the downstream supply chain is applied for retailers. The performance of the coalition strategy is compared with the three reputable risk mitigation strategies in both single-source and multi-source retailers. Results revealed that the average total cost and total carbon emissions of the green-resilient model have been reduced by 14% and 3.6% compared to the non-resilient model, respectively. Besides, multiple-sourcing for retailers has no improvement in the non-resilient model. On the contrary, the economic and environmental performance of the resilient model varies for the different number of sources.",Suppliers’ coalition strategy for green-Resilient supply chain network design,coalition *** dairy *** disruption *** Green-resilient supply chain *** multiple sourcing,journal of industrial and production engineering,85101211943,2021,1,1,1,,,
"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd Perishable products require special handling measures that may have social and environmental impacts along with their well-known economic aspects. Therefore, the sustainability of food supply chains has gained ground; however, the sustainability of perishable food supply chains, is still not a fully explored field of study. Therefore, in this research, a multi-objective mathematical programming model is developed to optimize the cost, energy consumption, and the traffic congestion associated with such supply chain operations. In this study, product lifetime uncertainty is explicitly modeled as a Weibull random variable, and food perishability is assumed to be affected by vehicle refrigerator utilization, which is considered as a decision variable. In addition, multiple vehicle types and multiple product types are considered. A dairy supply chain case is investigated, and the interrelations and interactions of all three aspects of sustainability, also known as the three triple bottom lines (TBL) of sustainability, are studied. The results indicate that emphasizing the economic aspect, for highly perishable products, the environmental impact of the chain may increase by 120%, and for the highly congested road networks, the social impact may rise by 51%. However, a 15% economic compromise can improve the sustainability of the supply chain network design by 150%. It is also shown that road congestion and the uncertain perishability of the products are critical factors that can, although differently, affect the operation and the design of the supply chain.

"Sustainable supplier selection is one of the most critical activities for establishing an effective sustainable supply chain and is typically a multi-criteria decision-making problem. One of the important ways for evaluating sustainable suppliers is to use data envelopment analysis (DEA) models. There are many DEA models for ranking decision making units (DMUs) that are applicable for selecting the best sustainable suppliers. This paper presents a new DEA model for ranking DMUs (suppliers) based on a modification of context-dependent DEA models. Using the concept of attractiveness and progress for each supplier, this paper suggests a new DEA ranking approach. The proposed method is able to rank all efficient and inefficient suppliers.

"Purpose This paper aims to assess and prioritize manufacturing companies in the healthcare industry based on critical success factors (CSFs) of their reverse logistics (RL). The research involves seven medical device companies located in the Tehran Province, Iran. Design/methodology/approach To identify and prioritize companies based on CSFs of RL, the study proposes a three-phase decision-making framework that integrates the Delphi method, the best-worst method (BWM) and the Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS) method with Z-numbers. The weights required for this method are obtained by a variant of the BWM based on Z-numbers, denoted as Z-numbers Best-Worst Method, or ZBWM. Since decision-makers face an uncertain environment, Z-numbers, which are a kind of fuzzy numbers, are applied. Findings First, after customizing CSFs by the Delphi method and obtaining 15 CSFs of RL, these are ranked by the hybrid BWM-ARAS method with Z-numbers. Results reveal which company appears to perform best with respect to their RL implementations.

"Companies with a high-performing supply chain (SC) often exhibit superior business performance. Therefore, companies are increasingly aligning their supply chain with business goals due to their impact on the firm's performance. Researchers acknowledge the importance of managing supply chain performance (SCP) in achieving greater customer experience and retention, increased cost-competitiveness, gaining market share with faster product innovation. Hence measuring and managing SCP is critical for a firm's business success. Though existing literature has explored key performance indicators (KPI) in measuring SCP but has rarely studied the interactions among the key SCP metrics and subsequent impact of overall SCP. To address the gap, present research work aimed to identify key metrics, rank them, investigate mutual relationship and propose integrated SCP metrics. Understanding the interrelationship among SCP metrics will enable supply chain practitioners in well-aligned decision making. To achieve this, a hybrid exploratory three-phased multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) model is adopted. The qualitative Delphi technique is initially applied to identify the critical SCP metrics, followed by Best-Worst Method (BWM) to rank SCP metrics, completed by decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method to establish the mutual relationship among the SCP metrics. The research finding, based on the study conducted for mining and earth-moving machinery manufacturing industry, suggests that sub-metrics such as flexibility in meeting customer needs, customer perceived value, operating cost of SC, employee productivity, range of products and services, are significantly contributing to the overall SCP.

"Sustainable development is critical to cold chain logistics, including its economic, environmental, and social effects, especially in road transportation. To simultaneously address these issues, we propose a comprehensive cold-chain-based low-carbon location-routing-problem optimization model to minimize the total logistics costs and client and vehicle waiting time. The first objective comprises the fixed costs of depots to open and vehicles to rent, vehicle renting cost, driver salaries, fuel consumption cost, carbon emission costs, and damage costs of cargos that need to be refrigerated or frozen. The second objective consists of the waiting time of clients and vehicles to improve client satisfaction and the efficiency of the cold chain logistics network. In the proposed problem, we developed a strategy for improving the efficiency of the cold chain logistics network by mixing the types of cargos arranged in one vehicle. Aiming at efficiently solving the proposed model, six well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) were used by combining an efficient framework, and first (FI) and best-improvement (BI) search mechanisms were considered. In the experiments, we examined the effectiveness of six MOEAs inserting the proposed framework and search mechanisms, and the result showed that NSGA-II/FI, SPEA2/FI, and NSGA-II/BI were the top three MOEAs. In the extensive experiments, the results showed that the delivery strategy, depot cost, depot capacity, crowding distance, and traveling speed have significant effects on the Pareto front, fuel consumption, carbon emission, vehicle and client waiting times, traveling distance, and traveling time.

"Lean Manufacturing is always important for process improvement in manufacturing industries especially in deem of adoption but the implementation of simple lean is not enough to attain required results. A recent trend has been observed regarding the implementation of strategies like Lean, Agile, Resilient and Green (LARG) in combination to attain fruitful results. However, this combination carries a complication regarding its understanding and implementation and a gap observed regarding the availability of literature study that can cope all these strategies on one platform for understanding and can suggest a proper implementation method. It has been observed that there are some new models that are utilizing electronic configurations to provide powerful platform for process improvements. Utilization of LARG as tool or technique in combination of technologies can be very effective for process improvements. Therefore, this current work emphasis on the combining of LARG along with wireless technologies for obtaining a sustainable improvement in manufacturing sector, which seems unavailable. Based on this ideology, the aim of this research is to conduct a systematic literature study that reviews the previously available LARG research with the objectives to first study the LARG combination for understanding and to develop the interrelation between LARG and previous available technologies for its successful implementation. The literature study results that the LARG combination has many benefits like helpful to attain elimination of non-value activities (lean), responsive to the changing demands of customers as per increasing volatile market (agile), responsive to the unexpected disruptions (resilient) and to adopt environmental protection (green) but typically lacks its utilization with modern technologies (Like RFID) that will be helpful to attain successful implementation.

"The industrial symbiosis initiative, which aims to reuse waste resources, is considered as a potential solution for sustainable manufacturing. Compared with much literature for the industrial symbiosis optimization about waste energy and wastewater, this paper proposes an industrial symbiosis optimization model based on the waste material recycling and exchanging network. By-products from the production process are considered the main components of waste material flows. A Mixed-integer programming method is employed to formulate the optimization model. In response to the three pillars of sustainability, three sub-objectives, namely the economy, environment, and society, are built for the proposed optimization model. The Epsilon-constraint technology is established to tackle the multiobjective model efficiently. Decisions on waste material recycling and exchanging flow are formulated in the proposed model, as well as options on reprocessing sites and reprocessing technology levels. The results show that the proposed Mixed-Inter Programming optimization method and Epsilon-constraint technology are sufficient to obtain the solutions of industrial symbiosis optimization. Technology level decisions integrated into the optimization model can balance the objectives of economy, environment, and society and provide a more extensive decision option space for managers. Raw material price and by-product recycling cost are two main elements of the waste material exchanging of industrial symbiosis optimization based on the parameter robustness analysis. Multi-objective optimization of waste material reprocessing and exchange network allows managers to make decisions based on different objective priorities. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

"The ever-increasing energy demand and harmful environmental and social impacts instigated by fossil fuels have led to the development of sustainable energy resources. Biodiesel has been introduced as an alternative owing to its wide commercial applications. It can be produced from various types of biomass including vegetable oil, used cooking oil, and animal fat. Of these, animal fat is a promising option because of its low cost and easy availability. For a speedy transition toward large-scale commercially viable biodiesel production, the efficient design of a biodiesel supply chain is very important. Moreover, because biodiesel supply chain (SC) design decisions directly influence social and environmental aspects, hence SC optimization within the sustainability paradigm is necessary. This research proposes a waste-animal-fat-based biodiesel SC optimization model that minimizes environmental impact and SC cost while maximizing social wellbeing. The complex and dynamic environment of biodiesel production brings a high level of uncertainty, which compromises the effectiveness of SC decisions; thus, a modified robust possibilistic chance-constrained programming solution methodology is developed. To validate the proposed model and solution methodology, a computational analysis of a case study is performed. The results demonstrate that by paying 1.13% higher costs, a desirable level of social and environmental protection can be achieved for the proposed supply chain. It is also found that with an increase of 5% in the economic objective, 6% increase in the environmental objective, and 7% decrease in the social objective, the risk of epistemic uncertainty can be completely ruled out. Further, from the numerical analysis it is inferred that among all tiers of biodiesel SC, the decisions of the biorefinery tier play a crucial role in achieving sustainable development goals. Furthermore, a higher priority of economic and environmental objectives makes the SC decisions more centralized, whereas a higher priority of the social objective makes them more decentralized. The proposed model can be useful to investors and policymakers involved in biodiesel production and distribution.",Management of animal fat-based biodiesel supply chain under the paradigm of sustainability,Waste animal fat *** Non-edible feedstock *** Sustainable biodiesel supply chain *** Robust possibilistic programming *** Social responsibility,energy conversion and management,WOS:000603328100001,2020,0,0,,,,
"Green agri-food supply chains are increasingly attracting research interest, owing to their potential capacity for resilience against recent crises (e.g., financial, COVID-19) as well as end-consumers' concerns on sustainability issues. In this context, this paper aims to explore the relationship between green supply chain management practices and three different performance aspects, namely, supply chain, green (environmental) and business performance, and controlling for environmental dynamism. Field research was conducted through a structured questionnaire contacted to 134 executives of firms in the agri-food sector in Greece. The results reveal that information sharing, logistics networking and transportation are the most powerful factors that impact sustainable, business and supply chain performance. In addition, green packaging is related to financial and social performance aspects. Interestingly, green warehousing and logistics emissions failed to establish any relationship with performance outcomes. The conclusions and recommendations drawn in the present study are expected to provide meaningful guidance for the supply chain decision-making process, as logistics managers are becoming increasingly aware of exploiting all available resources, knowhow and competitive advantages for attaining sustainable performance.",Implications of Green Logistics Management on Sustainable Business and Supply Chain Performance: Evidence from a Survey in the Greek Agri-Food Sector,green supply chain management *** green logistics management *** sustainability *** green performance *** business performance,sustainability,WOS:000603201200001,2020,0,0,0,,,
"An absence of trust among partners can magnify the risk in a complex project by increasing behavioural uncertainty. Partnership trust can effectively substitute for control, reducing variability of outcomes and increasing value-adding strategic collaboration. It is introduced as strategic countermeasures against risks associated with project complexity that can only be achieved with commitment from all partners. This research conceptualises partnership trust on four dimensions and investigates the roles of dedicated investment and information sharing in partnership trust-commitment.

"Increasingly, creating and delivering value through complex supply chain networks involves substantial risks. However, strategy development under business risk conditions is not well-understood. This cross-country research examines how, under conditions of supply chain network risk, firms develop effective risk management practices. Using a literature review and survey research of managers from global firms; we present a research model, and empirically test the hypothesized relationships. The results show that under conditions of uncertainty, management decision-making is more likely to be cautious until visible forms of risks emerge, and prudent response mechanisms are put in place. This study identifies the crucial role of supply chain exploration and exploitation practices, and their influence in development of network risk management practices, leading to competitive financial outcomes.

"Currently, ways to approach the design of Cyber Physical Systems in Industry 4.0 are under development. Emerging concepts of Smart Factories require the development of specialized knowledge; new working methods are also needed to manage the transition from conventional industry to industry 4.0. To achieve this objective, fractal theory could provide the appropriate knowledge and tools. Fractal systems applied to manufacturing have been widely used over the last decades to design complex adaptive systems: it allows the introduction of resilience requirements (capacity to react to changes in a turbulent environment) and to reduce the complexity of its structure, operation and management. In order to know the potential and the possibility of applying fractal theory to the design of systems in Industry 4.0, this article reviews the publications that develop fractal systems for manufacturing engineering. The review includes contributions published between 1985 (approximate date of the first works on the theory applied to manufacturing engineering) and 2019. The objective is to gather those strategies, methodologies and successful case studies that can be useful for the approaches of Industry 4.0 and to define a set of future lines of work for the adaptation of the fractal theory to the new challenges posed by Industry 4.0.",Analysis of fractal manufacturing systems framework towards industry 4.0,Fractal manufacturing *** Industry 4.0 *** Complexity *** Smart factory *** Cyber-physical system *** Project management,journal of manufacturing systems,WOS:000598179200004,2020,0,0,0,,,
"Today, an increase in the drought and water shortage all around the world is a challengeable threat for different governments and international committees. Water supply chain aims to manage the water consumption and to control the water shortage. Contrary to most of previous studies focused on the forward directions of the water supply chain, this paper also considers the reverse logistics known as a Closed-Loop Supply Chain (CLSC). Hence, an integrated Water Supply and Wastewater Collection System (WSWCS) under uncertainty is proposed. Furthermore, regarding the trend of sustainable development, the environmental dimensions and social benefits of the integrated WSWCS are contributed. To meet the standards of the sustainable development in developing countries, a case study in Iran is applied to a novel multi-objective stochastic optimization model based on triple bottom lines of sustainability. Having already been employed to similar optimization problems, the Social Engineering Optimizer (SEO) has been never applied in this research area. Another innovation of this study is to introduce an improved multi-objective SEO to solve this complicated model. Eventually, with regards to an extensive comparison contributing to the Pareto-based metrics and different sensitivities, some managerial implications are concluded as the main findings.",Sustainable closed-loop supply chain network for an integrated water supply and wastewater collection system under uncertainty,Sustainable development *** Water supply chain *** Closed-loop supply chain *** Water supply and wastewater collection system *** Multi-objective stochastic optimization model *** Social engineering optimizer,journal of environmental management,WOS:000582474500047,2020,0,0,,,,
"With the increasing demands on businesses to operate more sustainably, firms must ensure that the performance of their whole supply chain in sustainability is optimized. Because partner selection is critical to supply chain management, focal firms now need to select supply chains partners that can offer a high level of competence in sustainability. This paper proposes a novel multi-partner classification model for the partner qualification and classification process, combining ensemble learning technology and fuzzy set theory. The proposed model enables potential partners to be classified into one of four categories (strategic partner, preference partner, leverage partner and routine partner), thereby allowing distinctive partner management strategies to be applied for each category. The model provides for the simultaneous optimization of both efficiency in its use of multi-partner and multi-dimension evaluation data, and effectiveness in dealing with the vagueness and uncertainty of linguistic commentary data, in the partner evaluation process. Compared to more conventional methods, the proposed model has the advantage of offering a simple classification and a stable prediction performance. The practical efficacy of the model is illustrated by an application in a listed electronic equipment and instrument manufacturing company based in southeastern China. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

"This study was conducted aimed at providing a sustainable multi-objective model of supply chain location, inventory, routing under uncertainty with a passive defense approach, in which the Upgral model was first introduced to the world. The Upgral Paradigm is an integrated model for the location-inventory-routing problem in a four-level supply chain where parameters such as demand, facility cost and inventory costs are taken into account uncertain as triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs). In this study, the characteristics and capabilities of passive defense in the supply chain, such as logistical flow rate, backup path security, the possibility of resource and equipment deployment, and the dispersion principle were considered for location to increase the resilience of supply chain. The model was solved using Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and NSGA-II meta-heuristic algorithm. First, a four-objective mathematical model was proposed for the problem the objectives of which were: 1) minimizing supply chain costs; 2) maximizing social responsibility or social benefits; 3) minimizing environmental impacts; and 4) minimizing risk. Moreover, the experimental sample problems were solved in three small, medium, and large groups using the WOA Algorithm. The results of solving this algorithm were compared with the results of NSGA-II one according to the indices including quality, dispersion, uniformity and solution time indices to prove the efficiency of the algorithm. Based on the results, the WOA algorithm had a higher ability to achieve higher quality and near-optimal solutions than NSGA-II algorithm in all cases. The dispersion index values indicated that the WOA Algorithm performed better in exploring and extracting the feasible region. In addition, with respect to the results of the uniformity and the solution time indices, it was found that the NSGA-II Algorithm had a lower solution time than the WOA Algorithm and the answer space more uniformly.",Providing an Integrated Multi-Objective Model for Closed-Loop Supply Chain under Fuzzy Conditions with Upgral Approach,closed-loop supply chain *** sustainability *** passive defense *** uncertainty *** meta-heuristic algorithm,international journal of nonlinear analysis and applications,WOS:000566789000011,2020,1,1,,,,
"The semiconductor industry is constantly striving to improve the performance, reliability, and cost of electronic devices. The growing complexity in the design process of microelectronics coupled with the requirement of significant investment in research and development means that there is hardly any entity in the industry that is capable of acquiring the state-of-the-art technologies for all facets of the development process across myriad niche device technologies. Therefore, for economic and practical reasons, the modern electronic supply chain relies on several different vendors that specialize in a specific area of the design and fabrication process. From a security perspective, this distributed manufacturing process violates the trust of the underlying hardware as any entity in the supply chain could maliciously modify the design. This poses a significant concern, especially for government, military applications, and consumer electronic products handling private and critical data during the acquisition of untrusted microelectronic designs and components. Hence, trust has emerged as a crucial constraint that the various steps in the microelectronic manufacturing process should consider in order to ensure that no malicious functionality exists in the hardware. In the last decade, several works have proposed steps both to establish and verify trust in microelectronics. However, not all threat models are adequately covered, and the solutions are pertinent to a limited category of devices. In this article, we present the challenges in establishing trust in today's distributed supply chain environment by discussing the attack models at each step of the manufacturing process. We also shed light on the existing solutions that try to address these threats and discuss their limitations. Finally, we elaborate on one of the existing supply chain standards where trust verification is still infeasible and identify avenues for future research.",Trust Issues in Microelectronics: The Concerns and the Countermeasures,Trojan horses *** Integrated circuits *** Hardware *** Microelectronics *** Supply chains *** Fabrication *** Logic gates,ieee consumer electronics magazine,WOS:000576418800012,2020,0,0,,,,
"Trends like globalization, shorter product life-cycles, and cost reduction strategies in the global business environment have exposed many supply chains to various risks. Disruptions are one of the supply chain risks that can interrupt product flow, delay customer deliveries, and reduce supply chain revenues considerably. Prior planning for disruptions could greatly alleviate these consequences. A method to cope with disruptions is to use product substitution in the case of a product shortage. In this research, the supply chain of a livestock-drug distribution company in Iran, facing demand disruptions, has been chosen as a case study. For this purpose, a multi-stage stochastic integer programming model is proposed and solved using a customized progressive hedging algorithm. Moreover, the effect of uncertainty on the supply chain performance is measured using the value of the stochastic solution (VSS) and the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) metrics. Based on the different instances of the problem solved, the VSS metric shows that modeling and solving the proposed stochastic model could enhance the company profit by about 3.27 percent on average. In addition, the EVPI metric demonstrates that planning and investing in proactive demand management could enhance the profit up to 9.42 percent. Finally, analyses indicate that when dealing with increased demand uncertainty levels, the importance of using the proposed method increases as the profitability of the company decreases.",A multi-stage stochastic programming approach for supply chain risk mitigation via product substitution,Supply chain *** Disruption *** Multi-stage stochastic integer programming *** Progressive hedging algorithm,computers & industrial engineering,WOS:000582320000033,2020,0,0,0,,,
"This research addresses the integrated lot-sizing and scheduling problem with complex setup structure in which the required raw materials are hazardous and the inherent risk of hazardous materials (HAZMATs) in case of incidents leads to disruptions and dangerous consequences for the environment and human beings. This paper proposes a reliable model based on mixed-integer programming (MIP) in which the purchasing lot-sizing with all-unit discount and multiple transportation modes, production lot-sizing and scheduling are achieved simultaneously while these decisions are made independently in traditional environments. First, this research examines the maximizing profit with demand choice flexibility in a trade-off with minimizing risk of HAZMAT incidents. Then, the stochastic model with uncertain demand is extended applying the Chance-Constrained Programming (CCP) approach and the results are compared using various datasets. Examinations denote that examples of reasonable sizes in different conditions can be solved in a few seconds. Results show that the deterministic model with demand choice flexibility has a better computational performance than the stochastic model with stochastic demand, but the quality of the stochastic model's solutions is higher than the other one over the various utilization levels of production lines. Based on the results, with increasing the level of utilization, the total profit decreases, and the total risk increases. Furthermore, the results also prove the impact of discount structure on production and purchasing quantities, revenues, costs, and risks. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

"With the recent emphasis on sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) by both companies, consumers and governments, selecting eco-economic partners is more important than ever. Multiple aspects play critical roles in partner selection, including so many social, environmental, and economic attributes, but considering all of them simultaneously has proved impossible due to limitations in terms of evaluating resources and efficient decision making. Hence, a crucial first step of partner selection in an SSCM context is to decide which criteria to focus on and which to disregard. However, previous literature on partner selection usually treat the establishment of criteria as a given, and also neglect the interrelationships between them. To bridge this research gap, the present study develops a systematic four-stage optimization model for constructing partner selection criteria, based on Dempster-Shafer theory, the improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method. Our model integrates quantitative and qualitative methodologies to identify, group, filter, and analyze potential alternative criteria for partner selection in sustainable supply chains. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed approach with a case study of a Chinese electronic and equipment manufacturer. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

"The provision of essential supplies is a key service provided by retailers when demand spikes due to consumer stockpiling during environmental emergencies. Moreover, it is important for retailers to quickly recover from these events by replenishing the stock of essential supplies to meet the continuing needs of local residents. The main purpose of this research is to study consumer precautionary stockpiling behavior prior to the onset of hurricane landfalls and determine the impact of this behavior on in-store product availability for various formats of retail store outlets. Specifically, we focus on the bottled water product category, an essential emergency category in hurricane preparedness. This study combines an event analysis methodology with econometric models using archival retail scanner data from 60 US retail chains located in 963 counties and real-time data from four recent US continental hurricanes. We find that supply-side characteristics (retail network and product variety), demand-side characteristics (hurricane experience and household income), and disaster characteristics (hazard proximity and hazard intensity) significantly affect consumer stockpiling propensity as the hurricanes approach. The increased consumer stockpiling has immediate and longer-term impacts on retail operations, namely, in-store product availability. Among various retail formats, drug stores are associated with the highest consumer stockpiling propensity before hurricanes, while dollar stores and discount stores are associated with the lowest in-store product availability following hurricanes. Our study points to the need for retailers and policymakers to carefully monitor factors affecting consumer stockpiling behavior that will allow for better allocation of critical supplies during the hurricane season.",Pre-Hurricane Consumer Stockpiling and Post-Hurricane Product Availability: Empirical Evidence from Natural Experiments,product availability *** consumer stockpiling *** hurricane disasters *** natural experiment,production and operations management,WOS:000577584400008,2020,0,0,0,,,
"The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) practices on triple bottom line (TBL) measures from the perspective of organizational theories. This study identified five SSCM practices using a comprehensive literature review and feedback from industry experts. These five practices were prioritized using a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP). The results from FAHP analysis were further confirmed by conducting semi-structured interviews in five electronics parts/components manufacturing organizations. This study also prioritized theoretical drivers of SSCM adoption based on the consideration of three organizational theory perspectives - Institutional Theory; Resource-Based View, and; Social Network Theory. The results indicate that the economic dimension was the most important measure for implementing SSCM while sustainable design was the most important SSCM practice for achieving the TBL. The study also found that Institutional Theory is the most important theoretical driver for implementing SSCM.

"Way back the development of Blockchain (BC) technology, Traditional supply chain (TSC) failed to meet the demand of customer of reasonable price with high quality. The current trend is the time to integrate and to make the existing system smarter, automated and sustainable. Researchers are working on the integration of information and communication technology with the supply chain (SC) and continuously endeavor to achieve an efficient SC. This paper is an attempt to study the use of BC technology and a try to develop efficient sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) rather than the inefficient design of supply chain management (SCM). Important variables related to BC are identified from the literature after going through discussion with academician and industry experts. These variables are further analyzed and modeled using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Fuzzy-Decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL). PCA is applied to form the principal factor from these identified variables based on possible correlation. Although, the application of Fuzzy-DEMATEL is adopted to identify major causes that help to achieve sustainable supply chain (SSC) after integration of BC technology. The proposed integrated (incorporated) approach of PCA and Fuzzy-DEMATEL found six major causes namely Data safety and Decentralization, Accessibility, Laws and Policy, Documentation, Data management, and Quality. This study is revolving around the integrated approach of two streams namely BC-related Information technology and SC from Operations. This research represents the significant role of causes, which leads to the integration of BC with the SC resulting in achieving sustainability.

"Resilience has become a crucial topic in the field of strategic management as it requires companies to design resilient business models to tackle managerial and environmental disruptions of individual firms and supply chains. However, extant research still lacks deep insights into how companies design and manage supply chains according to the resilience principles. With this premise, this paper aims at conducting a state of the art review on supply chain resilience (SCR) considering 125 relevant papers collected from Scopus and Web of Science academic search engine. Starting from the results of the literature review, this study proposes a systemic framework of SCR assessment and contributes to improve the understanding of the impact of different empirically tested constructs on the development of the resilience concept. Further, the findings are summarized in several areas including barriers in developing resilience, metrics to measure the resilience performance, and effective strategies to foster the SCR.

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Photovoltaic Solar Energy (PSE) sector has sparked great interest from governments over the last decade towards diminution of world’s dependency to fossil fuels, greenhouse gas emissions reduction and global warming mitigation. Photovoltaic solar energy also holds a significant role in the transition to sustainable energy systems. These systems and their optimal exploitation require an effective supply chain management system, such as design of the network, collection, storage, or transportation of this energy resource, without disregarding a country’s certain socio-economic and political conditions. In Brazil, the adoption of photovoltaic solar energy has been motivated not only by the energy matrix diversification but also from the shortages, problems, and barriers that the Brazilian energy sector has faced, lately. However, PSE development is affected by various factors with high uncertainty, such as political, social, economic, and environmental, that include critical operational sustainability issues. Thus, an elaborate modelling of energy management and a well-structured decision support process are needed to enhance the performance efficiency of Brazilian PSE supply chain management. This study focuses on the investigation of certain factors and their influence on the development of the Brazilian PSE with the help of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps. Fuzzy Cognitive Map is an established methodology for scenario analysis and management in diverse domains, inheriting the advancements of fuzzy logic and neural networks. In this context, a semi-quantitative model was designed with the help of various stakeholders from the specific energy domain and three plausible scenarios were conducted in order to support a decision-making process on PSE sector development and the country’s economic potential. The outcome of this analysis reveals that the development of the PSE sector in Brazil is mainly affected by economic and political factors.",Decision-making process for photovoltaic solar energy sector development using fuzzy cognitive map technique,Decision-support *** Energy management *** Fuzzy Cognitive Maps *** Photovoltaic solar energy *** Scenario analysis,energies,85082664850,2020,0,0,0,,,
"© Firenze University Press. There is a growing scientific interest and public debate on the potential contributions that Local Food Systems (LFS) and Short Food Supply Chains (SFSCs) can make towards overcoming sustainability challenges and creating societal impact. In the case of Turkey, where local agricultural systems are particularly vulnerable, lacking of resilience and innovative capacity, understanding the governance mechanisms of SFSCs would have strong implications for policy making. To this end, our aim in this study is to explore the mechanisms through which civil society driven SFSCs are governed in the city of Izmir (Turkey), referring to the actors involved in the process, institutional frameworks that are adopted and challenges experienced, that could inform policy discussions towards establishing more sustainable local food systems. In this direction, the questions we aim to answer are: (1) what are the mechanisms through which community level SFSCs are initiated and governed, (2) how collaboration takes place within these groups and through which processes, and finally (3) what the outcomes of these processes are, with respect to individual, community and local impacts experienced on the ground, and challenges associated with them. We use a descriptive case study methodology, to study seven SFSC initiatives (four food community networks, two farmers’ markets and a local shop) in the city of Izmir; and collect data through qualitative semi-structured in-depth interviews (41 with producers, 32 with consumers, 11 with coordinators and 5 with experts). Our findings suggest that different mechanisms are at play within our cases, depending on aspects including their governing structures and their way and purpose of operation. While farmers had difficulties relying solely on their income from these initiatives for their livelihoods, organizational challenges experienced by food communities were mainly related to difficulties associated to managing tasks on a voluntary basis. Moreover, arriving at a shared understanding about mutual goals, in addition to finding a way to include stakeholders in the process, were among the most prevalent challenges of all initiatives.","Exploring governance mechanisms, collaborative processes and main challenges in short food supply chains: The case of turkey",Alternative food networks *** Collaborative governance *** Governance challenges *** Local food systems *** Short food supply chains,bio-based and applied economics,85101324560,2020,0,0,0,,,
"© 2020 COVID-19 has imposed significant detrimental effects on the global hospitality sector. These effects have primarily been considered from the socio-economic perspective, ignoring the implications of the pandemic for the environmental performance of hospitality services. By drawing upon emerging evidence from various academic and non-academic sources, this conceptual paper critically evaluates the implications of the preventative and protective measures adopted against COVID-19 for the generation of the hospitality sector's food and plastic waste. The implications are divided into direct and indirect and considered through the prism of temporality of their anticipated occurrence (immediate, short-term and medium-term perspective). The paper proposes potential strategies to aid in the management of these wastes in the hospitality sector in a post-pandemic world. To address the issue of food waste, the hospitality sector should be integrated into alternative food networks (AFNs) and short food supply chains (SFSCs). Business coopetition between hospitality enterprises and other actors of the food supply chain is necessary for the success of such integration. To address the issue of plastic waste, the hospitality sector should invest in ‘green’ innovation. This investment needs to be encouraged and supported by targeted policy interventions. The paper argues that these strategies are critical not only in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, but will also remain valid for the sustained development of the hospitality sector in light of future disastrous events, especially climate change. The paper discusses the institutional and organisational prerequisites for the effective implementation of these strategies and highlights the related research opportunities.",The prospects of waste management in the hospitality sector post COVID-19,Business coopetition *** COVID-19 pandemic *** Food waste *** Plastic waste *** Solid waste *** ‘Green’ innovation,"resources, conservation and recycling",85096117414,2020,0,0,0,,,

"© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: Humanitarian supply chain (HSC) has been constantly challenged with multiple issues due to the complex dynamics of the disaster. These issues are inevitable and interrelated. The issues produce undesirable cascading effects that make performance measurement complicated. This paper aims to identify and model the critical barriers in the HSC. Design/methodology/approach: The study identifies 17 barriers through the relevant literature and interviews with the stakeholders related to humanitarian organization (HO) in the developing economy. The barriers have been identified from strategic, technological, organizational, economic and operational point of view. Further, the barriers were ranked based on the degree of influence using the grey analytic network process (ANP) approach. The interrelationship among the influential barriers is established through modified total interpretive structural modelling (mTISM). To analyse and demonstrate the iterative consensus among the stakeholders, kappa statistics was adopted. Findings: The barriers have been ranked to determine their extent of influence and modelled to reveal the interrelationship among them. The issues concerned with skills of personnel are the most influential barrier. Other three critical barriers identified are: chaotic operative environment, conflicting objectives of HO and lack of funding for information technology (IT) infrastructure. Appropriate funds need to be allocated towards IT infrastructure and personnel training. Originality/value: Both quantitative and qualitative performance measurement frameworks had been proposed earlier for HSC. However, limited literature addresses the implementation issues with the available frameworks. This study advances the knowledge on performance measurement barriers of HSC and develops a functional description to identify the critical role of performance measurement in HOs. The study proposes a new version of the interpretive structure modelling, using mTISM technique, to determine the contextual interactions between various HSC performance measurement barriers.",Modelling performance measurement barriers of humanitarian supply chain,Grey system theory (GST) *** Humanitarian organization *** Humanitarian supply chain *** Multi-criteria decision modelling (MCDM) *** Performance measurement,international journal of productivity and performance management,85092485657,2020,0,0,0,,,
"© 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. This paper seeks to develop a reliable network of cross-docks by taking in to account disruption and reliability issues to hedge against heterogeneous risk of cross-docking failure. In real environments, applying a recovery policy can be a feasible strategy to handle disruptions. Hence, in this study, a recovery policy has been addressed in the form of reallocating suppliers to alternative cross-docks or altering the transportation strategy to move shipments. In addition to cross-dock location design, the optimum capacity of opened cross-docks will be determined considering the loads that will be served by each cross-docking center under regular and disruption conditions. A mixed integer nonlinear programming formulation is presented for the problem and is then linearized to present an efficient model. In order to solve it, two Lagrangian relaxation algorithms are designed and tested on 40 problem instances with different values of parameters. The results achieved by GAMS/CPLEX are compared with those of two algorithms and some analyses are performed on the solutions. Moreover, as the case study, the focus has been placed on logistic part of a car-manufacturing company with a vast supply chain network, containing more than 600 suppliers. The logistic strategies have been applied in order to reduce the transportation cost through the supply chain network and diminish the disruption subsequences in such a network.

"© 2020, TU Delft. All rights reserved. Prolonged periods of drought affect river discharges and cause water levels and available water depth to drop for extended periods of time. Low water depth has a major impact on the loading capacity of inland ships, and as a consequence on the transport capacity of the overall waterborne supply chain. Individual ship owners have detailed knowledge on how much the draught of their ship and the associated cargo weight should be reduced to adapt to low water. These parameters are even adjusted as a function of environmental circumstances (e.g. composition of the riverbed) and type of cargo. This detailed knowledge is, however, not accessible at an aggregated level to assess the effects on the overall transport capacity of an inland waterway transport network. Based on a range of field observations and information collected from individual ships, this article introduces a general model to define the effect of low water constraints on the deadweight and payload of inland ships, for which only the type, length, and beam of the vessel serve as mandatory input. Availability of a general model of the capacity reducing effect of lowered water depth is important for the design and operation of robust transport chains on the one hand, and for the optimisation of fairway maintenance and long-term infrastructure development on the other.",The effect of low water on loading capacity of inland ships,Deadweight *** Draft *** Inland shipping *** Payload *** Water depth,european journal of transport and infrastructure research,85091336396,2020,0,0,0,,,
"© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: Cold supply chain (CSC) distribution systems are vital in preserving the integrity and freshness of transported temperature sensitive products. CSC is also known to be energy intensive with a significant emission footprint. As a result, CSC requires strict monitoring and control management system during storage and transportation to improve safety and reduce profit losses. In this research, a systematic review of recent literature related to the distribution of food CSC products is presented and possible areas to extend research in modeling and decision-making are identified. Design/methodology/approach: The paper analyzes the content of 65 recent articles related to CSC and perishable foods. Several relevant keywords were used in the initial search, which generated a list of 214 articles. The articles were screened based on content relevance in terms of food vehicle routing modeling and quality. Selected articles were categorized and analyzed based on cost elements, modeling framework and solution approach. Finally, recommendations for future research are suggested. Findings: The review identified several research gaps in CSC logistics literature, where more focused research is warranted. First, the review suggests that dynamic vehicle modeling and routing while considering products quality and environmental impacts is still an open area for research. Second, there is no consensus among researchers in terms of quality degradation models used to assess the freshness of transported cold food. As a result, an investigation of critical parameters and quality modeling is warranted. Third, and due to the problem complexity, there is a need for developing heuristics and metaheuristics to solve such models. Finally, there is a need for extending the single product single compartment CSC to multi-compartment multi-temperature routing modeling. Originality/value: The article identified possible areas to extend research in CSC distribution modeling and decision-making. Modified models that reflect real applications will help practitioners, food authorities and researchers make timely and more accurate decisions that will reduce food waste and improve the freshness of transported food.",Vehicle routing in cold food supply chain logistics: a literature review,Cold supply chain *** Food distribution *** Vehicle routing problem,international journal of logistics management,85097231110,2020,0,0,0,,,
"© 2020 Hua Gong et al. In this paper, we study several coordinated production-delivery scheduling problems with potential disruption motivated by a supply chain in the manufacturing industry. Both single-machine environment and identical parallel-machine environment are considered in the production part. The jobs finished on the machines are delivered to the same customer in batches. Each delivery batch has a capacity and incurs a delivery cost. There is a situation that a possible disruption in the production part may occur at some particular time and will last for a period of time with a probability. We consider both resumable case and nonresumable case where a job does not need (needs) to restart if it is disrupted for a resumable (nonresumable) case. The objective is to find a coordinated schedule of production and delivery that minimizes the expected total flow times plus the delivery costs. We first present some properties and analyze the NP-hard complexity for four various problems. For the corresponding single-machine and parallel-machine scheduling problems, pseudo-polynomial-time algorithms and fully polynomial-time approximation schemes (FPTASs) are presented in this paper, respectively.",Scheduling on a Single Machine and Parallel Machines with Batch Deliveries and Potential Disruption, ,complexity,85092206595,2020,0,0,0,,,
"© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. Unpredictable occurrence of any disaster emerges immeasurable demand in an affected society. Importance of immediate response in the aftermath of disaster is a crucial part of humanitarian logistic. Resource redistribution among the affected areas makes the optimal allocation in this chaotic situation. The research work has introduced a transportation plan considering the redistribution of resources from those areas which has already acquired relief and restored the normal condition to those areas still not being recovered from the effect of calamities. This research plan is developed to minimize the total cost of the relief operation as well as optimal allocation of the resources. The optimal allocation amidst the disruption of some resource storing points in the aftermath attack of disaster is also one of the key factors of the research. This research work has a great impact for decision-maker to derive an appropriate decision-making in such an anarchic situation of critical humanitarian supply chain. Due to the complexity of disaster, the model is considered in mixed uncertain environment. A numerical study is also performed to show the smooth functioning of the mathematical model assuming the uncertainty by trapezoidal neutrosophic number.

"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd The ubiquitous use of Internet of Things (IoT) ranges from industrial control systems to e-Health, e-commerce, smart cities, agriculture, supply chain management, smart cars, cyber-physical systems and a lot more. However, the data collected and processed by IoT systems especially the ones with centralized control are vulnerable to availability, integrity, and privacy threats. Hence, we present “PrivySharing,” a blockchain-based innovative framework for privacy-preserving and secure IoT data sharing in a smart city environment. The proposed scheme is distinct from existing strategies on many aspects. The data privacy is preserved by dividing the blockchain network into various channels, where every channel comprises a finite number of authorized organizations and processes a specific type of data such as health, smart car, smart energy or financial details. Moreover, access to users’ data within a channel is controlled by embedding access control rules in the smart contracts. In addition, data within a channel is further isolated and secured by using private data collection and encryption respectively. Likewise, the REST API that enables clients to interact with the blockchain network has dual security in the form of an API Key and OAuth 2.0. The proposed solution conforms to some of the significant requirements outlined in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. We also present a system of reward in the form of a digital token named “PrivyCoin” for users sharing their data with stakeholders/third parties. Lastly, the experimental outcomes advocate that a multi-channel blockchain scales well as compared to a single-channel blockchain system.",PrivySharing: A blockchain-based framework for privacy-preserving and secure data sharing in smart cities,Blockchain *** EU GDPR Compliance *** Internet of Things *** Security and privacy *** Smart city,computers and security,85074150487,2020,0,0,,,,
"Purpose To coordinate humanitarian organisations with different mandates that flock the scenes of disasters to save lives and respond to varied needs arising from the increased number of victims is not easy. Therefore, the level at which organisations self-organise, network and adapt to the dynamic operational environment may be related to inter-organisational coordination. The authors studied self-organisation, organisational networks and adaptability as important and often overlooked organisational factors hypothesised to be related to inter-organisational coordination in the context of humanitarian organisations. Design/methodology/approach The study's sample consisted of 101 humanitarian organisations with 315 respondents. To decrease the problem of common method variance, the authors split the samples within each humanitarian organisation into two subsamples: one subsample was used for the measurement of self-organisation, organisational network and adaptability, while the other was for the measurement of inter-organisational coordination. Findings The partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) analysis using SmartPLS 3.2.8 indicated that self-organisation is related to inter-organisational coordination. Organisational network and adaptability were found to be mediators for the relationship between self-organisation and inter-organisational coordination and all combined accounted for 57.8% variance in inter-organisational coordination. Research limitations/implications The study was cross sectional, hence imposing a limitation on changes in perceptions over time. Perhaps, a longitudinal study in future is desirable. Data were collected only from humanitarian organisations that had delivered relief to refugees in the stated camps by 2018. Above all, this study considered self-organisation, adaptability and organisational networks in the explanation of inter-organisational coordination, although there are other factors that could still be explored. Practical implications A potential implication is that humanitarian organisations which need to coordinate with others in emergency situations may need to examine their ability to self-organise, network and adapt. Social implications Social transformation is a function of active social entities that cannot work in isolation. Hence, for each to be able to make a contribution to meaningful social change, there is need to develop organisational networks with sister organisations so as to secure rare resources that facilitate change efforts coupled with the ability to reorganise themselves and adapt to changing environmental circumstances. Originality/value The paper examines (1) the extent to which self-organisation, adaptability and organisational networks influence inter-organisational coordination; (2) the mediating role of both adaptability and organisational networks between self-organisation and inter-organisational coordination in the context of humanitarian organisations against the backdrop of complex adaptive system (CAS) theory.","Self-organisation, adaptability, organisational networks and inter-organisational coordination: empirical evidence from humanitarian organisations in Uganda",Self-organisation *** Adaptability *** Organisational networks *** Inter-organisational coordination *** Humanitarian organisations,journal of humanitarian logistics and supply chain management,WOS:000563499500001,0,0,0,,,,
"Copyright © FrancoAngeli. Among the critical issues that have emerged significantly in recent weeks, the crisis in the procurement of antiCovid sanitary material is of great importance, characterized by delays, lack of supplies, prices out of control, difficulties in finding uniform material throughout the national territory. In our opinion, these “inconveniences” are evidence of a lack of “governance capacity” which characterizes the purchasing processes of medical material as a whole and which also characterized the model chosen to meet the need for supplies pending the pandemic. Phase 2 of the health system, and above all of the procurement chain, requires first of all to reflect on the new political agenda of the health system, restoring the correct order of priorities: • health protection, as well as health education policies, represent the essential conditions for long-term economic and social sustainability; • the health policy choices must take into account the consequences in terms of sustainability of the supply markets, the presence of local suppliers, the implications of any opportunistic behavior of private operators; • institutional collaboration, and not the opposition, between multiple levels of government, between citizens and institutions, between political forces, is fundamental for overcoming emergency situations and for reinventing systems for responding to complex and often unpredictable needs. With specific reference to procurement, supply chains and their complexity must be revisited, paying greater attention to factors such as (a) location of key suppliers, (b) reliability of suppliers (e.g. vendor rating), (c) availability of sources alternative qualified procurement, (d) ability of suppliers to operate during an emergency even for long periods.",Beyond the miracle of emergency.

"© The Author(s) 2020. The Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy and the Committee on Climate Change place high dependency on the electrification of heat and use of heat pump systems to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Energy efficient buildings are essential for effective heat pump operation. However, the UK’s housing stock is amongst the least energy efficient in Europe. Household electricity demand will increase with heat pump use, meaning reinforcement to infrastructure and generation capacity. This study uses dynamic simulation modelling to determine the optimum energy efficient retrofit required to minimise energy use and electrical demand for an average semi-detached dwelling using a heat pump. Solid wall insulation is found to be critical in energy abatement, although the heat pump operates at a high demand compared with low voltage network design. A whole house retrofit in-line with current Building Regulations reduces the heating demand and emissions by 65%, and lowers the input electrical demand for the heat pump to under 1 kW. Solid wall insulation and low U-value glazing are the cost-optimal solution, achieving similar abatement. Measures that exceed building regulations are shown to lower heat demand and carbon emissions by almost 80%, highlighting scope for improvement in retrofit standards. Practical application: At present, UK policy makers have a preferred alternative to high carbon fossil fuels that is a system heavily reliant on heat pumps powered by low carbon electricity. Heat pump systems require energy efficient buildings to operate effectively. A key factor when improving building efficiency is fabric standards, which can dramatically impact the heat transfer coefficient. Retrofit of energy efficiency measures is key to future net zero success and will have large implications to consumers and supply chains alike.",Residential retrofit in the UK: The optimum retrofit measures necessary for effective heat pump use,"energy efficiency, sustainability, dynamic thermal modelling *** heat pump *** insulation *** low carbon *** Residential *** retrofit",building services engineering research and technology,85096911706,2020,0,0,0,,,
"© 2020 China Agricultural University For small farmers wishing to sell their products under the “local agriculture” marketing concept, connecting with consumers can be challenging. One approach to mitigating this disconnect between where production occurs and where consumers reside is through a network of regional consolidation points. In this study, we utilize optimization models to assist the Missouri Coalition of Environment (MCE) in helping farmers from Missouri and Illinois route products from their farms to a central hub in St. Louis. The aim of this study was to minimize the ton-miles traveled by farmers and MCE vehicles in delivering agricultural products from farms to regional hubs to the central hub. Given historical data about variability of plant and animal production in the Greater Plains region, a robust optimization approach was incorporated to increase the likelihood that the network can accommodate uncertainty in agricultural production. GAMS/CPLEX was used to solve the model under different configurations and identify potential locations for regional hubs. Computational testing determined that the capacity of hubs plays a key role in the optimal assignments: given the assumed model constraint that farmers can travel only to their nearest regional hub, solutions may sacrifice a better objective function value in order to accommodate farmers’ travel requirements.",Network design for local agriculture using robust optimization,Optimization *** Robustness and sensitivity analysis *** Supply chain management,information processing in agriculture,85092216325,2020,0,0,0,,,

Several LNG-fueled vessels are already operating, and the LNG market is expected to grow further in the next years. A capillary marine LNG infrastructure network is developing to strengthen the fuel supply chain, which includes smallscale LNG storage and bunkering installations. However, safety remains a crucial aspect for the expansion of sustainable and reliable LNG technologies due to flammability hazards of natural gas. Storage tanks are vulnerable units from a safety point of view: External fires might affect LNG tanks leading to their catastrophic failure with a possibility of accident escalation. The present contribution aims at the evaluation of thermal response of storage tanks exposed to high levels of thermal radiation from distant sources, such as a pool fires generated after the ignition of LNG spills. A two-dimension computational fluid dynamic (CFD) approach is applied to predict tank pressurization rate and temperature distribution for a set of case studies. The results obtained give insight about the dynamic response of pressurized cryogenic vessels involved in process accidents, providing a useful contribution to emergency response planning as well as identifying important safety aspects regarding LNG storage and distribution chain.",LNG Tanks exposed to distant pool fires: A cfd study, ,chemical engineering transactions,85094210857,2020,0,0,0,,,
"Copyright © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd. Small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the world economy. In today's challenging and dynamic business environment, popularly referred to as VUCA short for volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity, SMEs need to continually adapt and adopt technological solutions to stay competitive. Cloud computing is a disruptive information and communication technology (ICT) tool, which can be leveraged by SMEs for this purpose. However widespread adoption of cloud computing in SMEs is elusive. In this paper, we analyse the attributes that influence the adoption of cloud computing in SMEs using techniques like importance performance analysis (IPA), analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy-AHP. IPA technique is used to identify the areas of improvement for service providers as also improve their efficiency. AHP technique has been used to rank different attributes of the technology in the order of preference from an SME's perspective. Both results are studied conjointly thereby re-iterating the importance of certain attributes of the technology so as to help managers devise strategies to increase the adoption of cloud-based technologies.","Cloud-based technology for small and medium scale enterprises: A decision-making paradigm using IPA, AHP and fuzzy-AHP techniques",AHP *** Analytic hierarchy process *** CBSCM *** Cloud-based supply chain management *** Fuzzy-AHP *** Importance performance analysis *** Industry 4.0. *** IPA *** Small and medium scale enterprises *** SMEs,international journal of integrated supply management,85095748249,2020,0,0,0,0,,

"© The Author(s) 2020. Decisions regarding neutralizing airborne threats in the combat environment require comprehensive knowledge of resources at hand and enemy intentions. The complexity of the situation has resulted in the emergence of various models encompassing important factors of threat neutralization. Various characteristics of airborne threats considered important for their assessment have already been identified in previous literature, which include speed, distance, approach angle, maneuverability, and so on. Due to the possible extent of loss to critical assets, literature has emphasized on identifying as many useful characteristics of threats as possible. This study is also a step in this direction to improve the weapon assignment for threat neutralization. Weapon assignment based on a well-calculated threat index is a key to success in military conflicts. The purpose of this article is to identify new factors through the involvement of experts. In this study, a set of factors has been identified through a survey of relevant literature and semi-structured interviews followed by its refinement through a three-round Delphi study. The results suggest that airborne threats are considered different from other threats due to their lethality and consequences. The top-level decision-makers require a comprehensive understanding of the criticality of the situation and the effects of poor decisions. Besides other factors, weapon stock, supply chain information, and analysis of vulnerable assets/points in threat neutralization are critical to accomplish higher efficiency. The shortlisted factors yield a foundation of a comprehensive framework for decision making in a highly dynamic environment of air defense.",Critical Success Factors for Neutralization of Airborne Threats,air defense *** airborne threats *** decision factors *** Delphi study *** threat evaluation *** threat neutralization *** vulnerable assets,sage open,85091749868,2020,0,0,0,,,

Complexity modelling of economic efficiency and growth potential is increasingly essential for countries and provinces. Evaluating the monetary flows, kinetic energy (efficiency) and potential capacity (resilience) provides crucial information for economic development. In the paper, the authors analyze growth opportunities for the Chinese economy from a system science point of view, using the perspective of information entropy, based on the input-output tables. Over the past four decades of reform and opening-up, China has made remarkable progress in its economic development. In 2007, China's GDP was at its fastest pace in history at 14.2% growth. However, after the financial crisis in 2008, the global economy experienced a downward trend and China's economic development also settled on a medium-low level of development. The traditional perspective is to rank regional development only based on GDP growth, whereas here, the authors advocate another evaluation method based on efficiency and potential growth. Unbalanced regional economic development has become problematic and has become a barrier for sustainability of China's economy. The results of the research indicate firstly that China's regional development in 2007 and 2012 has been unequal between the provinces. Secondly, the authors found that Shandong province had significantly higher indicators for efficiency and potential growth than others in the same circumstances. Authors observe that provinces tend to carry out industrial policies and adjust the structure of industry on a local level. This analysis demonstrates that the spatial imbalance of efficiency and potential of economic development under the perspective of provincial-level regions. From the perspective of industry, it indicates that the supply chain is too short, mainly focusing on the mining and processing of resources and minerals in the original upstream industry chain, while the downstream is not fully utilized. These represent some unique insights yielded through this type of analysis that authors advocate applying more broadly.",Complexity theory for the modern Chinese economy from an information entropy perspective: Modeling of economic efficiency and growth potential, ,plos one,85078687898,2020,1,1,1,,,
"© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to understand the different types of risks affecting the demand for the automotive sector in India. The study is further trying to illustrate an approach for analyzing the relative intensities of these risks in the present uncertain business environment. Design/methodology/approach: Risk on the overall demand is assessed by a combined Bayesian – multi-criteria decision-making approach. Data related to the different factors, affecting their product demand is collected from major automobile firms. Then, weights for these factors are evaluated by applying the analytic hierarchy process approach. Further, these weights are used in the Bayesian analysis network to evaluate the risk intensity for different subgroups, namely, political, economic, social, technological and environmental. Findings: From the literature and experts’ opinion, total 16 risk factors have been finalized and these are further grouped into 5 categories i.e. political, economic, social, technological and environmental. It is observed that the demand for organizations functioning in the automotive sector is more vulnerable to economic risk as compared to other risks considered in the study. Practical implications: Managers and decision makers of associated organizations can use the proposed framework to assess the demand risks so as to pre-evaluate their demand corresponding to future changes. Factors can be added or removed and importance could be assigned to different risk factors according to the prevailing business environment for an organization or sector. This will also help the organizations to conduct a more effective risk management in an uncertain business environment. Originality/value: The study will help in better understanding of the various demand risks prevalent in the Indian auto sector. The methodology used, provides a novel approach for assessing the macroeconomic demand risks and can be used by the firms working in the automotive sector. The proposed methodology could be used for assessing supply chain risk or any other business initiative risk.

"Traditional logistics management has not focused on environmental concerns when designing and optimizing food supply chain networks. However, the protection of the environment is one of the main factors that should be considered based on environmental protection regulations of countries. In this paper, environmental concerns are considered in formulating a mathematical model to design and configure a multi-period, multi-product, multi-echelon green meat supply chain network. We develop a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming formulation to optimize three objectives simultaneously: minimization of the total cost, minimization of the total CO2 emissions released from transportation, and maximization of the total capacity utilization of facilities. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed optimization model, we design a green meat supply chain network for Southern Ontario, Canada. A solution approach based on augmented epsilon-constraint method is employed to solve the proposed model. As a result, a set of Pareto-optimal solutions is obtained. The set of Pareto-optimal solutions gives decision-makers the opportunity to make a trade-off between economic, environmental, and capacity utilization objectives. Our example shows that it is possible to keep emissions reasonably low without incurring high total costs. Finally, the impacts of uncertainty on the proposed model are investigated using several decision trees. Optimization of a food supply chain, particularly a meat supply chain, based on multiple objectives under uncertainty using decision trees is a new approach in the literature.",Designing a green meat supply chain network: A multi-objective approach,Meat supply chain *** Decision tree *** Multi-objective programming *** Mixed-integer linear programming *** Augmented epsilon-constraint,international journal of production economics,WOS:000504505100025,2020,1,,,,,
"Scheduling can be defined as the allocation of available resources over time while optimising a set of criteria like early completion time of task, holding inventory, etc. The complexity of the scheduling problem, already known to be high, increases if dynamic events and disruptions are considered. In addition, in production and logistics, designers of scheduling systems must consider sustainability-related expectations. This paper presents an energy-efficient scheduling and rescheduling method (named Green Rescheduling Method, GRM). GRM aims at the solving of the dynamic scheduling problem under the condition of a certain level of routing flexibility enabling the reassignment of tasks to new resources. The key performance indicators integrated into the proposed GRM are effectiveness and efficiency-oriented. Applications concern the domains of production and logistics. In order to assess the proposed approach, experimentations have been made and results illustrate the applicability of GRM to build efficient and effective scheduling and rescheduling both for flexible manufacturing systems and inventory distribution systems in a physical internet network.

"The procurement of food grains from farmers and their transportation to regional level has become decisive due to increasing food demand and post-harvest losses in developing countries. To overcome these challenges, this paper attempts to develop a robust data-driven supply chain model for the efficient procurement of food grains in India. Following the data collected from three leading wheat producing Indian regions, a mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated for minimising total supply chain network costs and determining number and location of procurement centres. The NK Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (NKHGA) is employed to cluster the villages, along with a novel density-based approach to optimise the supply chain network. Sensitivity analysis indicates that policymakers should focus on creating an adequate number of procurement centres in each surplus state, well before the start of the harvesting season. The study is expected to benefit food grain supply chain stakeholders such as farmers, procurement agencies, logistics providers and government bodies in making an informed decision.",Modelling supply chain network for procurement of food grains in India,food supply chain *** modelling and optimisation *** food grains *** clustering *** genetic algorithm *** procurement,international journal of production research,WOS:000492116800001,2020,0,0,,,,
"In recent years, attention to blood supply chain in disaster circumstances has significantly increased. Disasters, especially earthquakes, have adverse consequences such as destruction, loss of human lives, and undermining the effectiveness of health services. This research considers a six-echelon blood supply chain which consists of donors, blood collection centers (permanent and temporary), regional blood centers, local blood centers, regional hospitals, and local hospitals. For the first time, we considered that helicopters could carry blood from regional hospitals to local hospitals and return injured people that cannot be treated in local hospitals to regional hospitals due to the limited capacity. In addition to the above, different transportations with limited capacities regarded, where the optimal number of required transportations equipment determined after the solution process. This research aims to avoid the worst consequences of a disaster using a neural-learning process to gain from past experiences to meet new challenges. For this aim, this article considers three objective functions that are minimizing total transportation time and cost while minimizing unfulfilled demand. The model implemented based on a real-world case study from the most recent earthquake in the Iran-Iraq border which named the deadliest earthquake of 2017. Based on our results, we learned how to design an efficient blood supply chain that can fulfill hospitals blood demand quickly with the lowest cost using simulation and optimization processes.

"Supply networks (SN) must maintain operations and connectedness under disruptions to remain competitive; this is referred to as SN resilience. Building a resilient SN is an underlying challenge in supply chain management. In this paper, SN resilience is examined from the complex network topology perspective to understand how supply chain managers construct resilient networks. The proposed growth model considers enterprises leaving the network, which previous studies have ignored. Considering the heterogeneous roles of enterprises, new metrics based on a new proposed sub-network concept are presented to evaluate resilience. Using a computer simulation, the resilience of the SN generated by the model proposed in this paper is compared with that of other models, and the results indicate that (i) the proposed model can be tuned to generate a desired resilient network; (ii) the proposed metrics capture the resilience requirements of the SN very well; (iii) the more uniform the distribution of the enterprises, the more resilient the corresponding SN; and (iv) the higher the values of alpha and beta, the lower the SN resilience, and beta affects the resilience more than alpha does.",Research on supply network resilience considering random and targeted disruptions simultaneously,Supply network resilience *** supply network growth model *** supply network topology *** complex network *** disruptions,international journal of production research,WOS:000494078700001,2020,1,1,,,,

"Sustainability is gaining importance in the Indian manufacturing industries, as there are increasing considerations from stakeholders for resource utilization and for reducing ecological impacts. Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) can resolve many environmental management problems along with the gain of several competitive advantages for future. We formulate in this research, an integrative decision-making model for SSCM in the Indian context, which considers several strategies, interfaces, and regulations for sustainability along with the attributes contributing to each. A network model is constructed from an initial flow model and the weightings for factors were calculated using the method of paired comparison by the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Later, Analytic Network Process (ANP) has been employed for the comparison of alternative schemes for selection of a particular SSCM strategy into implementation. We assess two alternative schemes in practice for sustainability and from the results; we observe that Scheme 2 excels Scheme 1, considering sustainability capabilities. Also, from the factor weightings, we observe that standardization of nature-friendly (NF) technologies and green segment size emerges as important factors for the case supply chain. A comparison of the results from AHP and ANP is conducted with other popular multi-criteria decision-making techniques, TOPSIS and VIKOR and the results were analyzed. Also, we conduct sensitivity analysis of the results. The implications of the study are in a direction to aid the managerial decision-making process, through effectively comparing various schemes to implementation for their sustainability capabilities.",Sustainable supply chains in the Indian context: An integrative decision-making model,Sustainability *** Sustainable supply chains *** Decision-making *** AHP *** ANP,technology in society,WOS:000531531900020,2020,0,0,,,,
"Government-sponsored school lunch programs have garnered attention from activists and policymakers for their potential to promote public health, sustainable diets, and food sovereignty. However, across country contexts, these programs often fall far short of their transformative potential. It is vital, then, to identify policies and organizing strategies that enable school lunch programs to be redesigned at the national scale. In this article, we use document analysis of historical newspapers and government data to examine the motivating factors and underlying conditions that allowed South Korea's universal free, eco-friendly (UFEF) school lunch program to become a tool for advancing social justice and ecological goals at the national scale. We analyze the socio-historical evolution and current status of the Korean school lunch program, combining the multi-level perspective with insights from environmental sociology and critical food studies, in order to shed light on the factors that enabled the program to become an innovative niche and articulate the opportunities and challenges it now faces. We identify the state-sponsored creation of what we call precautionary infrastructure as a key anchoring mechanism between the school food niche and agri-food regime. Precautionary infrastructure includes new supply chains, certification standards, and sourcing policies that provide a stable market for eco-friendly farms and small-scale producers, while minimizing the environmental health risks of school lunch by delivering organic and pesticide-free ingredients to on-site kitchens that serve free lunches to all students. This analysis offers insight into how public school-lunch programs can become protected niches that help drive sustainability transitions within agri-food systems.","Sustainability transitions in agri-food systems: insights from South Korea's universal free, eco-friendly school lunch program",School lunch *** Sustainability transitions *** Precautionary consumption *** Corporeal citizenship *** Korean school lunch policy *** Food sovereignty,agriculture and human values,WOS:000555384400001,2020,0,0,,,,
"The research explores key factors impacting enterprise operational sustainability and the ability to transcend adversity during different stages of a crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study draws from the Theory of Crisis Management Teams, the Stakeholder Theory, and the Distributed Cognition Theory to build an Enterprise Effectiveness and Sustainability Model during Pandemic. Existing theoretical background joint with contemporary success case studies helped to identify the essential aspects and strategies enterprises should employ to survive and thrive during crisis and post-crisis. We have conceptualized an innovative approach to COVID-19 from the perspective of organizational characteristics, operations, digital transformation, and financial planning. The findings suggest that enterprises having distributed leadership, workforce and adaptive culture sustain business operations during a pandemic. Furthermore, resilient enterprises allow for more informed and decentralized decision-making. Prosperous organizations leverage Internet and Communication Technology (ICT) and integrate Intranet, social media, and online communication platforms into their daily business routines, as this helps to establish trust and build bonds with employees, stakeholders, and customers during and post-crisis. Finally, balancing between the stockpiling of resources and resiliency is crucial in anticipation of a crisis.

"Purpose Third-party logistic providers (3PLs) continuously strive for controlling and improving their performances to gain a competitive advantage. The challenging environment where they operate is affected by high variety in type and number of clients, the inventory mix and the demand profiles they have to meet. Consequently, better understanding the dynamics of warehousing operations and the characteristics of the inventory mix is critical to handle such a complexity. Design/Methodology/approach This paper proposes a decision-support framework, suited for 3PL warehouse practitioners, that aids to design and implement effective and affordable activities for measuring and improving the warehousing performances. Such goal is pursued by the framework by leading the managers through an initial mapping and diagnosis of the system, then by developing a tailored measurement system to track the performance, paving the way to the identification of the criticalities and the potential improvement scenarios. Findings This paper presents a case study on the implementation of the proposed framework at a warehouse of an Italian 3PL provider to introduce a new storage assignment policy and reduce the travelling time for order picking. Furthermore, the paper exemplifies how the framework contributes to enhance the awareness of managers on warehousing operations and the involvement of the personnel throughout the improvement process. Originality/value Instead of focusing on the proper methods and models that optimize a specific task or performance indicator, it provides a general framework that leads the managers through the decisional process, from the preliminary diagnosis of the system, to its benchmarking, towards the implementation of corrective and improving solutions.",Warehousing process performance improvement: a tailored framework for 3PL,3PL *** Warehousing process *** Decision-support framework *** Performance improvement,business process management journal,WOS:000514615500001,2020,0,0,,,,
"Purpose Humanitarian supply chains (HSCs) by their very nature require urgent reaction to unforeseeable needs, making it difficult to properly plan for the support of actual demands. As such, integrating sustainability into traditional HSC practices continues to present a challenge to governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and other humanitarian-related agencies. This study focuses on identifying and categorizing the leading enablers to green humanitarian supply chains (GHSCs) and proposes a model for improving the responsiveness based upon a fuzzy total interpretive structural modelling approach. Design/methodology/approach Total interpretive structural modelling (TISM) uses group decision-making to identify contextual relationships among each pair of enablers and elucidates the nature of each underlying relationship. The fuzzy TISM shows the level of strength (very high influence, high influence, low influence and very low influence) of each enabler in relation to other enablers, which can help to inform management decision-making. Findings GHSC management requires strategic planning of inventory and logistics management. The importance of collaborative relationship building with HSC partners for developing capability and the effective use of available resources are keys to success. These improved relationships also help to promote postponement and similar speculation-based logistics strategies, as well as advanced purchasing and pre-positioning strategies. Finally, the speed and quality of response is found to be the top enabler in GHSC management. Research limitations/implications - One noted shortcoming of the chosen research method is its reliance on subjective expert judgement. However, collecting judgements is at the basis of many research methods, and the research team took utmost care throughout the research process to allay biases. Future empirical research can further examine the relationships suggested herein. Managers can use the model developed in this research to consider impactful ways to design and execute sustainable HSCs. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is a novel attempt to identify enablers to GHSC management. Secondly, the research team has used an advanced methodology (fuzzy TISM) to develop the contextual inter-relationships among the enablers which has not been used earlier in this direction before and thus advances the GHSC literature.",Towards understanding key enablers to green humanitarian supply chain management practices,Enablers *** Green *** Humanitarian supply chain (HSC) *** MICMAC *** South Africa *** Sustainability *** Fuzzy total interpretive structural modelling (fuzzy TISM),management of environmental quality,WOS:000517342900001,2020,0,0,0,,,
"Growing awareness about the environmental and social issues and pressure from all stakeholders has forced industries to adopt sustainability practices in their supply chains. Suppliers contribute significantly to establishing an effective sustainable supply chain. Hence industries need to evaluate its potential suppliers precisely on sustainability criteria. In this work, a two-phase decision model using Fuzzy Interference System (FIS) along with Fuzzy Kano philosophy for the sustainable environment has been proposed to select sustainable suppliers for a large scale industry. In the first phase, sustainability criteria clustering using fuzzy Kano model has been performed for the identification of 'Must-be' criteria in economic, environmental and social dimensions. Further, sub-criteria with quantified evaluation levels for Must-be criteria have been established. In the second phase, the three distinct Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) has been developed for evaluating the Sustainability Performance Index (SPI) values of each supplier in three sustainability dimensions. In FIS, the architecture of each model is modified in such a way that each FIS engine have to compute the minimum number of rules. Finally, weights are assigned to SPI in each dimension, and suppliers are ranked for final selection. Sensitivity analysis has been performed to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed decision framework. A sustainable supplier selection problem of the iron and steel industry of India has been investigated to show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed decision framework.

"Based on the uncertain conditions such as uncertainty in blood demand and facility disruptions, and also, due to the uncertain nature of blood products such as perishable lifetime, distinct blood groups, and ABO-Rh(D) compatibility and priority rules among these groups, this paper aims to contribute blood supply chains under uncertainty. In this respect, this paper develops a bi-objective two-stage stochastic programming model for managing a red blood cells supply chain that observes above-mentioned issues. This model determines the optimum location-allocation and inventory management decisions and aims to minimize the total cost of the supply chain includes fixed costs, operating costs, inventory holding costs, wastage costs, and transportation costs along with minimizing the substitution levels to provide safer blood transfusion services. To handle the uncertainty of the blood supply chain environment, a robust optimization approach is devised to tackle the uncertainty of parameters, and the TH method is utilized to make the bi-objective model solvable. Then, a real case study of Mashhad city, in Iran, is implemented to demonstrate the model practicality as well as its solution approaches, and finally, the computational results are presented and discussed. Further, the impacts of the different parameters on the results are analyzed which help the decision makers to select the value of the parameters more accurately.","Blood supply chain management: robust optimization, disruption risk, and blood group compatibility (a real-life case)",Blood supply chain *** Multi-objective programming *** Robust optimization *** Disruption risk *** Blood group compatibility,journal of ambient intelligence and humanized computing,WOS:000514541600015,2020,0,0,0,,,
"In the context of a growing world population and the need to use limited resources responsibly, this study is motivated by the increasing pressures on the food industry, which include issues of food security, safety, and waste. In the context of a global food supply chain, we combine processing time and cost (PT&C) with operational risk (ORk) in a novel integrated approach to designing and optimizing monitoring systems. This study of a flagship product widely consumed around the world provides quantitative analysis and results based on real-world data from an international food company. The findings indicate that our multi-objective methodology provides quantitative insights into-and is capable of quantifying-an unexpected nonlinear relationship between PT&C and ORk. We show numerically how to decrease PT&C significantly by means of a minor increase in ORk, an outcome which is highly appealing for the industry. In addition, we provide accurate measurements of the impact of each individual monitoring activity, which allows the identification of the monitoring activities that are most critical. Generalizable insights for practitioners are derived from a step-by-step optimization of the entire monitoring system.",Optimizing the trade-off between performance measures and operational risk in a food supply chain environment,Supply chain management *** Manufacturing *** Quality management *** Risk management,soft computing,WOS:000518603800019,2020,0,0,0,,,
"The purpose of the study is presentation of the method of increasing the competitiveness of the mining industry through the demonstration of the possibility and potential in closing the loop of supply chains through waste management. A critical analysis of the source literature and an arithmetic analysis of statistical data in static and dynamic perspectives were accepted to be the research method. It has been found that the structure of the level of mining wastes and the level of their recovery rates demonstrate a large potential of closing the loop of chains in this industry and, at the same time, a potential to extend the chains through directing the material from recovery to various sectors. This constitutes an example of the direction of activities that are in line with the EU strategies for the economies of other states which possess this type wastes.",WASTE MANAGEMENT AS AN ELEMENT OF THE CREATION OF A CLOSED LOOP OF SUPPLY CHAINS ON THE EXAMPLE OF MINING AND EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRY,closed loop of supply chain *** mining *** sustainable supply chain *** wastes,management systems in production engineering,WOS:000520868000010,2020,0,0,0,,,
"This paper extends a traditional supply chain network design problem through two perspectives, i.e., the multiperiod decision environment and the environmental concerns. A planning horizon contains multiple periods. Different periods have different demands of products and hence should have different supply chain decisions, which mainly include facilities' locations, the environment protection level in facilities, as well as the transportation flows of products in the supply chain. For each facility in two consecutive periods, the changes of the location and environment protection level related decisions may incur adjustment cost. A bi-objective mixed-integer programming model is proposed to minimize both the total cost and the CO2 emissions of the supply chain during the planning horizon with multiple periods. A solution approach is proposed to solve the model. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm.",A Bi-Objective Model on Multiperiod Green Supply Chain Network Design,Supply chains *** Green products *** Planning *** Transportation *** Air pollution *** Numerical models *** Bi-objective *** environment *** green supply chain *** multiperiod *** transportation,ieee transactions on systems man cybernetics-systems,WOS:000521966800004,2020,0,0,0,,,
"Sustainability of Industrial Symbiosis (IS) businesses plays a key role in supporting the circular economy. Industrial symbiosis networks (ISNs) can survive in the long run if they have high resilience to perturbations that lead to operational uncertainties. The literature highlights that the resilience of ISNs can be enhanced by ensuring high redundancy of IS relationships: accordingly, firms should exchange the same waste with more symbiotic partners. However, the impact of increasing redundancy on economic and environmental performance of IS has not been investigated so far. This paper proposes a theoretical framework to understand the effect of the redundancy strategy on the performance of companies involved in IS. Accordingly, the optimal redundancy strategy refers to an optimal number of partners to (from) which waste producers (users) should send (receive) wastes to maximize the IS performance. An agent-based model is designed to explore the proposed framework and an agent-based simulation is applied to a marble-concrete IS case. The analysis shows that the optimal redundancy strategy is influenced by the combined effect of waste market dynamicity and transaction costs, and is usually different when viewed from an economic versus an environmental perspective. The paper provides a theoretical contribution based upon the integration of operational aspects of IS with the redundancy concept in IS-based businesses. The adopted methodology is innovative as it integrates willingness to cooperate, bargaining power, and inter-company trust development into the business decision-making process. Finally, how to overcome trade-off challenges between environmental and economic performance is discussed from managerial and practical perspectives.",The role of redundancy in industrial symbiotic business development: A theoretical framework explored by agent-based simulation,Self-organized industrial symbiosis *** Redundancy *** Agent-based modeling *** Sustainability *** Resilience *** Circular economy,international journal of production economics,WOS:000525321300022,2020,1,1,1,,,
"This paper presents a multi-objective, multi-period inventory routing problem in the supply chain of perishable products under uncertain costs. In addition to traditional objectives of cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission minimization, a novel objective of priority index maximization has been introduced in the model. The priority index quantifies the qualitative social aspects, such as coordination, trust, behavior, and long-term relationships among the stakeholders. In a multi-echelon supply chain, the performance of distributor/retailer is affected by the performance of supplier/distributor. The priority index measures the relative performance index of each player within the supply chain. The maximization of priority index ensures the achievement of social sustainability in the supply chain. Moreover, to model cost uncertainty, a time series integrated regression fuzzy method is developed. This research comprises of three phases. In the first phase, a mixed-integer multi-objective mathematical model while considering the cost uncertainty has been formulated. In order to determine the parameters for priority index objective function, a two-phase fuzzy inference process is used and the rest of the objectives (cost and GHG) have been modeled mathematically. The second phase involves the development of solution methodology. In this phase, to solve the mathematical model, a modified interactive multi-objective fuzzy programming has been employed that incorporates experts' preferences for objective satisfaction based on their experiences. Finally, in the third phase, a case study of the supply chain of surgical instruments is presented as an example. The results of the case provide optimal flow of products from suppliers to hospitals and the optimal sequence of the visits of different vehicle types that minimize total cost, GHG emissions, and maximizes the priority index.",Inventory Routing Problem in Supply Chain of Perishable Products under Cost Uncertainty,inventory routing problem *** time series predicted uncertain costs *** time series integrated regression fuzzy *** priority index *** fuzzy-inference system (FIS) *** modified interactive multi-objective fuzzy programming,mathematics,WOS:000524085900081,2020,0,0,0,,,
"Due to rapid urbanization, logistics providers are dealing with the conundrum of misaligned strategies for urban environments. Logistics providers often see the urbanness of an activity region as a constraint, while at the same time urban actors view logistics activities within their immediate environment as disruption. These attitudes obscure the value that logistics can provide for urban areas. The current research synchronizes the notions of urban and logistics by reconceptualizing urbanness (i.e., an area's state of being urban) from the logistics service provider's perspective. Utilizing a conceptual abstraction technique, the concept of urbanness is revised and differentiated to redefine urban areas as value clusters looking to balance supply and demand globally while also providing access to service at the local urban level. Further, logistics service providers are seen as offering value to urban areas through network logistics and localized logistics. Identifying these differentiated value propositions suggests that transportation providers should respond to urbanness not as a constraint, but as a context where ambidextrous strategies provide the greatest return. Our conceptual revision of urbanness offers promising future avenues of research dealing with urban complexity and logistics providers value appropriation.",Urbanness and Its Implications for Logistics Strategy: A Revised Perspective,urban logistics *** conceptual development *** logistics strategy *** urbanness,transportation journal,WOS:000586855300005,2020,0,0,0,,,
"This paper investigates the negotiation phase of industrial symbiosis relationships, where companies exchanging wastes for inputs need to develop strategies on how to share the additional costs to operate the industrial symbiosis business. The business behavior is approached as a coopetition problem where companies need to cooperate to reduce waste discharge costs and traditional input purchase costs and dive into competition to pay a minimum share of additional costs (i.e., waste treatment, waste transportation, and transaction costs) of operating industrial symbiosis. A noncooperative game-theoretical model for sharing the additional costs is proposed that highlights the two strategies that companies can adopt aimed at sharing costs: a fair strategy and an opportunistic strategy. Then, an agent-based model is used to simulate the game iterated over time and investigate how the players can adapt their strategies according to their past experience. Simulation results show that players learn that playing the fair strategy is beneficial in the long period, despite in the short period they can gain more benefit by playing the opportunistic strategy. Findings of the paper are critically important to reduce the business and managerial barriers against the formation of industrial symbiosis networks and to stimulate innovative thinking of company managers to foster the development of the circular economy. The paper proposes theoretical, managerial, and policy implications, which are discussed in detail in a comparative manner between linear and circular economy.",Learning strategic cooperative behavior in industrial symbiosis: A game-theoretic approach integrated with agent-based simulation,agent-based simulation *** circular economy *** game theory *** industrial symbiosis *** strategy management,business strategy and the environment,WOS:000525744300001,2020,0,0,0,,,

"Multi-stage resource leveling problem in sharing logistics network is a multi-objective optimization problem, which is strongly non-deterministic polynomial hard in open loop environment. In this paper, we attempt to develop a logistics task-resource allocation model for this problem, which not only considers the total cost and duration for sharing logistics network, but also refers to the resource efficiency infra-stage and stability inter-stage for resource providers. As the defects of slow convergence, weak local search and easy-to-precocious in traditional algorithms, an improved multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm is developed with adaptive neighborhood rules. The process of algorithm improvement involves: (I) an adaptive moving step size in population update strategy instead of random step size and (II) an adaptive weigh updating method with multiple neighborhood search rules in local optimum. The results show that the improved algorithm can effectively solve multi-stage resource leveling problem proposed in this paper, compared with traditional artificial bee colony algorithm, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II and multi-objective particle swarm optimization, and can obtain a better non-dominated solution set with multiple metrics for algorithm.",Multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm for multi-stage resource leveling problem in sharing logistics network,Sharing logistics network *** Multi-stage resource leveling *** Multi-objective artificial bee colony *** Adaptive neighborhood search,computers & industrial engineering,WOS:000525375800022,2020,0,0,0,,,
"Over the past years, companies started to close the loop in their supply chains to comply with the regulations and increase the sustainability of their systems. In this study, we focus on the economic and environmental effects of closing the loop in supply chains in terms of total supply chain cost and carbon emission. We consider demand, return rate and returned product quality uncertainties simultaneously and propose a set of two-stage stochastic programming models for both forward and closed-loop supply chains to compare the optimal supply chain costs, supply chain emissions and model decisions with each other. We make various sensitivity analyses to see the effects of parameters. We also study three well-known and widely-used emission policies; carbon cap, carbon cap-and-trade and carbon tax together with the case of no emission regulation and compare the forward and closed-loop supply chains under these policies. Computational results allow us to obtain important insights regarding the percentage cost difference and emission difference between forward and closed-loop supply chains in different problem settings.",Closing the loop in supply chains: Economic and environmental effects,Forward supply chain *** Closed-loop supply chain *** Emission policy *** Stochastic programming,computers & industrial engineering,WOS:000525375800042,2020,0,0,0,,,

"The selection of the delivery scheme is one of the most complicated problems and the results of its solution condition the sustainable development of the whole market of transportation services. Freight forwarders should consider numerous random parameters characterizing demand and technological processes to choose the proper structure of the logistics chain. The paper aims to propose a method for choosing the logistics chain structure, based on the analysis of the total expenses as a function from the demand parameters characterizing stochastic variables of the consignment weight, the delivery distance, and the time interval between the requests in the flow of queries for cargo delivery. Four basic logistics chain structures, widely used on road transport, are described to demonstrate the selection process. The areas of the most efficient use of the logistics chain structures can be defined for the flow of requests for cargo deliveries. The paper shows such areas on the example of goods delivery by automobile transport. Determining the areas of the most efficient use of the specific logistics chain structures contributes to the effective choice of correct delivery variants by freight forwarders.",Substantiating the Logistics Chain Structure While Servicing the Flow of Requests for Road Transport Deliveries,logistics chain structure *** total expenses *** demand parameters *** requests flow,sustainability,WOS:000522460200353,2020,0,0,0,,,
"Since natural disasters often cause the loss of lives and property, it is necessary to design a reasonable relief network to distribute relief supplies after a disaster. The shortage of relief supplies and timely transportation are the main difficulties in the whole relief network. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce a three-level humanitarian relief network design problem with resource reallocation of relief supplies. Based on the existing relief network system before a disaster, this problem determines the positions of candidate local distribution centers and points of distribution, while considering the relief distribution in the network under an uncertain post-disaster environment. For the uncertain variables, we consider a distributionally robust model with mean absolute semi-deviation (MASD) as a risk measure taken into the transportation time function. Under the partial probability distribution information of the uncertainties, we deduce a tractable framework of the distributionally robust model. Specifically, we derive the worse case form of the MASD objective under an ambiguity set and the safe approximations of the chance constraints under a box+ellipsoid+generalized budget perturbation set. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the model by a real case in Anambra flood.",A distributionally robust optimization model for designing humanitarian relief network with resource reallocation,Humanitarian relief *** Network design *** Resource reallocation *** Distributionally robust optimization *** Ambiguity set,soft computing,WOS:000518599800030,2020,0,0,0,,,
"Increased concern for the environment has led to urgent need to design the closed-loop supply chain network of hazardous products economically and ecologically. In this paper, we focus on the optimal design problem of multi-period closed-loop supply chain network of hazardous products considering uncertain demands and returns, expandable facility capacities and social acceptable risk simultaneously. In each period, the built facilities have the ability to expand within a certain scope. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model, which can determine the number, location and expansion scale of the facilities and the forward and reverse logistics quantities between the facilities in each period simultaneously. The goal is to minimize the expected cost over the multi-period planning horizon, including the facilities building, operating and expansion costs and the costs related to manufacturing, collection, processing, recovery and transportation. In order to solve the proposed model, two classes of dummy variables are introduced to equivalently transform it into a mixed-integer linear programming, which can be optimally solved by LINGO. A case study is presented to illustrate the validity of the proposed model. The dynamic design with expansion strategy addressed in this paper is compared with two different strategies of static design and dynamic design without expansion. The results highlight that the dynamic design with expansion strategy has the advantages in saving expenses and raising the average expected collection rate of hazardous wastes.",Multi-period multi-scenario optimal design for closed-loop supply chain network of hazardous products with consideration of facility expansion,Closed-loop supply chain network design *** Hazardous products *** Multiple periods *** Facility expansion,soft computing,WOS:000518599800031,2020,0,0,0,,,
"The most significant international issue affecting society and the economy today is energy. Also, addressing sustainability issues, including environmental, economic, and social issues are the main goals of governments in developing and developed countries. Therefore, it has been in the interest of governments to consider strategies that could move the energy industry, especially fuel, towards clean fuel production. In this paper, the effect of government financial interventions under the coalition of bio-refineries to achieve sustainability goals has been studied. The proposed nonlinear model aims to obtain the optimum amount of biofuel production under the conditions of the cooperation of bio-refineries and government financial interventions. On the other hand, government sustainability goals are considered as functions related to economic, social, and environmental issues. Mulvey's robust approach is employed for controlling model uncertainties. For finding the best tariff policy, the MULTIMOORA approach is used by considering sustainability considerations, and the Best-Worst Approach is followed in obtaining the weights of the criteria. Furthermore, for the best tariff policy in a general coalition, sharing the profits among the bio-refineries as players in a cooperative game, fair profit distribution methods were applied.

"Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are largely encouraged to take an open innovation model as a systematic area for R&D to expand networks in science and technology operation (Sci-Tech), especially in Thailand and China. Our paper examines the relationship between organizational culture (OC) and open innovation performance (OIP) of SMEs and the mediating effect of organizational sustainability (OS). Our investigation of 300 SMEs from different business industries in Thailand and China reveals that organizational sustainability significantly intervenes in the interaction of organizational culture and open innovation performance. From the findings, it is established that organizations should set robust and appropriate strategies for organizational sustainability to have excellent innovation outputs in SMEs' performance.

"The paper studies a closed loop supply chain (CLSC) focusing on managing, scheduling and routing problems to achieve economical and environmental sustainability. Generally, a logistic based green supply chain is studied to help multiple stakeholders. Here, we investigate the CLSC to reduce the total transportation cost including carbon emission from a heterogeneous fleet with limited capacity. The forward chain includes manufacturers, depots, distributors/collectors and customers. In the reverse chain, the distributors collect the returned items and sort into three groups through quality-screening and send them to the secondary chain facilities (emerging markets or decomposition centres) which one is fitted. This investigation is contributed by all the demonstrating issues through considering customers' demand, an extensive emission display and the vulnerability of an expanded convey of vehicles. The proposed model addresses four distinct environmental policies viz. cap, carbon tax, cap-and-purchase and cap-and-sale for carbon emission regulations. The model is formulated in the framework of mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP), and an exact approach is employed to obtain the optimal solution. The theoretical results of the model are verified through numerical examples. A comprehensive analysis is presented to monitor the rate of return products and various fleet transporting parameters.",Modelling a closed-loop supply chain with a heterogeneous fleet under carbon emission reduction policy,Closed-loop supply chain *** Transportation cost *** Carbon emission cost *** Heterogeneous fleet *** Government Regulations *** Pareto optimal solution,transportation research part e-logistics and transportation review,WOS:000513298400001,2020,0,0,0,,,
"Increasing the number of disasters around the world decreases the performance of supply chain. The decision makers should design resilient supply chain networks that can encounter disruptions. This paper develops an integrated resilient model for supplier selection and order allocation. Resilience measures including quality, delivery, technology, continuity, and environmental competences were explored for determining the Resilience Weight (RW) of suppliers. Fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Analytic Network Process (ANP) methods were applied to finding the overall performance of each supplier. Then, the developed mathematical model maximized the overall performance of suppliers while minimizing total cost of network. The proposed mathematical model helps the decision makers to select supplier and allocate the optimum order quantities by considering shortage. Since the disruptive incidents are inevitable events in real-world problems, the impact of disruptions on suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers has been considered in the proposed model. Inherent uncertainties of parameters were taken into account to increase the compatibility of the approach with realistic environments. To tackle the uncertainty and multi-objectiveness of the proposed model, interval method and TH aggregation function were adapted. The proposed model was validated through its application to a real case study of a furniture company. Results demonstrated usefulness and applicability of the proposed model.

"Asset allocation is a critical concern for any investor in the financial market. This paper aims to prioritize five randomly selected firms from the top ten stocks by market capitalization of the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) by opting for adequate financial procedures and practical criteria under uncertain conditions. Decision makers want not only the ranking order of stocks but also capital proportions to be allocated. Therefore, this study uses a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach comprising of an integrated analytic network process (ANP) and decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) in a grey environment for optimal portfolio selection to provide both ranking and weighting information for decision makers. Results indicate that return, financial ratios, dividends, and risk are causal criteria group, which are the most influential determinants for obtaining high benefits with regards to stock portfolio selection in SSE. The free float of stocks is the least influencing criterion among all identified criteria of stock portfolio selection of SSE. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd. stocks have the highest allocated proportion with the highest priority shown by investors and can be described as a suitable alternative. The practical implications of this research are that the approach, when applied, highlights how the grey system theory minimizes the uncertainties in all stages of decision-making of portfolio selection.",A HYBRID GREY MCDM APPROACH FOR ASSET ALLOCATION: EVIDENCE FROM CHINA'S SHANGHAI STOCK EXCHANGE,asset allocation *** grey MCDM *** grey-ANP *** grey-DEMATEL *** Shanghai Stock Exchange *** China,journal of business economics and management,WOS:000526073500007,2020,0,0,0,,,
"Remanufacturing has now become one of the effective strategies for reducing the negative impact on the environment by prolonging the products' life cycle in the automotive sector. Still considered as a relatively new industry in Malaysia, the low remanufacturing rate coupled with the lack of standardization are thus seen as causing a high inclination of disruption occurrences in the remanufacturing operations. As such, this paper had identified and investigated the existing disruptions in four problematic areas, namely the production planning, infrastructure facilities, distribution networking and inventory management of the automotive remanufacturing firms in Malaysia. From the SPSS analysis and calculation of the mean and standard deviation values on the semi-structured interviews that were conducted in three remanufacturing companies, the highest contributor to the disruption risks was found to have resulted from the difficulty in obtaining the spare parts components in the production planning process. By also exploring the awareness level on environmental sustainability and the significance of remanufacturing processes among the remanufacturer companies, this analysis is thus deemed useful for not only identifying suitable actions that can be taken for mitigating the various risks faced by the automotive remanufacturers in Malaysia, but also in solving the disruptions of the remanufacturing supply chain system.",Analysis of the Supply Chain Disruption Risks in the Malaysian Automotive Remanufacturing Industry- a Case Study,remanufacturing *** uncertainties *** semi-structured *** case study *** Malaysia,international journal of integrated engineering,WOS:000558700400001,2020,1,1,1,,,
"We investigate the interrelations of structural and operational vulnerabilities in the supply chain (SC) using discrete-event simulation for a real life case study. We theorise a notion of SC overlays and explore conditions surrounding their appearance. Such overlays occur if the negative consequences of changes in a SC structure as a result of a disruption are either amplified or mitigated by changes in the operational environment. We hypothesise that these overlays can be both reciprocal (i.e. complementary or mitigating) and aggravate (i.e. concurrent or enhancing). Our approach can be used for an efficient management of SC resilience capabilities by varying their levels over time. We show different ripple and bullwhip effect profiles, which lead to either reciprocal or aggravate overlays, and then we develop recommendations on the overlay-driven dynamic variation of resilience capability levels in order to enhance both SC resilience and efficiency through dynamic redundancy allocation. The results can be of value in selecting and deploying operational policies at the right time and scale during and after the recovery periods. Restricting analysis to the disruption period only and ignoring operational dynamics after capacity recovery can result in misleading or inefficient SC resilience and recovery policies.",'A blessing in disguise' or 'as if it wasn't hard enough already': reciprocal and aggravate vulnerabilities in the supply chain,Supply chain dynamics *** supply chain engineering *** supply chain resilience *** supply chain risk management *** simulation applications *** ripple effect,international journal of production research,WOS:000559798100003,2020,1,1,,,,
"Supply chain networks have grown in complexity and size due to increased globalization leading to a variety of challenges and opportunities for improvement. Optimizing inventory levels and adjusting replenishment policies have significant effects on the operational performance and profitability of supply chains. Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) is a mutually beneficial arrangement between supplier and buyer, where the supplier is responsible for making inventory and replenishment decisions based on buyers' inventory status. Potential benefits of VMI include reducing inventories, enabling information sharing, eliminating safety stock, and reducing purchasing related costs across the supply chain. In today's supply chains, VMI operations face critical challenges related to data integrity, transparency, traceability, and single point of failure due to its centralized architecture. Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger that ensures a transparent, safe, and secure exchange of data among supply chain stakeholders. The advantages of adopting blockchain technology for VMI operations in a supply chain include decentralized control, security, traceability, and auditable time-stamped transactions. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based approach using smart contracts to transform VMI supply chain operations. We propose a generic framework using Ethereum smart contracts and decentralized storage systems to automate the processes and information exchange and detailed algorithms that capture the interactions among supply chain stakeholders. The smart contract code was developed and tested in Remix environment. We present cost and security analysis incurred by the stakeholders in the supply chain. Adopting a blockchain-based solution to VMI operations in supply chains is economically viable and provides a streamlined, secure, trusted, and transparent mode of communication among various stakeholders.",Enhancing Vendor Managed Inventory Supply Chain Operations Using Blockchain Smart Contracts,Supply chains *** Stakeholders *** Contracts *** Planning *** Data integrity *** Blockchain applications *** Ethereum *** smart contracts *** security *** data integrity *** supply chain management,ieee access,WOS:000577879000001,2020,0,0,0,,,
"Medical Supply chain network design is one of the crucial planning problems that if solved efficiently and effectively, can alleviate the dangers arising from the accumulation of wastes. Furthermore, the harmful effects of medical waste, with their infectious nature in the environment, have increased justifies the significance of this research. In this article, forward and reverse supply chain network design for consumer medical products is considered taking into account the biological risks. The proposed model has two objectives: first, maximizing the profit obtained from subtracting the costs from the revenues of the supply chain. Revenues are gained from selling medical supplies to hospitals and medical wastes to recycling centers, as well as getting the permission to use sterilize services from clinics lacking a sterilization center. The costs include activation cost of inventory, sterilization and collection centers, transportation cost, purchasing cost of medical supplies, municipality cost for destruction of medical waste, etc. The second objective is to reduce biological risks. The primary source of infectious medical supplies is from disposable supplies and equipment. Thus, the second objective function is to minimize the distance and travel time between the clinic and the sterilization center. The proposed model is implemented in hospitals in Tehran's 4th municipal district using the Bounded De Novo Programming approach which initially attempts to redesign rare sources of the problem. The issue has two types of resource and policy constraints. The policy constraints of the problem cannot be changed, which is why the bounded De Novo Programming approach is used to solve the problem. Redesigning the capacity of the sterilization center leads to the decrease of biological risks, and in addition to can causes to increasing profitability. Also, by raising the productivity of medical waste in the recycling process, the distribution center can receive more profits.",Forward and reverse supply chain network design for consumer medical supplies considering biological risk,Supply chain network design *** Healthcare *** Medical waste *** Bounded De Novo Programming,computers & industrial engineering,WOS:000515417800026,2020,0,0,0,,,
"Aim. The ratification of the Paris Agreement by Ukraine envisages an increase in the ability to adapt to the negative effects of climate change, as well as promoting low carbon development so as not to endanger food production. At the same time, water resources, on the one hand, are one of the most vulnerable to climate change components of the environment from the state of which the food security of the country depends directly, and on the other hand, the activity of the water management complex causes the emergence of both direct and indirect carbon footprint. Therefore, an indispensable prerequisite for sustainable low carbon development is the assessment of the carbon footprint of the main sectors of Ukraine's water management complex and the identification of priority measures for their decarbonisation and adaptation to expected climate change. Methods. The methodological basis for the assessment of the carbon footprint of the main sectors of the water management complex was the life cycle method (LCA), by which, based on the open data of the National Inventory of Anthropogenic Emissions from Sources and Absorption by Greenhouse Gas Absorbers in Ukraine and the statistical analysis of the results of previous studies. By means of systematic analysis of the main factors of greenhouse gas emission in the water management complex of Ukraine, the priority directions of its decarbonisation and adaptation to climate change were determined. Results. The estimated carbon footprint of Ukraine's water complex in 2017 was estimated to be 5.15 million tons of CO2-equiv, which was 1.6% of the total greenhouse gas emissions in Ukraine in 2017, and taking into account the potential carbon footprint end-use processes can be increased by up to 3%. Due to the deterioration of the water supply networks, an average of 35% of the supplied water is lost in Ukraine. Reducing network leakage by at least 10% will reduce carbon footprint by 30,000 tons of CO2-equiv annually. The priority areas for decarbonisation of the water management complex should be modernization of water supply and water treatment infrastructure, improvement of energy efficiency of pumping equipment and introduction of drip irrigation, and its adaptation to climate change development of the network of green infrastructure. Conclusions. The low-carbon development of the water management system should include the introduction and coordination of such measures, which, on the one hand, minimize the adverse effects of climate change on water resources and contribute to reducing the carbon footprint of water management activities, and on the other hand, guarantee the achievement of sustainable development goals, in particular for ensuring water and society proper sanitary conditions.",CURRENT TRENDS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WATER MANAGEMENT COMPLEX: UKRAINIAN REALITIES AND INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE,carbon footprint *** water management complex *** adaptation *** decarbonisation *** climate change,baltic journal of economic studies,WOS:000619581000024,2020,0,0,0,,,
"Given energy and water scarcity, it is necessary to develop an in-depth understanding of the energy-water nexus in China for its sustainable development. Previous studies have focused on nexus accounting, synergy conservation, and system optimization, but its induction mechanism along the supply chains has not been uncovered. This paper proposes a top-down structural path analysis (SPA) and combines it with an environmental input-output model (EIOM) to identify the critical final demand, consumption sectors, and supply chain paths inducing the energy-water nexus. The results show that the largest final demand of water for energy production (WFE) is capital formation, while the largest final demand of energy for water supply (EFW) is urban consumption. The distribution of WFE at different production layers shows an inverted U shape. Most WFE is indirectly consumed by other sectors, such as construction, through three-step supply chain paths. In contrast, the distribution of EFW shows a L shape, and most EFW is directly consumed by the final demand. In addition, some critical supply chain paths inducing more WFE and EFW are identified. Finally, some policies targeting the energy-water nexus management are proposed, which are conducive to resource conservation and the sustainable supply of energy and water.",What Induces the Energy-Water Nexus in China's Supply Chains?, ,environmental science & technology,WOS:000506723200040,2020,0,0,0,,,
"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to propose that a firm could exploit the ties of interfirm network to access external network resources (NR) to assist its sensing and responding capabilities for the variability of business environment, thereby leading to superior organizational performance.

"With the growing level of public environmental consciousness, sustainability has become an important issue in the area of supply chain management. This paper focuses on a channel coordination problem in a two-echelon sustainable supply chain involving one socially responsible manufacturer and one fairminded retailer. Constructing mathematical models to characterize the problem, four particular contracts are developed to investigate the environmental performance and channel profit under the framework of two non-cooperative contracts: wholesale price and two-part tariff, and two cooperative contracts: Nash bargaining and Rubinstein bargaining. Theoretical analysis verified by numerical experiments shows that the wholesale price contract performs worse than the other three in terms of the carbon emission per unit product and channel profit. In addition, the two-part tariff contract can partially coordinate the supply chain, whereas both bargaining contracts can achieve perfect coordination to provide outcomes of the centralized decision. Comparing with the fair-neutral scenarios, we find that the fairness behavior promotes the retailer's profit, but reduces the manufacturer's profit under different contracts. Sensitivity analysis reveals that with intensified fairness concerns, the sustainability level and channel profit diminish under non-cooperative contracts, but remain the same under cooperative contracts. The Nash bargaining and Rubinstein bargaining contracts are robust to the degree of the retailer's fairness behavior and could be the best choice for the socially responsible manufacturer.

"The bullwhip effect (BWE) is a phenomenon, which is caused by ineffective inventory decisions made by supply chain members. In addition to known inefficiencies caused by the bullwhip effect within a supply chain product flow, such as excessive inventory, it can also lead to inefficiencies in cash flow such as the cash flow bullwhip (CFB). The CFB reduces the efficiency of the supply chain (SC) through heterogeneous distribution of cash among supply chain members. This paper aims to decrease both the BWE and the CFB across a SC through applying a simulation-based optimisation approach, which integrates system dynamics (SD) simulation and genetic algorithms. For this purpose, cash flow modelling is incorporated into the SD structure of the beer distribution game (BG) to develop the CFB function. A multi objective optimisation model is then integrated with the SD-BG simulation model. Finally, a genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to determine the optimal values for the inventory, supply line, and financial decision parameters. Results show that the proposed integrated framework leads to efficient liquidity management in the SC in addition to cost management.",Using simulation-based system dynamics and genetic algorithms to reduce the cash flow bullwhip in the supply chain,supply chain management *** artificial intelligence *** simulation *** genetic algorithms and the bullwhip effect,international journal of production research,WOS:000508536400001,2020,,,,,,

The authors investigated nine FPIs that were selected from the financial statements of 155 companies within nine industries from 2011 to 2017 using Morningstar financial database and Gartner's report. The authors find that suitable FPIs to measure SCC for shareholders' value are return-on-assets (ROA), days-sales-outstanding (DSO), and current ratio (CR). This means that higher ROA, shortened DSO, and an appropriate level of CR could reach a sustainable supply chain.

"Bioenergy is one of the alternatives to secure energy demand, despite increasing debate on the sustainability of using bioenergy as a renewable source. As the source is disseminated over a large area and affected by seasonality, the potential benefit is highly dependent on other cost and benefit trade-offs along the supply chain. This review paper aims to assess operational management research methods used in biofuel supply chain planning, including both upstream production and international downstream trading. There have been considerable operational management studies done on upstream processes in biofuel production based on different strategic and tactical decision making of a single or multiple feedstocks, considering economic and environmental factor. However, the environmental consideration is often limited to carbon emission where the other environmental impact such as land-use change, biodiversity loss, irrigation and fertilisation are often being overlooked. Biofuel supply chain and trading at international level remain as an apparent research potential where only limited numbers of global energy models explicitly simulate international bioenergy trade. The leading biofuel producing countries in Southeast Asia: Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, are selected as a case study to investigate further on how the supply chain management model could be applied considering the existing biofuel support policies. This study is expected to contribute to the selection of operational management research methods used for decision making under robust policy context, followed by several recommendations.",Operational Management Implemented in Biofuel Upstream Supply Chain and Downstream International Trading: Current Issues in Southeast Asia,biofuel *** bioenergy *** supply chain *** Malaysia *** Indonesia *** Thailand *** interdisciplinary *** integrated assessment,energies,WOS:000537688400268,2020,,,,,,
"Global change, that results from population growth, global warming and land use change (especially rapid urbanization), is directly affecting the complexity of water resources management problems and the uncertainty to which they are exposed. Both, the complexity and the uncertainty, are the result of dynamic interactions between multiple system elements within three major systems: (i) the physical environment; (ii) the social environment; and (iii) the constructed infrastructure environment including pipes, roads, bridges, buildings, and other components. Recent trends in dealing with complex water resources systems include consideration of the whole region being affected, explicit incorporation of all costs and benefits, development of a large number of alternative solutions, and the active (early) involvement of all stakeholders in the decision-making. Systems approaches based on simulation, optimization, and multi-objective analyses, in deterministic, stochastic and fuzzy forms, have demonstrated in the last half of last century, a great success in supporting effective water resources management. This paper explores the future opportunities that will utilize advancements in systems theory that might transform management of water resources on a broader scale. The paper presents performance-based water resources engineering as a methodological framework to extend the role of the systems approach in improved sustainable water resources management under changing conditions (with special consideration given to rapid climate destabilization).

"Sustainable distribution network design for the maintenance components of electric multiple units (EMUs) is critical to reduce the problem of unreasonable resource allocation and capital occupation of high-speed railway (HSR) operations. Motivated by the above analysis, this study investigates the integrated optimization of the location and inventory of EMU maintenance component distributions. Aiming to improve the sustainable operation for high-speed railway, we proposed a corresponding nonlinear mixed-integer programming model to determine the location of the distribution center (DC) for EMU maintenance component delivery, inventory control strategy, and corresponding service level. The above optimization model is solved by an adaptive improved genetic algorithm. The proposed model and algorithm are applied to a real-world case study on China's EMU maintenance components. The findings show that a higher service level is not better to achieve the lower total cost in the maintenance component distribution network. The ratios of transportation modes are significant to balance the service level and total cost of the EMU distribution network. Furthermore, the unit out-of-stock cost and the service level both show great impacts on the total costs of the EMU distribution system. Finally, there exists an optimal ratio of different transport modes, which ensures the least total cost of the EMU distribution system.",Integrated Optimization of the Location-Inventory Problem of Maintenance Component Distribution for High-Speed Railway Operations,distribution network design *** maintenance components of high-speed railway *** location-inventory problem *** optimization model *** adaptive genetic algorithm *** case study,sustainability,WOS:000550235300001,2020,,,,,,

"Nowadays, preferred compromise response of renewable energies' demands regarding the candidate sustainable feedstocks is a crucial issue for market change management. Thus, selecting the most suitable sustainable feedstock is a key factor for optimum renewable products allocation problem. To address the issue, this study proposes a hybrid adaptive framework based on consensus evaluation approach, weighting and ranking procedure, and preferred demand assignment under dynamic hesitant fuzzy sets. In this respect, the consensus evaluation approach is tailored regarding the direct and indirect feedback mechanisms to enhance the quality evaluation of candidate sustainable feedstocks under assessment criteria. Thereby, the weight of each criterion is determined based on the developed dynamic hesitant fuzzy entropy method and the candidate sustainable feedstocks are ranked with respect to developed dynamic hesitant fuzzy positive and negative ideal solutions. Then, a revised multi-choice goal programming model is extended regarding the dynamic hesitant fuzzy closeness indexes to attend to preferred compromise response of demand centers by optimum renewable products allocation. Meanwhile, the presented hybrid adaptive framework is implemented to a real case study to represent the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is provided by defining eight comparison indexes to compare the obtained results with two recent studies in relevant literature for representing the validation and verification of the proposed approach. The comparative analysis shows that the proposed approach versus the two other approaches has merits such as modeling of uncertainty, experts' weights, adaptive structure, unanimous agreement-based approach, and last aggregation framework. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is represented to show the sensitiveness and robustness of the obtained results from changing the criteria weights, goals values, and consensus elimination.

"Concerns about the environment, public health, and safety are driving governments around the world to restrict access to their markets of products, which may present environmental/health risks. As a result, legislation in many countries requires that firms comply with specific environmental and safety standards before introducing their products in these markets. However, there is no unified global standard, and a set of local rules governs most of the markets. Therefore, products complying with the regulations of one market may not be compliant with the standards laid out in the other. This means that large firms must include the local regulatory requirements of their targeted markets into account when making their sourcing decisions. The rise in the enforcement of compliance legislation has overlapped with an increase in the trend of global sourcing, where manufacturers have opted for a diversified and offshore supplier base. With the issue of compliance legislation in place, the suppliers who otherwise would produce functionally identical products become differentiable based on their ability to fulfill compliance requirements of the targeted markets. Also, the suppliers have incentives to exaggerate their compliance ability or may lack the technical capability to ascertain this information completely. Therefore, there always resides a degree of uncertainty about a supplier's actual compliance capability. On the market side, there is uncertainty concerning product demand in individual markets. These two sources of uncertainty make this a rather challenging problem. We propose a formulation of supplier selection and product allocation decisions in this problem based on a two-stage robust optimization method. Through a set of numerical experiments, we discuss some exciting insights about the role of uncertainty in compliance failure on overall profitability and flexibility in the supply chain. We show that 3% supply-side uncertainty has almost the same effect on the quality of worst-case profit as 30% deviation from the nominal demand.

"Organic food has important environmental and health benefits, decreasing the toxicity of agricultural production, improving soil quality, and overall resilience of farming. Increasing consumers' demand for organic food reinforces the rate of organic farming adoption and the level of farmers' risk acceptance. Despite the recorded 20% growth in organically managed farmland, its global land area is still far less than expected, only 1.4%. Increasing demand for organic food is an important pathway towards sustainable food systems. We explore this consumer-centric approach by developing a theoretically- and empirically-grounded agent-based model. Three behavioral theories - theory of planned behavior, alphabet theory, and goal-framing - describe individual food purchasing decisions in response to policies. We take wine sector as an example to calibrate and validate the model for the case study of Sydney, Australia. The discrepancy between consumer intention and purchasing behavior for organic wine can be explained by a locked-in vicious cycle. We assess the effectiveness of different policies such as wine taxation, and informational-education campaigns to influence consumer choices. The model shows that these interventions are non-additive: raising consumer awareness and increasing tax on less environmentally friendly wines simultaneously is more successful in promoting organic wine than the sum of the two policies introduced separately. The phenomenon of undercover altruism amplifies the preference for organic wine, and the upping point occurs at around 35% diffusion rate in the population. This research suggests policy implications to help decision-makers in the food sector make informed decisions about organic markets.",Exploring consumer behavior and policy options in organic food adoption: Insights from the Australian wine sector,Sustainable food *** Organic agriculture *** Social interactions *** Behavioral theory *** Consumption pattern *** Complex systems,environmental science & policy,WOS:000534365100012,2020,,,,,,
"A sustainable and reliable power system is extremely important to ensure the prosperity of a country and its society. Traditional power systems are facing serious environmental and social issues while renewable energy systems possess low reliability due to the intermittent nature of energy sources. This paper addresses the sustainable and reliable power system design problem in an uncertain environment by using an approach called multi-objective fuzzy robust programming. The proposed approach, which is an integration of robust programming and two main branches of fuzzy programming (possibilistic and flexible programming), solves the presented multi-objective problem by simultaneously improving both sustainability and reliability, as well as by capturing uncertain factors. The objective is to determine the optimal number, location, capacity, and technology of the generation units as well as the electricity generated and transmitted through the network while minimizing the sustainability and reliability costs of the system. The proposed model considers uncertainties in the demand, the intermittent nature of renewable energy resources, and cost parameters. A case study in Vietnam was conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed model. Results show that the proposed model improves the total cost of the power system, including sustainability and reliability costs, by approximately 4.2% and reduces the computational time by 20% compared to the scenario-based stochastic programming approach. Our findings also show that due to risk disruption, the reliability cost of the power system increases to 56.72% when more electric power is generated. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The sustainable model minimises CO(2)emissions from transportation and total costs incurred in facilities and the transportation channels. Design of Experiment (DoE) is integrated to the meta-heuristic based optimiser to solve the model in two phases. The DoE-guided solution approach enables the optimiser to offer the best stable solution space by taking out solutions with poor design features from the space and refining the feasible solutions using a convergence algorithm thereby selecting the realistic results. Several alternative solution scenarios are obtained by prioritising and ranking the realistic solution sets through a multi-attribute decision analysis tool, Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The robust model provides the decision maker the ability to take decisions on sustainable open alternative optimal routes. The outcomes of this research provide theoretical and methodological contributions, in terms of integrated bi-objective location-routing model and its two-phase DoE-guided meta-heuristic solution approach, for the distribution side of three-echelon logistics networks.",Sustainable distribution system design: a two-phase DoE-guided meta-heuristic solution approach for a three-echelon bi-objective AHP-integrated location-routing model,Sustainable logistics network *** Location-routing *** Bi-objective programming *** Mixed-integer programming *** Multi-attribute decision analysis *** DoE-guided meta-heuristic solution,annals of operations research,WOS:000543166000009,2020,,,,,,
"Returned used products vary widely in terms of their condition. For large used machinery, restoration processes are divided into reuse, remanufacture, recycle (3R) based on their condition. To quantify the environmental impacts of the 3R processing arising from the quality uncertainty of returns, this study presents a model that analyzes the carbon footprint at different processing nodes, and then establishes a quantitative relationship between environmental indexes and processing quantities at these nodes. Also, the overall condition of the returned cores can be directly reflected by processing quantities. As opposed to passive assessment, we then derive two optimal strategies to maximize the environmental benefit under different acquisition scenarios using stochastic analysis of the quantity distribution. The results, which were grounded with the data of engine remanufacturing, illustrate that prioritizing higher quality returns is not necessarily the best strategy. Rather, there exists an optimal overall quality coefficient that can maximize the comprehensive benefit of remanufacturing. Which provides the theoretical basis for managers to devise optimal acquisition strategy for maximal production efficiency with lower energy and resource input. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

"Purpose This paper draws on the perspective of social networks to examine when 3PLs initiate low-carbon supply chain integration (LCSCI) in decarbonising supply chains. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was conducted on a sample of 348 Chinese 3PLs. Stepwise regression was adopted to analyse the data. Findings It is found that LCSCI has a positive effect on firm performance. From the social network perspective, a larger scope of outsourcing increases 3PLs' embeddedness, which increases their chance of success in initiating LCSCI, especially for 3PLs with higher decarbonisation capabilities. Interestingly, although the pressure from government regulation can also motivate LCSCI, it is less effective for 3PLs with higher decarbonisation capabilities because they can be too embedded in the network to freely adapt to regulations. Research limitations/implications This study has investigated 3PL-initiated LCSCI only from the view of 3PLs. A dyadic approach which includes the perception of customers would be desirable. Practical implications The results highlight the critical role of 3PLs as supply chain orchestrators in decarbonising supply chains, and the effectiveness of LCSCI as a competitive strategy of 3PLs. Coercive pressures from government regulations are not constraints but resources for 3PLs in initiating LCSCI, especially in markets where the 3PLs have insufficient decarbonisation capabilities. Originality/value This study contributes to theories on 3PLs' interorganizational low-carbon initiatives, LCSCI, and the paradox of social networks in supply chains.",When do 3PLs initiate low-carbon supply chain integration?,3PLs *** Low-carbon supply chain integration *** Supply chain management *** Social network perspective,international journal of operations & production management,WOS:000539571200001,2020,,,,,,
"Medical waste generation is rapidly rising, which may cause a serious risk for both humans and environment if it is not properly managed. Designing an efficient and reliable medical waste reverse supply chain (MWRSC) is extremely beneficial to society. Most studies on this issue have only considered the generated waste and have not reported the uncertainty in the amount of medical waste generation and other MWRSC parameters. Sustainability criteria and environmental issues in choosing treatment technology are rarely considered as well. In this research, a linear programming model under uncertainty is developed to design an MWRSC. The proposed model is multi-item and multi-period with three objective functions. The first objective function minimizes total costs, the second objective function is relevant to the best treatment technology selection and the third objective function minimizes the total medical waste stored. A robust possibilistic programming approach is utilized to handle imprecise parameters in the model and a fuzzy goal programming method is employed to build up a multi-objective model. A real case study is conducted to illustrate the potential of the proposed model which involves different attributes and problems, such as the location and capacity of facilities, and the type of treatment technology. Furthermore, the transferring amount of medical waste among different nodes is calculated. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

"The risk created by government policymaking can be daunting, but little is known about the extent to which this risk is disruptive to business in general and to supply chain operations in particular. Because government is a powerful and omnipresent entity, scholars and executives alike could benefit from greater understanding of how firms react to risk emanating from the policymaking process. To help address this gap, we use resource dependence theory to develop hypotheses concerning the accumulation of inventory by firms to buffer against their exposure to potential policy changes and how such a link might be moderated by macro-level and industry-level factors. Data from 19,634 firm-year observations reveal that firms accumulate more inventory as a buffer against policy risk under conditions of high policy uncertainty and high industry dynamism. Overall, our findings support the predictions of resource dependence theory and refine understanding of supply chain responses to macro-level uncertainty by demonstrating the contingent influence of government policy. In doing so, our study provides a foundation for future research to explore the intersections between government actions and supply chain activities and offers insights for managers and policymakers about how to factor government into their decision calculi.","The Implications of Firm-Specific Policy Risk, Policy Uncertainty, and Industry Factors for Inventory: A Resource Dependence Perspective",supply chain strategy *** policy and regulation *** uncertainty *** panel econometrics *** resource dependence theory *** inventory,journal of supply chain management,WOS:000548376200001,2020,,,,,,
"The green supply chain management (GSCM) is an enterprise's effort to protect the environment and a key way to achieve sustainable environmental development. On the contrary, globalization brings more risks to the supply chain. Resilience has become a critical definition in supply chain management to help enterprises review the disruption and return to normal state. Therefore, choosing a resilient-green supplier to build a supply chain environment with flexibility and greenness under interruption becomes necessary for research works. However, the existing studies tended to focus on only one of the factors with resilience and greenness, and no comprehensive criteria system and performance value is expressed by a crisp number. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid method which integrates the Best-Worst method (BWM), Weighted Aggregated Sum-Product Assessment (WASPAS), and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to solve the critical problems. Firstly, BWM is used to weigh the criteria; secondly, intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are introduced into the ranking stage. Then, the integrated WASPAS and TOPSIS are used to rank the alternatives to select the optimal resilient-green supplier. Finally, an illustrative example proves the feasibility of this method.","An Approach for Resilient-Green Supplier Selection Based on WASPAS, BWM, and TOPSIS under Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets", ,mathematical problems in engineering,WOS:000559318400011,2020,,,,,,
"In order to achieve the actual inventory effectively tracking the target inventory under uncertain environment, this paper investigates an adaptive inventory controller for the production-inventory system. First, an uncertain production-inventory model is constructed, and then, the uncertainty of the production-inventory model is approximated by a fuzzy neural network. Secondly, in terms of the design of adaptive control law, the adaptive inventory controller is developed. Under the adaptive inventory controller, the actual inventory can track the target inventory in real time and the production-inventory system can be robustly stable in uncertain environment. Finally, the results of three simulation experiments show that the proposed adaptive inventory controller can realize both the fast tracking speed and the high tracking accuracy.",Adaptive Inventory Control Based on Fuzzy Neural Network under Uncertain Environment, ,complexity,WOS:000561307600005,2020,,,,,,
"This study proposes a robust optimization model to configure a wastewater treatment network requiring for the shale gas production. In Alberta (a province of Canada), the government of Alberta supervises this operation based on regulatory framework and environmental standards. On this matter, there are a variety of uncertain parameters (i.e., fixed and variable costs of wastewater treatment, required amount of water, and capacities of facilities) in this facility location problem. An integrated robust flexible stochastic model is developed to consider multiple sources of uncertainty. Simulation is conducted to analyze the robustness of the proposed model. To eliminate carbon emissions as a result of the operation and transportation, the mathematical model is extended to a multi-objective model. Non-dominated solutions of the multi-objective model are obtained by a new iterative approach.

"Leftovers of medications, which have not been disposed adequately in the pharmaceutical industry, cause damage to the environment and may become hazardous to people's health as well. On the contrary, returning unexpired medications pharmaceutical producer can make a chance to sell unexpired items at reduced prices or distribute them to developed countries. Here, the customer's role and customer's suggested price are considered that can be as an incentive to customers in order to corporate on collecting returned items in order to promote remaining returns and make better sustainability for a Reverse Supply Chain (RSC) in pharmaceutical industry.

"Today, in many organizations, the debate about the difference in core capabilities has become an important factor for market competition. Companies, based on the field of activity, decide to strengthen some of their capabilities, capacities, and expertise. Therefore, the focus of an organization on the strengths and efforts to develop its sustainability will lead to a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Due to changes in environmental factors, organizations have focused on carbon emissions in procurement and transportation that have the highest carbon footprint. This paper proposes a multiobjective, eco-sustainability model for a supply chain. The objectives are to minimize overall costs, maximize the efficiency of transportation vehicles and minimize information fraud in the process of information sharing within supply chain elements. Big data is considered in the amount of information exchanged between customers and other elements of the proposed supply chain; since there are frauds in information sharing then using big data 5Vs the model is adapted to control the cost of information loss leading to customer dissatisfaction. Since uncertainty is inevitable in the real environments, in this research hybrid uncertainty is considered. Because two sources of uncertainty are considered in most of the parameters, thus it is necessary to robustify the decision-making process. The model is a mixed integer nonlinear program including big data for an optimal sustainable procurement and transportation decision. A heuristic method is used to solve the big data problem that makes use of a robust fuzzy stochastic programming approach. The proposed model can prevent disturbances by using a scenario-based stochastic programming approach. An effective hybrid robust fuzzy stochastic method is also employed for controlling uncertainty in parameters and risk taking out of outbound decisions. To solve the multi-objective model, augmented epsilon-constraint method is utilized. The model performance is investigated in a comprehensive computational study. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

"Emerging issues and new challenges of globalization have forced companies to design their supply chains for not only minimizing cost but also considering other factors. Supply chains are exposed to new environmental regulations to reduce their carbon emissions and compelled to consider other overlooked factors, such as risk. In this paper, we consider a multi-echelon multimodal supply chain network design problem with multiple products and components that take economic, environmental and risk factors into account. The problem is modeled as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming model and constrained by a carbon cap-and-trade scheme and a risk threshold. This novel problem realistically portrays the supply chain network design considering sustainability and reliability factors simultaneously. The proposed model has been tested on randomly generated hypothetical but realistic test instances. The impacts of different risk thresholds and unit carbon prices on the supply chain cost, risk and emissions are analyzed. The effects of multimodal transportation modes on cost, risk and emissions are also tested. Results prove that using multimodal transportation decreases supply chain cost and carbon emission. In addition, the total supply chain cost and carbon emission increase if the decision maker is risk-averse. The choice of transportation modes is sensitive only to emission levels.","Sustainable, multimodal and reliable supply chain design",Supply chain design *** Sustainability *** Supply chain risk *** Multimodal transportation *** Mixed integer linear programming,annals of operations research,WOS:000538350700002,2020,,,,,,
"In the design of the supply chain, the use of the returned products and their recycling in the production and consumption network is called reverse logistics. The proposed model aims to optimize the flow of materials in the supply chain network (SCN), and determine the amount and location of facilities and the planning of transportation in conditions of demand uncertainty. Thus, maximizing the total profit of operation, minimizing adverse environmental effects, and maximizing customer and supplier service levels have been considered as the main objectives. Accordingly, finding symmetry (balance) among the profit of operation, the environmental effects and customer and supplier service levels is considered in this research. To deal with the uncertainty of the model, scenario-based robust planning is employed alongside a meta-heuristic algorithm (NSGA-II) to solve the model with actual data from a case study of the steel industry in Iran. The results obtained from the model, solving and validating, compared with actual data indicated that the model could optimize the objectives seamlessly and determine the amount and location of the necessary facilities for the steel industry more appropriately.",Robust Multi-Objective Sustainable Reverse Supply Chain Planning: An Application in the Steel Industry,multi-objective planning *** reverse supply chain *** robust optimization *** uncertainty *** meta-heuristic algorithm *** steel making industry,symmetry-basel,WOS:000540222200105,2020,,,,,,
"Many companies are struggling to manage their production systems due to increasing market uncertainty. While emerging 'smart' technologies such as the internet of things, machine learning, and cloud computing have been touted as having the potential to transform production management, the realities of their adoption and use have been much more challenging than anticipated. In this paper, we explore these challenges and present a conceptual model, a use-case matrix and a product-process framework for a smart production planning and control (smart PPC) system and illustrate the use of these artefacts through four case companies. The presented model adopts an incremental approach that companies with limited resources could employ in improving their PPC process in the context of industry 4.0 and sustainability. The results reveal that while make-to-order companies are more likely to derive greater benefits from a smart product strategy, make-to-stock companies are more likely to derive the most benefit from pursuing a smart process strategy, and consequently a smart PPC solution.","Smart Production Planning and Control: Concept, Use-Cases and Sustainability Implications",production planning and control *** smart manufacturing *** internet of things *** machine learning *** industry 4 *** 0 *** case study,sustainability,WOS:000537476200289,2020,,,,,,
"Disposing food waste in landfills leads to significant greenhouse gas emissions and lost economic and environmental resources, motivating the need for alternative treatment processes to convert waste to energy and value-added products. Developing the networks and infrastructure required to make these processes economically viable depends on high quality information about the volume and characteristics of food waste requiring treatment. Traditionally, food waste generation estimates have come from limited empirical studies and theoretical tools that predict the volume of food waste that will result from different types and intensities of economic activity. Resulting estimations are quick and don't require extensive investment to collect, but only provide single, static snapshots of expected waste generation. In reality, however, food waste would vary depending on the season, geography, and type and magnitude of the waste generating activity. This study provides an analysis of this potential variability using empirical data from commercial and institutional food waste generators in New York State and a publicly available database of food waste estimates. Results show that 57 % of food waste generated within the region comes from only 4 % of commercial facilities. Moreover, statewide generation varies monthly by approximately 37 % and significantly across different regions due to concentrations of facility locations. Study findings underscore how policy or facility siting decisions based on a single, static food waste estimation may not capture the full complexity of food waste management. Future work can improve common estimation approaches and methods for collecting empirical data to support robust policy.",Variability in commercial and institutional food waste generation and implications for sustainable management systems,Food waste *** Generation estimates *** Variability *** Geospatial *** Policy implications,resources conservation and recycling,WOS:000540558400010,2020,,,,,,
"Hazardous waste management is a hierarchical process. In the upper level of the hierarchy, the government's policies on planning and controlling the waste management infrastructure aim to overcome the environmental concerns related to the disposal of waste materials. On the other hand, the follower of the hierarchical process decides about waste collection plans considering the government-approved infrastructure to minimize total operational costs. From this point of view, the present study proposes a bi-level mathematical formulation to model the problem of hazardous waste management. Also, to tackle the highly fluctuating nature of hazardous waste generation rates, our study addresses the most probable, optimistic and pessimistic scenarios of this key parameter. To solve the problem under uncertainty, a multi-part solution methodology combining the robust optimization approach, a method of reformulating the bi-level model into Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation as well as a feasibility repairing mechanism is applied. In the end, the model and the solution methodology are illustrated with a real-life hazardous medical waste management problem and practical insights are derived. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

"Under the background of economic globalization, supply chain is becoming more and more complex, which is manifested in the instability of external environment. On the one hand, with the improvement of global environmental protection awareness, the government's policy tools for environmental impact (carbon tax) on the whole supply chain have become one of the major external problems faced by the supply chain enterprises; on the other hand, the intensification of competition between upstream and downstream in supply chains makes supply disruption an important proposition to be solved urgently. In this paper, the two propositions of green and supply disruption are reduced to two factors affecting the cost. The average total cost function of the manufacturer as a recycler is established. The practicability of the algorithm and the effectiveness of the model are verified by Lingo, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Genetic Algorithm, with the purpose of obtaining the optimal strategies for manufacturers who play the role of the recycler in the closed-loop supply chain.",Optimal Strategies for CLSC considering Supply Disruption and Carbon Tax, ,mathematical problems in engineering,WOS:000533315500001,2020,,,,,,
"Telecoupled systems connect consumption and other choices in one part of the world with land-use and landcover change in another. While such connections are increasingly well documented, research on governing telecoupled systems is in its infancy. Drawing on recent discussions in sociology, we argue that models for governing telecoupled systems must consider two types of information flows. Low-bandwidth flows allow for limited information transfer but can take place over greater distances. High-bandwidth flows, by contrast, allow for more complex knowledge transfer but tend to be geographically localized due to the costs of maintaining robust connections. Using a mixed-methods case study of national sustainability certification in the wine sector in Australia and Chile, we argue that Chile's counterintuitive success in diffusing its national sustainability certification relates to its geography, which facilitated high-bandwidth connections. We conclude that telecoupling governance measures, such as jurisdictional commodity certification, need to consider the unique requirements and costs of high-bandwidth connections in allocating institutional investments.",The bandwidth problem in telecoupled systems governance: Certifying sustainable winemaking in Australia and Chile,Telecoupling *** Sustainability *** Wine *** Diffusion *** Environmental certification,ecological economics,WOS:000521120500005,2020,,,,,,

"The purpose of this study is to examine relationships between measures of sustainable freight transport performance (in the context of mid-sized third-party auto components' logistics players) with the associated externalities and firms' intrinsic characteristics when information exchange occurs between logistics firms and the auto manufacturer. Employing a survey-based research methodology, appropriate data were collected for a number of third-party logistics players, thus yielding a total of 708 responses from the operational managers of these firms. The research construct was validated through a rigorous procedure involving measurement and structural equation model. From a theoretical perspective, the results of this study provide evidences supporting systemic relationships between internal enablers of the logistics firms and externalities in the backdrop of environmental sustainability. Major findings indicate that transportation planning and distribution network and, commodity considerations backed by top management support can further environmental performance. Further, we also find evidence that effective transport planning and distribution network design used in conjunction with commodity considerations can be a source of sustainable supply chain performance. By bridging the literature pertaining to environmental sustainability, information exchange, and pertinent external/internal nuances of logistics firms, this study reveals novel findings that can help logistics players streamline operations focused at achieving environmental sustainability performance.",Examining freight performance of third-party logistics providers within the automotive industry in India: an environmental sustainability perspective,Sustainability *** logistics industry *** environment *** freight transportation *** empirical study,international journal of production research,WOS:000532429200001,2020,,,,,,
"Due to the relatively long period and large capital flow of public-private partnership (PPP) projects, PPP participants are faced with a complex risk situation impeding the sustainable project delivery. In recent years, risk management of PPP projects has received increasing attention. In this paper, twenty risk factors associated with infrastructure PPP projects were identified by literature review and in-depth case studies. Relationship data for these twenty typical risk factors were obtained through structured interviews. Based on the obtained data, the risk relationship network within infrastructure PPP projects was identified, and the network structure characteristics were analyzed, including individual node attributes and the influence and cohesion of subgroups. The results indicate that key risk factor nodes can form a reaction chain via bridge nodes that can trigger a risk domino effect within PPP projects. Specifically, the key risk factors of PPP projects are divided into two categories, the first of which include risk factors that have powerful and independent influence, such as delay in government approval, government credit, and imperfect legal and regulatory systems. The second category includes risk factors that are highly vulnerable and easily influenced, such as completion risks, insufficient revenue in the market, and fee change. A key risk factor reaction chain is one in which legal change leads to a decline in government credit rating, triggering a contract risk. Twelve bridge nodes were identified that play an important intermediary role in the network, e.g., legal change, public objection, and financing risk. This paper extends the application of social network analysis in PPP projects management research and identifies the key risk factors and crucial factors influencing chain reactions in PPP projects. The results provide a more in-depth understanding of sustainable PPP project management for government agencies and private enterprises.",Exploring the Risk Factors of Infrastructure PPP Projects for Sustainable Delivery: A Social Network Perspective,infrastructure PPP project *** risk factors *** relationship analysis *** social network analysis *** sustainable project delivery,sustainability,WOS:000543421400210,2020,,,,,,
"Smallholder farmers will continue to play a critical role in meeting the growing demand for food and non-food farm products in the next 30 years. Challenges in meeting this demand include climate change; deficiencies in enabling environments, resources, and capacities; and inappropriate institutional models of RD&E and development. Smallholders must improve productivity, volume, quality, and consistency of supply, but their downstream customers must also be competitive. Most smallholder supply chains lack the capacity for this. Therefore, new, vibrant agricultural innovation systems, or AIS, and improved enabling environments are vital. This paper outlines a transdisciplinary framework for investigating and facilitating these changes. It is based on the literature, projects, and experiences working in a range of developed and developing countries. A dualistic agribusiness systems model can help identify the complexity of problems, and the constraints to improving the productivity of smallholders and their value chains. It combines participatory and pluralistic action research and action learning processes to provide relevant solutions to improving the competitiveness of these chains.

"There has been an increasing emphasis on environment management due to generation of toxic waste, scarcity of natural resources, etc. This has pushed manufacturing organizations to implement closed loop supply chain practices. In this paper, critical factors for the implementation of closed loop supply chain practices are identified and analyzed in the Indian automotive sector. Various key factors were identified from extant literature and subsequently validated from 28 industry experts. Further, cause and effect relationships among the factors are examined by applying Grey-Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory technique.

"The rising electronics waste (e-waste), increased pollution, disposal issues and exploitation of natural resources have augmented ecological and resource scarcity problems. These problems can be abate by adopting reverse logistics (RL) implementation so, the environmental protection and resource recovery options such as reuse, refurbish, recycle, remanufacturing and proper disposal can be executed to deal and manage with the e-waste. The goal of this research work is to identifies, evaluate and analyze the factors for successful implementation of RL practices. Fifteen critical RL factors are recognized from pertinent literature and endorsed by industry professionals. This paper utilized Grey based Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) approach to sort the identified factors into cause and effect clusters. Grey DEMATEL resolves the problem of data uncertainty and impreciseness involves in decision making in analyzing the factors. The results of the study found that 11 RL factors came into causal cluster as vital factors and 4 RL factors into the effect cluster as fundamental problems factors. Among causal cluster, the highest ranked four influential factors are Top management commitment (RLF1) with weightage value 0.7604, RLF2 i.e. enforced government regulations with weightage value 0.6549, RLF6 i.e. environmental/green concerns factor with weightage value 0.5678 and RLF8 i.e. Waste minimization (especially e-waste) factor with weightage value 0.5113 are respectively. Similarly, among effect cluster, the most easily influenced two factors are Market and competition factors (RLF15) with weightage value (- 1.1207) and Increased e-commerce (RLF13) with weightage value (- 1.2855) respectively. A case example of an Indian electronics firm is taken to showcase the application of the proposed model. This paper can help supply chain managers and analysts in superior understanding of critical factors and increase the chances of practicing more effective and successful RL implementation in electronics industry.

"Nowadays, by increasing the sensitivity of governments to the issue of the environment, green supply chain design has become very significant. This paper presents a mathematical model based on a dual-channel system for designing a green supply chain. The first sales channel is based on the traditional retail purchasing system, while in the second channel the customers purchase the products from the plants directly. In the proposed model, decisions on location, products transfer and pricing are determined. Furthermore, the decision on the kind of manufacturing technology in each plant to be established is considered as well. Any kind of technology leads to a specific level of the greenness of the products in each plant. A product with a higher green level has a lower greenhouse gas emission but higher costs. In order to encourage managers to produce green products, government subsidy policies are in place. Besides, because of the uncertain nature of some parameters, a robust possibilistic optimization approach has been used. As the proposed mixed integer nonlinear model is complicated to solve, an Invasive Weed Optimization Algorithm (IWO) is proposed to obtain efficient solutions. Due to the nonlinear type of the developed model and due to there is no benchmark available in the related literature to validate the results, Cultural Algorithm (CA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) are utilized. The results indicate that IWO performs better than others. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

"Electronic reverse logistics topic has received growing attention because of its environmental and economic impact. In Canada, the province of Ontario has enacted regulations regarding the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Recycling program. The objective of this study is to develop a novel scenario-based robust possibilistic approach to optimize and configure an electronic reverse logistics network by considering the uncertainty associated with fixed and variable costs, the quantity of demand and return, and the quality of returned products. A Monte Carlo simulation is utilized to analyze the performance of our proposed model. Then, ANOVA test is conducted to statistically verify our model using the simulation results. The mathematical model is extended to the multi-objective optimization by maximising the environmental compliance of the third parties. The efficient solutions of the multi-objective model are computed using the two-phase fuzzy compromise approach. To provide a comprehensive assessment of the problem under investigation, we provide sensitivity analyses on the impact of different factors (e.g., recovery rates, capacity of facilities) on the total expected profit. Several interesting results were obtained, including the fact that increasing the capacity of facilities does not automatically translate into higher profits. Furthermore, by comparing the efficient solutions of deterministic and robust modes, we illustrate the impact of robustness price on the multi-objective model.

"The growing demand for fuels combined with the fact that there are limited fossil fuel resources has led the world to seek renewable energy resources such as biofuels. Micro-algae can be an efficient source of biofuel energy, since it significantly reduces air pollution. In this paper, we develop a micro-algae biofuel supply chain through a two-stage approach. This study aims to commercialize micro-algae as a new source of energy. In the first stage, we utilize the Best-Worst Method (BWM) to determine the best cultivation system, and in the second stage, a bi-objective mathematical model is presented which simultaneously optimizes the economic and environmental objectives. We also propose a robust optimization model to deal with the uncertain nature of the biofuel supply chain. Our analysis on the trade-off between the supply chain's total cost and unfulfillment demand arrives at interesting managerial insights. Furthermore, to show the effectiveness of the robust optimization model, we compare the performance of the robust and deterministic models, and the results show that the robust model dominates over the deterministic model in all scenarios. Finally, sensitivity analysis on critical parameters is conducted to help decision-makers find the optimal trade-off between investment and its benefits.",A robust optimization model for a biofuel supply chain under demand uncertainty,Mathematical modeling *** Robust optimization *** Supply chain *** Biomass *** Renewable energy,international journal of energy and environmental engineering,WOS:000529693500004,2020,,,,,,

"© Operational Research Society 2020. Crisis management is one of the significant challenges when a disaster occurs. Post disaster operations mainly focus on medical treatments. One of the general requirements of medical treatments of field hospitals in disaster is blood transfusion. This way, configuring a blood transfusion network to handle the appropriate assignments and distribution is proved to influence the type, number and severity of recent crises. Therefore, obtaining effective solutions, containing determining the optimal location of facilities of field hospitals, identifying the optimal capacity of facilities and transportation, blood transfusion routes to reduce costs and injustices in this area in times of crisis is essential. Hence, in this study, we proposed a model, intend for allocating blood types and regarding the lifetime of blood to tackle with field hospitals in the disaster sites. Furthermore, the coverage of the demand for blood types for the establishment of field hospitals and the balanced distribution of blood between these hospitals from the blood collection level to the establishment of field hospitals with optimal routing of blood transfusion at the lowest cost is considered. The proposed model for the crisis response management phase is modelled applying a multi-objective mathematical model under uncertain conditions. To cope with the uncertain data arisen in the disaster condition, the robust optimization approach is applied. Then, to solve the proposed model, a hybrid method based on Genetic Algorithm and Multi-Choice Goal Programming (GAMCGP) under uncertainty is developed. In addition, the proposed model is successfully applied to a real- world blood supply chain in Mazandaran, northern part of Iran, and the results validate the performance of the proposed model. It also proves that the suggested model can be considered as a new approach for blood supply chain tactical management in the crisis logistics.",A robust optimization model of the field hospitals in the sustainable blood supply chain in crisis logistics,blood supply chain *** Genetic Algorithm Multi-Choice Goal Programming (GAMCGP) *** lifetime of blood *** location and routing *** Robust optimization,journal of the operational research society,85094887263,2020,,,,,,
"Augmented globalization and vertical integration have made contemporary supply chains an intricate network subject to a number of vulnerabilities. Preemptive measures are needed for dealing with mutable risks and vulnerabilities to safeguard robust supply chain systems. Supply chain risk management (SCRM) connotes a set of risk management responses essentially instigated to confront supply chain risks. As supply chain risks are intertwined, one resilient strategy for risk mitigation can moderate several supply chain risks. A complex decision making problem involving twelve major supply chain risks and twenty one resilient strategies for risk mitigation have been acknowledged in this research with archetypal focus on electronics manufacturing supply chains. A combination of Multi criteria decision aid (MCDA) and artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in decision making of complex real world problems. A decision support model incorporating an amalgamation of grey theory and layered analytic network process (ANP) has been employed for quantifying various resilient strategies for risk mitigation. The proposed model was also applied in a practical setting taking a case study of an electronics manufacturing company. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted to ensure the robustness of obtained results. The combined methodology proposed in this research could be effectively used by top management, to pigeonhole the resilient supply chain strategies for better managing their supply chains.",A grey-layered ANP based decision support model for analyzing strategies of resilience in electronic supply chains,Supply chain resilience *** Supply chain risk *** Resilient strategies *** Grey theory *** Analytic network process,engineering applications of artificial intelligence,WOS:000506715100046,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: This paper aims to evaluate the collaboration quality performance of sugar company Z and its stakeholders (farmers and distributors) by considering the sustainability aspects. This assessment shall be able to integrate qualitative and quantitative factors in the model, which is critical in sugar supply chains involving multi-stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach: Integration of quality function deployment (QFD), the fuzzy analytical network process (FANP) and the data envelopment analysis (DEA) is administered to assess the efficiency score of each stakeholder involved. The evaluation encompasses collaboration behaviour factors since the input of collaboration activities will result in sustainability aspects such as revenue, green house gas (GHG) emissions and social impact. The analysis has been conducted in two scenarios, those are the basic scenario by utilising original data and the extended scenario by using projection data. Findings: The result clarifies that the most influential behaviour factor in the collaboration activities is commitment (0.116), while the least important behaviour factors are power (0.008) and adaptation (0.008). Furthermore, by using the extended scenario, the overall efficiency for each benchmarking is higher compared to the condition before the improvement (basic scenario). Research limitations/implications: The result of this study is only relevant to the particular sugar supply chain and involving limited sustainability variables. Therefore, in a further study, more variables such as technical and financial aspects could be explored further in the assessment process. Practical implications: The result of this study is available for each stakeholder and can be fundamental for the constant improvement in sustainable supply chain (SSC) practices. It shows that an improvement of one stakeholder will positively impact the entire system. Social implications: Smallholders and sugarcane farmers will recognise the significance of collaboration behaviour. Thus, they can enhance their mutual benefits by using the existing resources. Originality/value: This paper arranges for a practical contribution by implementing advanced assessment methods in the sugar supply chain by taking into account the economic, environmental and social aspects.

"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd The context of the sustainable supply chain (SSC) is progressively getting attention among supply chain (SC) managers due to its competitive advantage in firms' performance. Increasing supply chain complexity (SCC) is argued as one of the biggest risks in achieving the organisational goal with an adverse impact on operational efficiency, cost, profitability, on-time delivery, and customer satisfaction. Though drivers of SSC and SCC have seemingly demonstrated mutual relationship in a practical scenario, supply chain managers tend to address respective drivers independently for managing and controlling. Limited availability of literature investigating interactions among drivers of SSC and SCC with its overall impact on the supply chain motivates deeper research. To address the gap, current research aims to study the mutual relationship between SSC and SCC drivers. To achieve this, a combination of sequential exploratory two-phased research methodology is adopted. The Delphi technique is initially applied to identify the critical SSC and SCC drivers followed by using interpretive structural modeling (ISM) to decipher the mutual relationship among the SSC and SCC drivers. The interactions between SSC and SCC drivers explored in this work will provide supply chain managers a framework for informed decision making. The driving and dependence power of drivers can guide SC practitioners to prioritize and focus on key drivers with a high impact on the overall outcome. The organization can also be benefitted by managing SSC and SCC drivers in synergy against the silo approach. The research finding suggests that market uncertainty, institutional regulations, strategic supplier collaboration, customer pressure, and new technologies are key five drivers in decision-making.","Analysis of supply chain sustainability with supply chain complexity, inter-relationship study using delphi and interpretive structural modeling for Indian mining and earthmoving machinery industry", ,resources policy,85086479532,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020 The Authors. Reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agriculture is critical to limiting future global warming. In response, a growing number of food retailers and manufacturers have committed to reducing N2O emissions from their vast networks of farmer suppliers by providing technical assistance and financial incentives. A key challenge for such companies is demonstrating that their efforts are leading to meaningful progress toward their climate mitigation commitments. We show that a simplified version of soil surface nitrogen (N) balance—or partial N balance—the difference between N inputs to and outputs from a farm field (fertilizer N minus crop N), is a robust indicator of direct N2O emissions from fields with maize and other major rainfed temperate-region crops. Furthermore, we present a generalized environmental model that will allow food-supply-chain companies to translate aggregated and anonymized changes in average N balance across their supplying farms into aggregated changes in N2O emissions. This research is an important first step, based on currently available science, in helping companies demonstrate the impact of their sustainability efforts.",Quantifying On-Farm Nitrous Oxide Emission Reductions in Food Supply Chains,agriculture *** cropland *** metrics and indicators *** nitrogen balance *** nitrous oxide *** sustainability,earth's future,85093875282,2020,,,,,,
"© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature. Reverse logistics (RL) is gradually becoming more important to manufacturing companies through environmental awareness, competitiveness, and environmental regulations. In the leather footwear industry of Bangladesh, it is possible to recycle and reuse waste, meaning a reverse logistics system could increase return-on-investment and give a competitive advantage. To date, studies on barriers to RL implementation have been conducted in other countries and in other domains, leaving a research gap in RL barrier analyses in the leather footwear industry. There are many obstacles to implementing RL in a developing country like Bangladesh; examining these barriers is a crucial research issue. This paper identifies RL barriers through (1) an extent literature review, (2) advice from Bangladeshi industry experts under the Delphi study, and (3) ranking RL barriers using the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process. The results indicate that, of the barriers investigated, the ‘knowledge and support’ category seems to be most critical. A lack of interest and support from top-level management—related to ‘knowledge and support’ issues—appears to be the major obstacle for RL implementation in the Bangladeshi leather footwear industry. These findings will help the Bangladeshi leather footwear industry, as well as other industries in Bangladesh, to understand the nature of each barrier and overcome the complexity of RL implementation in supply chains. This study will also assist decision-makers in making certain strategic policies. Future studies may contribute to the life cycle assessment and engineering of recycled and reused footwear.",Examining barriers to reverse logistics practices in the leather footwear industry,Delphi study *** Footwear industry *** Fuzzy AHP *** Green logistics *** Reverse logistics,annals of operations research,85075187279,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: Mismanagement of supply chain operations may lead to waste of products and incur substantial monetary losses. This is particularly true for products with attributes that hasten deterioration, e.g. time, temperature, humidity and barometric pressure. Attribute-sensitive products must be carefully monitored throughout all supply chain processes to ensure acceptable quality to the end customers. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the scientific literature on attribute sensitive products and on attribute sensitive supply chains. The collected studies were reviewed using the content analysis method, focusing on the following aspects of attribute sensitive products: (1) industries; (2) product categories; (3) decisions involved; (4) processes; (5) current issues; (6) sustainability concerns; (7) research methods used; (8) objectives of decision makers; (9) solution approaches used; (10) incentives driving management and (11) future research issues. Based on the analysis of findings, gaps are identified, and future research directions are proposed. Design/methodology/approach: Literature review and content analysis. Findings: The authors discovered that, while the importance of product attributes vary from one industry to the other, overall the time attribute was critical in all of the industries considered in this literature review. Coordination, customer satisfaction, reliability and safety were key issues in attribute sensitive product supply chains (asp-SCs). Similar to the typical supply chains, asp-SCs face economic, social and environmental sustainability issues. However, the majority of the studies in our analysis emphasized importance of the social sustainability. The majority of the papers were reviewed and analyzed and adopted the modeling approach as a research method. Furthermore, it was found that asp-SCs were mostly driven with customer demands and social pressure. Research limitations/implications: Based on the literature review and content analysis, there are a number of directions for the work conducted in this study to be extended in several directions. First, the literature search could be expanded by relaxing some of the restrictions (e.g. include the conference papers and articles from on-line business journals). Second, additional scientific publishers can be considered (e.g. Emerald Insight–www.emeraldinsight.com; Inderscience–www.inderscience.com). The latter two extensions would allow a more precise assessment of published to date work on asp-SC operations. Third, our findings could be validated based on interviews with professionals and executives from companies dealing with asp-SCs. Such validation will allow identification of the differences between the state of the art and the state of practice. Practical implications: Supply chains that handle attribute sensitive products (asps) must consider the complexity of products that significantly change their properties due to factors such as time, temperature, barometric pressure, humidity. Mismanagement of operations within such supply chains may lead to significant product waste, as well as substantial monetary losses. Originality/value: This study presented a comprehensive literature review and content analysis of studies dealing with asps in the following industries: fashion, food, healthcare, humanitarian and pharmaceutical industries",Management of supply chains with attribute-sensitive products: a comprehensive literature review and future research agenda,Attribute-sensitive products *** Cold chains *** Content analysis *** Product decay,international journal of logistics management,85091278590,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: Research has extensively focused on the cultural differences in supply chain collaboration while neglecting the importance of cultural similarities and compatible goals among supply chain members. With the rise of global supply chain network, the choice of supply chain orientation is critical. This study argues that performance differences between these configurations highlight managerial implications for sustainable development. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing from uncertainty reduction and cognitive social capital theories, this study developed a taxonomy of manufacturing firms based on process alignment between cultural compatibility and supply chain communication. The empirical data used in this study were drawn from the Global Manufacturing Research Group (GMRG) survey project, with data collected from 680 manufacturing companies, across various industry sectors and countries. Findings: There appeared to be consistent three major configurations: the Proactive, the Initiative and the Reactive. Manufacturers distanced themselves based mainly on communication with customers on events and proprietary information. Communication-cultural compatibility taxonomies influence differently on operations and financial performance. The Initiative, who excelled in communication practices gained significant improvement in efficiency and delivery measures. While Reactive lagged, Proactive aligned in both capabilities to experience higher payoffs in operational and financial measures. The findings offer a step-by-step approach where manufacturers intensify communication with partners for better efficiency and delivery measures, then align cultural practices to obtain financial, quality and innovation performance. Research limitations/implications: It will be fruitful for future research to examine the evolution of longitudinally. A comparison between developed and developing economies will be of interest. Practical implications: The findings provide a step-by-step decision-making process for supply chain communication and offer guidance especially for global supply chain managers. Originality/value: This study adds greater comprehensiveness and richness to the information exchange literature on performance by process aligning to enhance cultural compatibility.",Supply chain communication and cultural compatibility: performance implications in the global manufacturing industry,Communication *** Cultural compatibility *** Cultural difference *** Organizational culture *** Process alignment,business process management journal,85090944140,2020,,,,,,

The proliferating need for sustainability intervention in food grain transportation planning is anchoring the attention of researchers in the interests of stakeholders and environment at large. Uncertainty associated with food grain supply further intensifies the problem steering the need for designing robust, cost-efficient and sustainable models. In line with this, this paper aims to develop a robust and sustainable intermodal transportation model to facilitate single type of food grain commodity shipments while considering procurement uncertainty, greenhouse gas emissions, and intentional hub disruption. The problem is designed as a mixed integer non-linear robust optimisation model on a hub and spoke network for evaluating near optimal shipment quantity, route selection and hub location decisions. The robust optimisation approach considers minimisation of total relative regret associated with total cost subject to several real-time constraints. A version of Particle Swarm Optimisation with Differential Evolution is proposed to tackle the resulting NP-hard problem. The model is tested with two other state-of the art meta-heuristics for small, medium, and large datasets subject to different procurement scenarios inspired from real time food grain operations in Indian context. Finally, the solution is evaluated with respect to total cost, model and solution robustness for all instances.",Robust optimisation of sustainable food grain transportation with uncertain supply and intentional disruptions,metaheuristics *** particle swarm optimisation *** robust optimisation *** sustainable supply chain *** transportation,international journal of production research,85073782482,2020,,,,,,

"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd Hydrogen is currently considered one of the most promising sustainable energy carriers for mobility applications. A model of the hydrogen supply chain (HSC) based on MILP formulation (mixed integer linear programming) in a multi-objective, multi-period formulation, implemented via the ε-constraint method to generate the Pareto front, was conducted in a previous work and applied to the Occitania region of France. Three objective functions have been considered, i.e., the levelized hydrogen cost, the global warming potential, and a safety risk index. However, the size of the problem mainly induced by the number of binary variables often leads to difficulties in problem solution. The first innovative part of this work explores the potential of genetic algorithms (GAs) via a variant of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to manage multi-objective formulation to produce compromise solutions automatically. The values of the objective functions obtained by the GAs in the mono-objective formulation exhibit the same order of magnitude as those obtained with MILP, and the multi-objective GA yields a Pareto front of better quality with well-distributed compromise solutions. The differences observed between the GA and the MILP approaches can be explained by way of managing the constraints and their different logics. The second innovative contribution is the modelling of demand uncertainty using fuzzy concepts for HSC design. The solutions are compared with the original crisp models based on either MILP or GA, giving more robustness to the proposed approach.",Optimization of a hydrogen supply chain network design under demand uncertainty by multi-objective genetic algorithms,Fuzzy techniques *** Genetic algorithm *** Hydrogen supply chain *** Multiobjective optimization *** TOPSIS,computers and chemical engineering,85086395218,2020,,,,,,
"© 2018 Elsevier Inc. From a resource-based view, this paper investigates sustainability integration across multiple tiers in two Italian luxury supply chains producing fashion and leather footwear, a complex and fragmented industry sector that is highly dependent upon raw materials and a human skills base. Qualitative in-depth interview data were collected from senior industry informants within 10 businesses, spanning multiple supply chain tiers. Industry practices are systematically decomposed into product, process and supply chain levels to analyse supply chain sustainability. Findings reveal that product-level practices focused on raw materials more than design initiatives, with operational benefits of cost reduction and market benefits of consumer value-add. Process-level practices in water and energy reduction were motivated by cost reduction benefits more than environmental concerns. At supply chain level, traceability projects and supplier audits were limited by a lack of end-to-end supply chain visibility, despite the criticality of raw materials and evidence of close and long-term trading relationships. Supply chain transparency and supplier engagement are critical areas for development. Both technical and relational resources must be developed across supply networks.

"© 2020 by the authors. Closed-loop supply chain networks are gaining research popularity due to environmental, economic and social concerns. Such networks are primarily designed to overcome carbon footprints and to retrieve end of life products from customers. This study considers a multi echelon closed-loop supply chain in the presence of machine disruption. A multi-objective model is presented to optimize the total cost, the total time and emissions in a closed-loop supply chain network. The aim is to analyze the trade-off between the objectives of cost, time, and emissions and how these decisions are impacted by the selection of different available machines. A number of solution approaches are tested on a case study from the tire industry. The results suggest the improved performance of the hybrid heuristic and the importance of controlling disruption in a closed-loop supply chain network. Furthermore, there is a trade-off between the different objective functions which can help the decision maker to choose a particular solution according to the preference of an organization. Finally, conclusion and future research avenues are provided.",A trade-off analysis of economic and environmental aspects of a disruption based closed-loop supply chain network,Closed-loop supply chain *** Economic sustainability *** Energy efficiency *** Environmental sustainability,sustainability (switzerland),85090417448,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd Today, due to the increasing environmental hazards and governmental regulations, as well as the limitation of sources of production, researchers have paid special attention to the design of closed-loop green supply chain networks. The closed-loop supply chain networks (CLSCN) include the returns processes and the producers aim to capturing additional value considering further integration of all supply chain activities. Therefore, all return processes need to be optimized as well as considering environmental impacts leading to form a closed-loop green supply chain network (CLGSCN). For decision making purposes, operational and tactical decision making levels are integrated to configure a coordinated supply chain network aiming to maximize profit while keeping environmental-friendly policies. The case is more sophisticated in melting industries where the collection and categorization in return process and different environmental challenges should be considered at the same time. Thus, in this paper, a CLGSCN of a melting industry is modeled with respect to environmental hazards to optimiza overall profits. Since real-world demand in melting industry under study is uncertain, the robust optimization has been employed, and while the optimization of the proposed mathematical model is time consuming, an improved version of the genetic algorithm has been implemented as a solution method. This study has been carried out at Melting Imen Tabarestan (MIT) company in Iran. The proposed model along with the solution method are investigated in the case study.

"© 2020 Elsevier B.V. The academic community and practitioners widely recognize the significance of risk management and integrative practices in supply chains to deal with complexity and uncertainties faced. Firms strive to manage risk, handle unexpected disruptions and improve performance in ever changing uncertain business environments. This paper builds upon the information processing view of risk management and explores the association between supply chain integration (SCI) and supply chain risk management (SCRM) to improve operational performance. Subsequently, the mediating role played by SCRM between SCI and firms’ operational performance is examined. In this paper, covariance-based structural equation modeling is applied to test the developed hypotheses using data of 931 manufacturing companies obtained from the sixth version of International Manufacturing Strategy Survey (IMSS VI). The findings of the study suggest that internal, supplier and customer integration positively effects SCRM whereas the impact of internal integration is also partially mediated by supplier and customer integration. Additionally, the results present that SCRM partially mediates the relationship between internal integration and operational performance and fully mediates the association between supplier and customer integration and operational performance. This paper contributes to research by proposing and empirically testing a holistic framework demonstrating the effects of SCI on SCRM, and consequently on performance outcomes to develop theoretical and managerial implications.",Supply chain risk management and operational performance: The enabling role of supply chain integration,Information processing *** Operational performance *** Supply chain integration *** Supply chain risk management,international journal of production economics,85079622104,2020,,,,,,

"© 2020 The Authors Closed-loop supply chain network design (CLSCND) has been increasingly spotlighted over the latest decade. The focus has been given to maximize the economic performance, resource utilization and sustainability through incorporating a holistic decision-making on both forward and reverse logistics. In this paper, a new fuzzy-stochastic multi-objective mathematical model is formulated for sustainable CLSCND. The model aims at balancing the trade-off between cost effectiveness and environmental performance under different types of uncertainty. The environmental performance of CLSCND is measured by carbon emission. Moreover, the network flexibility is modeled and incorporated in the decision-making so that customer demands can be fulfilled by different means. In order to solve the complex optimization problem, the model is first defuzzilized and converted into an equivalent crisp form. Then, a sample average approximation based weighting method (SAAWM) is developed to obtain a set of Pareto optimal solutions between cost and carbon emission under different uncertain environments. The model is validated through a set of numerical experiments. The computational results show, through the incorporation with network flexibility, the proposed mathematical model and solution approach can effectively generate consistent objective values and solutions over different scenario trees and obtain robust strategic decisions on facility locations. Meanwhile, the flexibility and rationality of the decision-making on transportation management, demand allocation and facility operations can be improved as well.",A fuzzy-stochastic multi-objective model for sustainable planning of a closed-loop supply chain considering mixed uncertainty and network flexibility,Closed-loop supply chain network design *** Facility location *** Fuzzy programming *** Multi-objective optimization *** Network flexibility *** Stochastic programming,journal of cleaner production,85084797415,2020,,,,,,

If such uncertainties and risks are not foreseen in the chain, and corresponding appropriate measures are not taken to handle them, irreparable damages would be expected consequently. The importance of this issue in closed-loop supply chains is more appreciated due to the importance and the effect of this chain on the environment. In this research, the disruption risk and the uncertainties related to the demand, market price, and the number of returned products are simultaneously considered. Purchasing from the backup suppliers and spot market are considered, to take the proper measures in case of uncertainties. Two-stage stochastic programming model is used to express the uncertainty. The decisions on the purchase from the uncertain suppliers, and reserving from backup suppliers are made in the first step. Then, after determining the uncertainties, return decisions (purchasing from the backup suppliers, spot market and the use of returned products) are made. Besides, we develop our model with CVaR risk measurement tool, and assess risk neutral and risk averse models. We also investigate how changes in the key problem parameters can affect sourcing strategies of a firm.",Supplier selection and order allocation in CLSC configuration with various supply strategies under disruption risk,Closed-loop supply chain *** Conditional value at risk *** Procurement management *** Sample average approximation *** Supplier selection *** Supply disruption,opsearch,85084755744,2020,,,,,,

Background To contribute toward the dialogue on addressing non-communicable and chronic disease in humanitarian emergencies, this article will explore the experiences of Médecins Sans Frontières in attempting to find support for the haemodialysis network in Yemen. With the changing profile of the global disease burden and a broadening concept of emergency health needs to include chronic illness and disability, the aid sector has committed through the World Humanitarian Summit and the Sustainable Development Goals to leave no one behind and thus to meet the health needs of these previously excluded and highly vulnerable people. The civil war in Yemen compromised the medical supply chain supporting the health facilities providing dialysis for patients with end-stage renal disease. The article will critique the aid sector’s slow response to this issue and expose the gap between principles, commitments, and practice related to noncommunicable disease in emergencies. Method Following direct experiences from the authors as leaders in the aid response in Yemen, reviews of grey literature from aid and health actors in Yemen were conducted along with a review of literature and policy documents related to noncommunicable disease in emergency. Key informant interviews and press statements supported analysis and events that took place in the time span of roughly 4 years that frames this period of analysis. Results Examination of the impacted patient population, interviews, literature and documented events indicates that there is discord between policy, commitments stated by aid donors and practice. Conclusion The aid sector must use a more contextualised approach when designing programmes to manage the burden of non-communicable diseases in health contexts where crises occur, particularly for lifesaving forms of therapy. Aid agencies and the global health community must increase pressure on donors and implementing agencies to live up to their commitments to include these patient populations.",The politics of exclusion: Fighting for patients with kidney failure in Yemen’s war, ,journal of public health (united kingdom),85089712705,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd Rising population and vehicle use resulted in an exponential growth of used tires generation which could cause significant disposal and environmental challenges. Thus, implementation of appropriate recycling or disposal practices has emerged as the critical challenge for the industries aiming to improve their environmental sustainability while satisfy the customers’ needs and maintain the economic benefits. In this study, a multi-level closed-loop supply chain network is developed under deterministic and uncertain conditions to maximize the time delivery, and minimize total costs, and environmental impacts under the uncertainty of some parameters. A three-objective mixed integer linear programming model is proposed. The delivery time of purchased materials from suppliers to the manufacturing plants is maximized using the first objective function. The network overall profitability is maximized using the second objective function, and the negative environmental impacts are minimized using the third objective function. Furthermore, to overcome the innate uncertainty of the models’ parameters, the Soyster and Mulvey approaches are applied. The developed model is implemented in a case study of a Tire Company. The results revealed the efficiency of on-time delivery considerations on the selection of internal and external suppliers. Applying the VIKOR method demonstrated the better performance of Soyster method compare to the Mulvey method. The results highlighted the performance of the proposed model in which the decision makers were enabled to decide among different types of suppliers (internal and external) based on the time delivery, total cost, and environmental impact.","Robust design of a multi-objective closed-loop supply chain by integrating on-time delivery, cost, and environmental aspects, case study of a Tire Factory",Close-loop supply chain network *** Environmental impacts *** Multi-objective optimization *** On-time delivery *** Robust optimization *** Tire production,journal of cleaner production,85084184260,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020 Kharazmi University. All rights reserved. The interaction of sustainability and resilience has not been sufficiently addressed in the supply chain literature. Applying sustainability and resilience concepts in a supply chain means the simultaneous optimization of the cost and recourses, including human and environmental ones, in facing possible risks. This paper tries to fill this gap by considering them simultaneously in a closed-loop supply chain. For this, a new mixed-integer programming (MIP) model was formulated for a closed-loop supply chain. In this research, different dimensions of sustainable development have been taken into account through reducing the total cost, energy consumption, and pollution and increasing job opportunities, and multiple-sourcing strategy has been applied for the resiliency of the supply chain. To validate the proposed model, the real data of a tire industry was used and the model was solved using the ε-Constraint method. The results emphasized the necessity of combining sustainability and resilience in a closed-loop supply chain, where the high amounts of demand, in addition to increasing the cost, energy consumption, and pollution, increase job opportunities and the need to backup suppliers for raw materials.",Multiple-sourcing in sustainable closed-loop supply chain network design: Tire industry case study,Multiple-sourcing *** Resilience *** Sustainability *** Tire closed-loop supply chain *** ε-Constraint,international journal of supply and operations management,85099520243,2020,,,,,,
"© ExcelingTech Pub, UK. In a review of the supply chain management of an urban area was examined in an imperative to demonstrate the benefits of a supply chain management method for an urban designing. Supply chains provide the critical infrastructure for the production and distribution of goods and services in our network economy and serve as the conduits for the manufacturing, transportation, and consumption of products ranging from food, clothing, automobiles, and high-technology products, to healthcare products. Cities as major population centers serve not only as the principal demand points but also as the locations of many of the distribution and storage facilities, transportation providers, and even manufacturers. In this paper a new model is developed for the design of sustainable supply chains with a focus on cities that captures the frequency of network link operations, which is especially relevant to cities due to frequent freight deliveries. Descriptive interviews were reviewed thoroughly with the conceptualization of the substantiated philosophy as a sociological technique of examination.

As the concept of sustainable development and environmental awareness has aroused huge attention from the public, environmental and social factors have gradually been critical to the development of upstream and downstream enterprises in the supply chain. An uncertain sustainable supply chain involving the factors of cost, environmental impact and social benefits is considered. Some factors (e.g., demand, cost and capacity) are recognized as uncertain variables. In the present study, a multi-objective chance-constrained model in the uncertain scenario is developed to delve into the impact of uncertainties on decision variables. In accordance with the uncertainty theory, this study elucidates the deterministic equivalence of the model. To solve this model effectively, a hybrid genetic algorithm is proposed based on variable length chromosome coding.

"© 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company. To mitigate the acute water shortage problems, water utilities are combating to find potential solutions. Water losses management in Water Supply Networks (WSNs) is amongst the prominent solutions. This work intends to develop a decision support framework to diagnose the criticality of WSNs according to an associated Water Loss Risk Index (WLRI) at pipe and zone levels. It utilized the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) to evaluate the influential factors that contribute to water losses. The Fuzzy Synthetic Evaluation Technique (FSET) has been utilized to assess WLRI at pipe level and Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operator has been used to aggregate the individual WLRI values for each zone. The framework is extended by incorporating Monte Carlo simulation model to generate the final ranking of zones. The outcomes of this simulation showed fair stability in terms of ranking the scrutinized zones. The integration of this framework in water losses management practices and planning policies of water utilities has a large potential in improving water supply services and the performance of WSNs.",An Integrated Decision-Making Framework to Appraise Water Losses in Municipal Water Systems,Decision support *** fuzzy set *** Monte Carlo simulation *** sensitivity analysis *** sustainability,international journal of information technology and decision making,85092606113,2020,,,,,,

"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd Circular economy (CE), as a way to address sustainable development, emphasizes on maximum utilization of input resources in a regenerative system that gives rise to the reduction in emissions, energy consumption, and waste. The first aim of this paper is to move towards CE through redesigning a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network for durable products, which are one of the most widely used category of goods. For this purpose, various recovery facilities are taken into account in CLSC structure; and cost, CO2 emissions, and energy consumption are taken into consideration as multiple objectives. The relevant mixed integer linear programming model is developed to make supplier selection, location-allocation, transportation mode, assembly technology, and recovery level decisions. Given that the strategic and tactical decisions in a CLSC are largely influenced by uncertainties, finding robust solutions is of great importance. The second aim of this study, thus, is to introduce and formulate novel robust optimization models by ways of possibilistic programming and scenario-based stochastic programming. These models are developed in linear terms to cope with different types of uncertainties including randomness and epistemic. Numerical examples are conducted based on some real energy and CO2 data. The results reveal the superiority of the circularity versus linearity in the supply chain. Pareto optimal solutions indicate the negative correlation of cost with energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The findings also show the reasonable performance of the robust models against uncertainty.",New robust optimization models for closed-loop supply chain of durable products: Towards a circular economy,Circular economy *** Closed-loop supply chain *** Durable products *** Possibilistic *** Robust optimization *** Stochastic,computers and industrial engineering,85086437914,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020 by the author. Interactions between technological solutions for managing waste and energy supply chains are multilateral and can vary significantly, depending on multiple criteria and different characteristics. This concept paper puts forward a conceptual framework for sustainable development based on the notion of ""intelligence"" for Waste-to-Energy (WtE) strategies. The pillars of intelligence are defined and the quadruple helix model for energy transitions based on waste management is established. The ""smart"" nodes of a WtE supply chain management are analytically presented and discussed. Nevertheless, the intelligent notion for a supply chain cannot stand on its own. Systematical support of a participatory process is needed via Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools and e-techniques to be promoted for collective facilitation and sustainable management. This process encompasses intelligent residents and professionals as producers of waste and smart managers to supervise the supply chain towards sustainable management of energy and waste resources. It is argued that the ICT participatory interface has a multiplying effect, especially when adopting the middle pathway approach in local and/or decentralized level towards smart energy production from waste. Innovative solutions to maximize waste efficiency through the collaborative power of ICT networks is critical to be deployed within local communities. These can be based on internet of things, big data, operational modeling, complex systems science, games and narratives, and social networks. The conceptual framework presented herein provides a basis for decision support towards sustainable development and interaction through a creative pathway of collaboration applicable to all the levels of potential synergies. Main conclusions and future challenges indicate that more research effort is required by the scientific community to leverage on the collaborative power of social networks and to efficiently apply ICT methods for adopting the ""socially-oriented"" middle pathway approach within communities' empowerment. Only on this basis may the tale of two challenges have a happy end, both for energy transition and waste management.",Closing the loop between energy production and waste management: A conceptual approach towards sustainable development,ICT *** Intelligent pillars *** Middle pathway approach *** Participatory management interface *** Quadruple WtE helix *** Synergies,sustainability (switzerland),85089373898,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020, Springer Nature B.V. Earthquakes can cause significant damage to liquefied gas terminals, a critical part of lifeline facilities of energy supply networks, failure of which may lead to loss of hazardous material, explosion, environmental contamination, loss of functionality and disruption of business. To date, seismic risk analysis of such facilities mainly focuses at component level, with the inherent dynamic interaction between the supporting structure and non-structural components not receiving the merited attention. In the present study, the seismic performance of an actual facility comprising of a piping system and a reinforced concrete (RC) supporting structure is analyzed through a finite element model in the nonlinear regime, both as coupled and decoupled case. Plastic strains are used as engineering demand parameters (EDP) to define leakage limit state for pipes. Since the RC pipe rack supporting structure is designed for low seismic loads, shear is recognized as the predominant failure mode. The same components are then analyzed in unison, considering coupling due to dynamic interaction. Fragility functions are estimated for both cases using multiple stripe analysis. A set of strong ground motions artificially generated using the specific barrier model, are employed for developing fragility curves. They are expressed with peak ground acceleration (PGA) as an intensity measure. Statistical estimation of the parameters of fragility functions are based on maximum likelihood method. It is inferred that in the decoupled case, pipes show higher vulnerability at lower PGA, at higher PGA pipe rack can fail suddenly resulting in total failure of the system. Moreover, in coupled case the fragility of the pipes and RC rack changes substantially because of the piping system boundary conditions. Thus, concluding that the risk estimation could be erroneous if dynamic interaction is neglected.",Seismic fragility analysis of LNG sub-plant accounting for component dynamic interaction,Dynamic interaction *** Fragility analysis *** Piping network *** Supporting RC structure *** Vulnerability analysis,bulletin of earthquake engineering,85087088474,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd There are large volumes of forest biomass available, distributed over extensive geographic areas in Australia. However, it is largely a low-value resource sensitive to high procurement costs. Transportation cost is typically the biggest factor in the cost of a forest biomass supply chain and is a critical factor in the planning of profitable bioenergy conversion facilities. This study presents an example of using geographical information systems (GIS) to 1) evaluate the feasibility of setting up new bioenergy facilities, 2) evaluate the location of existing bioenergy facilities, and 3) optimize the locations of facilities in Queensland, Australia. This study uses forest biomass availability estimated from 5-year harvest log volumes. The log volumes are refined to biomass energy (PJ) using a model that considers forest type, sustainable retention of residues on sites, residue proportions of total above-ground biomass and energy conversion factors. The strategic locations of bioenergy conversion facilities are defined using cluster and outlier analysis of biomass energy distribution and transportation distance using the local index of spatial autocorrelation (LISA) in a GIS environment. The tactical selection of bioenergy conversion facilities is then established based on the required number of facilities and capacity, together with the maximal distance for transporting the forest biomass. This study uses Queensland, Australia as the study area to demonstrate the effectiveness of modern GIS tools to achieve more scientific planning in bioenergy conversion facility networks and supply chain.","Feasibility of locating biomass-to-bioenergy conversion facilities using spatial information technologies: A case study on forest biomass in Queensland, Australia",Forest biomass *** Geographical information systems *** Local index of spatial autocorrelation *** Location-allocation *** Site selection,biomass and bioenergy,85087080470,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd Rapid urbanization has several adverse repercussions on the hydrological cycle due to great demands of land and water for housing, transport, health, agriculture, education etc. This paper investigates the impact of the urbanization on the groundwater regime in Sidi Bouzid, an old city located in Central Tunisia under a semi-arid climate where groundwater is the sole source for water needs of the city and the surrounding farming areas. The groundwater vulnerability has been evaluated using the DRASTIC model under a GIS environment. This well-known model is based on the combination of seven parameters, Depth to water, net Recharge, Aquifer media, Soil media, Topography, Impact of vadose zone, and hydraulic Conductivity, that are considered as directly controlling the vulnerability of groundwater to potential risks. However, the original model does not consider the effect of urban land uses (urban sprawl and density) on groundwater so a modified DRASTICU model, that includes Urban land use as an eighth parameter has been applied. The net recharge assessment was also modified to include the contribution of leakages from water supply network and sewage networks to the aquifer recharge. On the other hand, soil classes of the aquifer and the vadose zone that are not included in the original listing of the model have been discussed and rated. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out to evaluate the effect of each individual parameter on the vulnerability zoning and to validate the use of each one. The validation of the DRASTICU model was done through the comparison between groundwater vulnerability index and nitrate concentrations. The vulnerability map shows that all the groundwater underlying the city is exposed to pollution risks with vulnerability index varying between extreme in the centre of the city (38%), very high in eastern parts (33.6%) and high (28.4%) elsewhere.",Assessment of urban groundwater vulnerability in arid areas: Case of Sidi Bouzid aquifer (central Tunisia),DRASTICU *** GIS *** Groundwater *** Nitrate *** Sidi Bouzid *** Urbanization,journal of african earth sciences,85084146626,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020 Elsevier Inc. In today's dynamic business environment, agile supply chain (ASC) has become a key strategic move to cope with market instability, handle competitive pressures and strengthen operational and organizational performance. Meanwhile ASC is a good example of a strategy drawing heavily on digitization since as a demand chain management it was information-centric and technology-centric from its inception. Yet, despite this relationship, a lack of coherence and clarity around the input of technology for ASC has impeded to portray accurately the relative importance of digitization in ASC strategies. This study provides a comprehensive and integrative review of 90 articles on ASC. By so doing, we contribute to the discussion about digitization in the supply chain in several ways. First, the paper reports descriptively and analytically how technology was addressed within the ASC literature. Second, it maps a nomological network of ASC research. Third, it finds that technology appears as a necessary but not-sufficient enabling factor for ASC deployment.

Generally, the uncertainty exists in configuring the SCLSC network problem according to the changes in the business environment (like transportation costs and demand). As a result, a Fuzzy Robust Optimization (FRO) is applied to cope with uncertainty in this study. Then, the proposed model is solved using the goal programming approach.

"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd Nowadays, many organizations are trying to balance the social, environmental, and economic aspects of their supply chains to gain competitive advantages against their rivals and have a sustainable supply chain. Steel is one of the most critical raw materials practically used in every aspect of our life, directly or indirectly influencing the industry and economy of a country. The final products of the steel industry can be reused at the end of their lifecycle, making the principles of reverse logistics applicable in the supply chain and turning it to a closed-loop supply chain. In this research, a multi-objective linear mathematical model under uncertainty is developed to optimize a steel sustainable closed-loop supply chain. The existed uncertainty is modeled through a scenario-based method in the stochastic environment, and the proposed multi-objective model is developed following a fuzzy goal programming approach. A real case study is explored in one of the active steel supply chains in Iran to validate the model. The model optimizes total profit, energy, and water consumption, CO2 emission, job opportunity created, and lost working days through determining optimal production technology, whether retailers get changed to hybrid centers or not, and the flow of material and products. The final results show that a mere 1% decrease in the profit can alleviate the harmful environmental effects by 5%. Finally, several managerial implications derived from final results and sensitivity analysis are discussed to provide insights for industry leaders who desire to increase their profits with regard to environmental and social effects.",Scenario-based design of a steel sustainable closed-loop supply chain network considering production technology,Closed-loop supply chain *** Fuzzy goal programming *** Production technology *** Steel industry *** Stochastic programming *** Sustainability,journal of cleaner production,85089680969,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020 The Author(s) This paper discusses an optimization model for handling the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic based on food supply network through regional food hubs (RFHs) under uncertainty. To this end, uncertainty is assumed in the demand and production data. During the Pandemic COVID-19 period, uncertainty has increased and the food supply chain system has changed. Thus, a new configuration of the food supply network requires analysis. In this paper, the concept of RFH is introduced to connect producers in rural areas and customers in urban areas. This paper determines the location and capacity of RFHs, the food supply network, the sum of maximum food supplies, and minimum logistics cost. This is done via a Multi-Objective Many-to-Many Location-Routing Problem model. Furthermore, since the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain, robust optimization is employed to handle uncertainties. During the current pandemic, red zones are defined to indicate the severity of the pandemic in a region. In this paper, the numerical experiment is considered for three scenarios: when a region is in large-scale social distancing, partial social distancing, or normal conditions. This social distancing situation is based on the defined red zones. The optimal food supply network is obtained for the three scenarios and the best scenario among the three is identified.",Scenarios for handling the impact of COVID-19 based on food supply network through regional food hubs under uncertainty,Agricultural policy *** COVID-19 pandemic *** Food security *** Logistics *** Many-to-many location-routing problem *** Multi-objective *** Regional food hubs *** Robust optimization *** Sustainable business *** Systems engineering *** Systems theory,heliyon,85091738354,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020 In practice, it is of paramount importance that firms make joint decisions in production planning, pricing and retailer selection while considering emission regulation. This is because the joint decisions can ensure firms to obtain higher profits while contributing to sustainable environments. However, due to the problem complexity, no models facilitating such decision making are available. This study aims to develop a model to help firms make optimal joint decisions. To model the situations where a manufacturer is the leader and the retailers are followers, we adopt the Stackelberg game theory and develop a 0–1 mixed nonlinear bilevel program to maximize the profits of both the manufacturer and his retailers. We further develop a nested genetic algorithm to solve the game model. Numerical examples demonstrate (i) the applicability of the game model and the algorithm and (ii) the robustness of the algorithm. Managerial insights are obtained, suggesting that (i) manufacturers need to identify the capacity ranges (called capacity traps) where capacity increases result in reduced profits when making decisions to optimize profits; (ii) retailers should make suitable, e.g., pricing decisions so that the manufacturers can include them in the supply chains; (iii) both manufacturers and retailers may not need to consider the carbon emission buying (or selling) price when making decisions.","Joint production planning, pricing and retailer selection with emission control based on Stackelberg game and nested genetic algorithm",Emission control *** Joint decision making *** Nested genetic algorithm *** Nonlinear bilevel programming *** Stackelberg game,expert systems with applications,85088392654,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to systematically review, synthesize and critically evaluate the current research status on the role of collaborative interorganizational relationships (CIRs) in supply chain risks (SCRs) from a social capital perspective and provide an organizing lens for future scholarship in this area. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a systematic literature review approach to investigate 126 articles from 27 peer-reviewed journals between 1995 and 2020. Findings: This paper investigates supply chain CIRs using a social capital perspective to explain the role of structural, relational and cognitive capital that resides in these relationships in various SCRs (i.e. environmental, supply, manufacturing, demand, information, financial and transportation). The review reveals that the three social capital dimensions uniquely and both positively and negatively affect different SCRs. The findings further suggest that the perceived SCRs can influence the structural and relational capital. Practical implications: This study calls for practitioners to consider the cognitive alignment with their supply network partners, their relational investments, as well as the interorganizational processes and systems in managing and alleviating SCRs. Originality/value: This review offers a theoretical articulation of how various aspects of CIRs affect SCRs. Specifically, this study extends the existing understanding of the role of social capital in SCRs through offering a synthesis of dominant findings and discourses, and avenues for future research.",The role of collaborative interorganizational relationships in supply chain risks: a systematic review using a social capital perspective,Collaboration *** Interorganizational relationships *** Social capital *** Supply chain risk *** Systematic review,supply chain management,85097127814,2020,,,,,,

Accordingly, this paper aims to improve the reliability and social responsibility of a hydrogen supply chain along with its economic and environmental aspects. To ensure the network's responsiveness, a new objective function is extended that maximizes the reliability of products' delivery. Also, a novel reliability approach is developed to immune the network against disruptions. As a new sustainability indicator, social factors are considered in the design of the hydrogen supply chain. Finally, a mixed possibilistic flexible programming method is proposed to assure the outputs' reliability.

"© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. What is the state-of-the-art literature regarding the adoption of the complexity theory (CT) in engineering management (EM)? What implications can be derived for future research and practices concerning sustainability issues? In this conceptual article, we critically discuss the current status of complexity research in EM. In this regard, we use IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, because it is currently considered the leading journal in EM, and is as a reliable, heuristic proxy. From this journal, we analyze 38 representative publications on the topic published since 2000, and extrapolated through a rigorous keyword-based article search. In particular, we show that: (1) the adoption of CT has been associated with a wide range of key themes in EM, such as new product development, supply chain, and project management. (2) The adoption of CT has been witnessed in an increasing amount of publications, with a focus on conceptual modeling based on fuzzy logics, stochastic, or agent-based modeling prevailing. (3) Many key features of CT seem to be quite clearly observable in our dataset, with modeling and optimizing decision making, under uncertainty, as the dominant theme. However, only a limited number of studies appear to formally adhere to CT, to explain the different EM issues investigated. Thus, we derive various implications for EM research (concerning the research in and practice on sustainability issues).",Discussing the use of complexity theory in engineering management: Implications for sustainability,Complexity theory *** Conceptual *** Engineering management *** Management *** Sustainability,sustainability (switzerland),85098132810,2020,,,,,,

"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd The concept of supply chain resilience continues to attract both industry and research experts in the field of energy. These stakeholders continue to tackle disruptions to supply chain systems through the introduction of strategy options for resilience. A better understanding of broader dimensions of potential disruptions to supply chains caused by uncertainties has become eminent, especially as currently experienced during the global COVID-19 pandemic. The effects of the outbreak in disrupting supply chains in the energy sector will, in the next decade, continue to be a likely concern for industry and research stakeholders. Balancing the increasing need for energy security to meet the continuous growth in energy demand through shortage reduction and increased uptime using optimization is the core of this research. This review paper provides an insight into recent studies in the field of natural gas supply chain resilience as a major player in the energy mix, and the continued disruption and subsequent shutdowns of plant nodes, which results in emission loss to the environment.

"© 2020 Elsevier B.V. Building on transaction cost economics theory and social network theory, we investigate the impact of dimensions of buyer-supplier network (BSN) complexity (horizontal, vertical, and spatial) on firms' environmental performance, specifically, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Using secondary data from diverse sources on the supply networks of 319 firms, extending to the Tier-2 level, we present and test a robust empirical model that also accounts for potential endogeneity effects. To understand this key relationship between BSN complexity and environmental performance at a deeper level, we further test the moderating influence of BSN members' reach on this key relationship. We also test the moderating effects of a focal firm's control over its BSN on this key relationship. We find that both the vertical complexity dimension and the horizontal complexity dimension of BSNs had a U-shaped relationship with the participating firms' GHG emissions. In contrast, the spatial complexity dimension of BSNs had a positive impact on the participating firms' GHG emissions. With respect to the moderating effects, we found that firms' control over their BSN negatively influenced these relationships, whereas the reach of the BSN members positively influenced these relationships. Taken together, this set of mixed-pattern findings casts new light on the broad literature of multitier BSNs, environmental sustainability, and the effective management of supply chains. The managerial implications of our findings are also discussed.",Impact of buyer-supplier network complexity on firms’ greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions: An empirical investigation,Buyer-supplier network complexity *** Environmental performance *** Greenhouse gas emissions *** Network control *** Network reach,international journal of production economics,85088822893,2020,,,,,,

Using concepts related to natural gas industry and the relations among the components of gas and oil wells, refineries, storage tanks, dispatching, transmission and distribution network, a seven-level supply chain has been offered and presented schematically. The aim of this paper is to optimize the case study using a multi-objective and multi-period model to minimize the economic and environmental costs as well as the penalty per underutilized capacity and maximize the total revenue as well as the service level. A small-sized model is verified and solved using an improved augmented ε-constraint algorithm to generate Pareto optimal solutions and assessed trade-offs among objectives in order to help decision makers make an optimal decision.

"© 2020 Elsevier B.V. The supply chain (SC) ability to return quickly and effectively to its initial condition or even a more desirable state after a disruption is critically important, and is defined as SC resilience. Nevertheless, it has not been sufficiently quantified in the related literature. This study provides a new metric to quantify the SC resilience by using the stochastic programming. Our metric measures the expected value of the SC's cost increase due to a possible disruption event during its recovery period. Based on this measure, we propose a two-stage stochastic program for the supply chain network design under disruption events that optimizes location, allocation, inventory and order-size decisions. The stochastic program is formulated using quadratic conic optimization, and the sample average approximation (SAA) method is employed to handle the large number of disruption scenarios. A comprehensive computational study is carried out to highlight the applicability of the presented metric, the computational tractability of the stochastic program, and the performance of the SAA. Several key managerial and practical insights are gained based on the computational results. This new metric captures the time and cost of the SC's recovery after disruption events contrast to most of previous studies and main impacts of these two aspects on design decisions are highlighted. Further, it is shown computationally that the increase of SC's capacity is not a suitable strategy for designing resilient SCs in some business environments.",Stochastic optimization of disruption-driven supply chain network design with a new resilience metric,Conic mixed-integer program *** Resilience metrics *** Stochastic programming *** Supply chain network design,international journal of production economics,85085111493,2020,,,,,,

This paper aims to assess transportation disruption risks using a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN). First, the disruption risk factors and their sub-factors were identified from the relevant articles and experts' opinions. The BBN-based model is developed to calculate the marginal probabilities of the risk factors and their sub-factors to determine the most sensitive factors/sub-factors. The framework was demonstrated using an example case of the pharmaceutical industry in Bangladesh. The findings reveal the usefulness of BBN in examining transportation disruptions in supply chains. BBN captured the interdependencies between the disruption risk factors/sub-factors effectively.

"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd Increasingly prevalent extreme weather events have caused resilience to become an essential sustainable development component for resource and infrastructure networks. Existing resilience metrics require detailed knowledge of the system and potential disruptions, which is not available in the early design stage. The lack of quantitative tools to guide the early stages of design for resilience, forces engineers to rely on heuristics (use physical redundancy, localized capacity, etc.). This research asserts that the required quantitative guidelines can be developed using the architecting principles of biological ecosystems, which maintain a unique balance between pathway redundancy and efficiency, enabling them to be both productive under normal circumstances and survive disruptions. Ecologists quantify this network characteristic using the ecological fitness function. This paper presents the required reformulation required to enable the use of this metric in the design and analysis of resource and infrastructure networks with multiple distinct, but interdependent, interactions. The proposed framework is validated by comparing the resilience characteristics of two notional supply chain designs: one designed for minimum shipping cost and the other designed using the proposed bio-inspired framework. The results support using the proposed bio-inspired framework to guide designers in creating resilient and sustainable resource and infrastructure networks.",Mimicking nature for resilient resource and infrastructure network design,Bio-inspired design *** Critical infrastructure *** Ecological network analysis *** Resilience *** Supply chains *** Sustainability,reliability engineering and system safety,85089081089,2020,,,,,,

Short food supply chains (SFSCs) are increasingly garnering attention in food systems research, owing to their rising popularity among consumers, producers and policy-makers in the last few decades. Written with the aim to identify research gaps for the Horizon Europe research and innovation programme, this literature review provides a state of play of the definition and characterisation of SFSCs, and of their sustainability. Drawing on hypotheses about SFSC sustainability elaborated in an expert network in France, this review summarises a wide range of papers from various disciplines in the SFSC literature, written in English or French, while specifically highlighting the empirical results derived from European projects. Though the literature tends to generally agree on the social benefits of SFSCs, their economic and environmental impacts typically elicit more heterogeneous outcomes, while their health/nutrition and governance dimensions remain under-explored. Based on this review, recommendations for a future research and innovation programme are outlined, addressing the contribution of SFSCs to agrifood system transition and resilience in the current context of the Covid-19 crisis and of the Green New Deal objectives.",Sustainable food supply chains: Is shortening the answer? a literature review for a research and innovation agenda,Literature review *** Local food systems *** New indicators of wealth *** Short food supply chain *** Sustainability,sustainability (switzerland),85096957375,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020, Springer Nature B.V. With the emergence of internet-based devices, the traditional industrial control system (ICS) networks have evolved to co-exist with the conventional IT and internet enabled IoT networks, hence facing various security challenges. The IT industry around the world has widely adopted the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) as an industry standard to numerically evaluate the vulnerabilities in software systems. This mathematical score of vulnerabilities is combined with environmental knowledge to determine the vulnerable nodes and attack paths. IoT and ICS systems have unique dynamics and specific functionality as compared to traditional computer networks, and therefore, the legacy cyber security models would not fit these advanced networks. In this paper, we studied the CVSS v3.1 framework’s application to ICS embedded networks and an improved vulnerability framework, named CVSSIoT-ICS, is proposed. CVSSIoT-ICS and CVSS v3.1 are applied to a realistic supply chain hybrid network which consists of IT, IoT, and ICS nodes. This hybrid network is assigned with actual vulnerabilities listed in the national vulnerability database (NVD). The comparison results confirm the effectiveness of CVSSIoT-ICS framework as it is equally applicable to all nodes of a hybrid network and evaluates the vulnerabilities based on the distinct features of each node type.",Vulnerability Modelling for Hybrid Industrial Control System Networks,Industrial control system *** Internet of things (IoT) *** Security *** Supply chain *** Vulnerability modelling,journal of grid computing,85087556810,2020,,,,,,
"© The Author(s) 2020. Accurate demand forecasting is always critical to supply chain management. However, many uncertain factors in the market make this issue a huge challenge. Especially during the current COVID-19 outbreak, the shortage of certain types of medical consumables has become a global problem. The intermittent demand forecast of medical consumables with a short life cycle brings some new challenges, such as the demand occurring randomly in many time periods with zero demand. In this research, a seasonal adjustment method is introduced to deal with seasonal influences, and a dynamic neural network model with optimized model selection procedure and an appropriate model selection criterion are introduced as the main forecasting models. In addition, in order to reduce the impact of zero demand, it adds some input nodes to the neural network by preprocessing the original input data. Lastly, a modified error measurement method is proposed for performance evaluation. Experimental results show that the proposed forecasting framework is superior to other intermittent demand models.",Intermittent demand forecasting for medical consumables with short life cycle using a dynamic neural network during the COVID-19 epidemic,accuracy measurement *** dynamic neural network *** intermittent demand forecasting *** optimized model selection *** short life cycle,health informatics journal,85090548211,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020, The Author(s). Pandemics like COVID-19 have created a spreading and ever-higher healthy threat to the humans in the manufacturing system which incurs severe disruptions and complex issues to industrial networks. The intelligent manufacturing (IM) systems are promising to create a safe working environment by using the automated manufacturing assets which are monitored by the networked sensors and controlled by the intelligent decision-making algorithms. The relief of the production disruption by IM technologies facilitates the reconnection of the good and service flows in the network, which mitigates the severity of industrial chain disruption. In this study, we create a novel intelligent manufacturing framework for the production recovery under the pandemic and build an assessment model to evaluate the impacts of the IM technologies on industrial networks.

"© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: The increasing risk of natural disasters is challenging humanitarian actors to create resilient disaster management systems. However, the role of the private sector in disaster management operations (DMOs) is not as prominent as the role played by (inter)governmental agencies. This article aims to investigate the relationship of collaboration and resilience in disaster management supply networks (DMSNs). Design/methodology/approach: Supply network resilience criteria were defined as robustness, flexibility, velocity and visibility based on the literature review. DMSN capabilities were identified characterising each resilience criterion through the development of the Collaboration–Resilience (COLRES) Analysis Framework for DMSNs. This theoretical model was then applied to an empirical case study in the Philippines using semi-structured interviews for data gathering. Findings: A total of 46 cross-sector collaboration activities were identified across four disaster management phases and linked to the resilience criteria. A causal analysis of each collaboration activity and its outcome was conducted to identify relationships between collaboration types and resilience constructs. Based on these results, patterns were identified, and dependencies between collaboration and resilience were defined. Collective DMSN resilience (DMSNRES) enabled by existing cross-sector collaboration activities was evaluated against a future disaster scenario to identify resilience gaps. These gaps were used to recognise new cross-sector collaboration opportunities, thereby illustrating the continuous process of resilience building. Research limitations/implications: This research provides new insights on how private sector is involved within a DMOs through collaboration with the government and other NGOs. It augments existing literature on private sector involvement in DMOs where common perception is that the sector is only involved in short-term response and recovery activities. This study finds that the private sector can be operationally involved not just in post-disaster activities, but also in mitigation and preparation phases as well. This then sets a new baseline for further research on private sector involvement within DMOs. As this study provided a novel framework to analyse collaboration activities and its impact to DMSN resilience, future work could be done by applying the model to further cases such as other countries'. DMSNs, or to more specific contexts such as inter-organisational collaborations rather than big sectors. A more detailed assessment method against a future disaster will prove relevance for the model in providing practical insights on how resilience can be built in DMSNs. Practical implications: This research proposed a novel DMSN collaboration-resilience (COLRES) model (Figure 11) to analyse existing processes in preparation for specific disasters. Practitioners may be able to use this model with the goal of identifying resilience gaps to fill and continuously improve their processes. The model also provides practitioners the lens to improve processes with the perspective on collaboration to complement government and NGO efforts and expertise with those of the private sector. For the private sector perspective, this research provides new insights on how they can be more involved with the community to provide more sustainable and long-term contributions to the society. Social implications: With disasters becoming more complex and frequent by the day and as humanitarian actors focus on improving their expertise, the need for every piece of the society to contribute to disaster risk reduction is continuously intensified. This research shows that each sector of the society can take part in disaster management operations to reduce unpredictability, lives impacted and increase speed of response and recovery. Each sector of the society can be of great contribution not only during post-disaster response and recovery but also during pre-disaster mitigation and preparedness phase. As such, this research echoes the call for everyone to be involved in disaster risk reduction and mitigation as a way of life. Originality/value: This research ultimately finds that cross-sector collaboration builds resilience in DMSNs through capacity building, redundancy sourcing, information reliability and logistics responsiveness. This study shows that the private sector is able to go beyond existing short-term partnerships by participating in the 46 collaboration activities identified across four disaster management phases in order to build resilience in DMSNs.",A collaboration–resilience framework for disaster management supply networks: a case study of the Philippines,Collaboration *** COVID-19 *** Disaster management *** Earthquake *** Flood *** Pandemic *** Philippines *** Resilience *** Supply network *** Tsunami,journal of humanitarian logistics and supply chain management,85096207590,2020,,,,,,

"© 2020 The availability of bioethanol, a promising renewable alternative to fossil fuels depends on the supply of biomass produced from agricultural resources. The study attempts a system dynamics modelling approach to explore the implications of greenhouse gas concentration trajectories associated with climate change on bioethanol supply chains. Eight different climate change scenarios are simulated spanning over a 40-year horizon to predict biomass yield and bioethanol availability, by considering first generation (corn) and second generation (switchgrass) ethanol feedstocks. The developed model is used to assess the extent of potential disruptions resulting from global warming. Cascading effect of climate change risk is evident through decreased yield and production, and increased shortages at end customer in the bioethanol supply network. The results indicate that, if climate change risk is not adequately mitigated and current used source of ethanol (corn) continues to be leveraged, the bioethanol availability may decrease by one-fourth by the year 2060. The comparative study encourages exploring the increased use of switchgrass as a sustainable feedstock for renewable energy.

"© 2020 Elsevier B.V. To this day, sales & operations planning (S&OP) remains one of the most critical challenges of supply chain management in terms of improving customers’ experience level and managing supply chain costs. Nowadays the synchronization of sales essentials and industrial restrictions in an uncertain environment is critical for all global companies facing complexity in supply chain networks and operations systems. Sales and supply chain structures in build-to-order industries generally have cross-functional and conflicting objects that are not easily comparable. The current research is an extension of an innovative S&OP model within a more dynamically complex system in terms of demands uncertainty and unreliability of backup supplies. The promoted model is utilized for more efficient management and integration of industrial restrictions and sales essentials in global supply chain networks in terms of demand and supply coordination and responsiveness toward customers’ needs. Accordingly, this research has applied a simulation-based optimization approach to balance the trade-off between logistics cost and customers’ experience level as the main objectives. Two classes of strategies are offered for handling parts’ replenishment and flexibility to the sales structure. Initially, the proposed model evaluates two main inventory strategies’ performances. Thereafter, the optimized values of flexibility degree and safety stock fraction for corresponding inventory strategies are calculated by using a multi-objective simulation-optimization method. The investigation begins with an overall assessment of the system's performance.

"© 2020, Taiwan Fuzzy Systems Association. The nature of supply chains presents a variety of issues related to uncertainties. Under various uncertainties, risk management plays a crucial role in an effective supply chain decision-making. The uncertainty involved in the risk assessment process can be divided into two types: random uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. Fuzzy theory has been applied to deal with uncertainties. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the role and contribution of the fuzzy logic in the treatment of epistemic uncertainty into supply chain risk management approaches. A literature review process was performed, followed by analysis and discussions on the examined topic. The results revealed that the integration with multicriteria decision-making and disruptive analysis methods are the most common types adopted, with trend to petri nets and multicriteria decision-making approaches. Supply risks are the most studied type and identification and assessment are the most developed processes in supply chain risk management. Although the publications on the subject has been highlighted, they present some limitations related to the holistic complexity of risks in supply chains, the dynamic nature of the environment and the reliability of the background knowledge in the assessment.

Trying to meet the Sustainable Development Goals is challenging. Food supply chains may have to become more efficient to meet the increasing food requirement of 10 Billion people by 2050. At the same time, food and nutrition security are at risk from increasingly likely shocks like extreme climate events, market shocks, pandemics, changing consumer preferences, and price volatility. Here we consider some possibilities and limitations regarding the improvement of resilience (the capacity to deal with shocks) and efficiency (here interpreted as the share of produced food delivered to consumers) of food supply chains. We employ an Agent Based Model of a generic food chain network consisting of stylized individuals representing producers, traders, and consumers. We do this: 1/ to describe the dynamically changing disaggregated flows of crop items between these agents, and 2/ to be able to explicitly consider agent behaviour. The agents have implicit personal objectives for trading. We quantify resilience and efficiency by linking these to the fraction of fulfilment of the overall explicit objective to have all consumers meet their food requirement. We consider different types of network structures in combination with different agent interaction types under different types of stylized shocks. We find that generally the network structures with higher efficiency are also more sensitive to shocks, while less efficient network types display more resilience. At first glance these results seem to confirm the existence of a system-level trade-off between resilience and efficiency similar to what is reported in business management and ecology literature. However, the results are modified by the trading interactions and the type of shock. In our simulations resilience and efficiency are affected by ‘soft’ boundaries caused by the preference and trust of agents (i.e., social aspects) in trading. The ability of agents to switch between trading partners represents an important aspect of resilience, namely a capacity to reorganize. These insights may be relevant when considering the reorganization of real-life food chains to increase their resilience to meet future food and nutrition security goals.",An agent based model representation to assess resilience and efficiency of food supply chains, ,plos one,85096457517,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd Biomass is a valuable renewable source of energy as an alternative to fossil fuels. The main barriers in biomass and biofuel development are feedstock high cost, lack of reliable supply, and uncertainties. A systematic review of comprehensive solution tools to overcome the biomass supply chain (BSC) planning challenges is critical for both academic research and industry. Therefore, the aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review of BSC modeling and optimization and identify future research directions. We reviewed 300 papers that have been published in the past 40 years on this topic to assess the various models of BSCs, their objective functions, solution approaches, and decision levels employed. Results show that researchers are motivated to use mixed integer programming models for BSC problems because of the complexities of nonlinear models, as well as the simplicity of the linear approaches. There is a lack of multi-objective optimization approaches to address the economic, social, and environmental issues simultaneously in BSC. Although factors such as the political regulation, governmental subsidy, impact of biomass and oil price and cost of raw material are uncertain, most studies formally treat only the supply and demand of biomass as uncertain parameters. It is highly recommended that an integrated and holistic model that consider all facilities in the whole BSC be developed and tested with real data. In addition, incorporating strategic, tactical, and operational decision levels in the model is suggested to address the challenges of incorporating day-to-day inventory control and fleet management issues.","Biomass supply chain environmental and socio-economic analysis: 40-Years comprehensive review of methods, decision issues, sustainability challenges, and the way forward",Biofuel *** Biomass supply chain *** Optimization methods *** Sustainability *** Uncertainty,biomass and bioenergy,85091377194,2020,,,,,,

In this study, we propose coordination subject matters of a green supply chain with recycling perishable goods, involving suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, together with collection and disposal centers, in a multi-product, multi-period and multi-level basis under Fuzzy conditions. The consequences indicate that in dairy industries, appropriate collected returned products could be used as raw material for another product, which increases the supply chain profits and reduces waste; and also, since perishable goods have a limited shelf life, they can be reusable if they are collected before reaching to a critical time.

"© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. There has been a strong growth in aquatic products supported by the global seafood industry. Consumers demand information transparency to support informed decisions and to verify nutrition, food safety, and sustainable operations. Supporting these needs rests on the existence of interoperable Internet of Things (IoT) platforms for traceability that goes beyond the minimum “one up, one down” scheme required by regulators. Seafood farmers, being the source of both food and food-information, are critical to achieving the needed transparency. Traditionally, seafood farmers carry the costs of providing information, while downstream actors reap the benefits, causing limited provision of information. Now, global standards for labelling, data from IoT devices, and the reciprocity of utility from collecting data while sharing them represent great potential for farmers to generate value from traceability systems.

"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd As the destructive impacts of unbridled use of fossil fuels threaten the quality of life, moving towards renewable energy like solar power has precipitated. While such movements are commendable, environmental impacts of its infrastructure development should not be overlooked. In this sense, this paper addresses a multi-objective robust mathematical model to study an environmentally conscious solar photovoltaic supply chain under correlated uncertainty. The proposed model aims at minimizing the environmental impacts of included activities in the concerned supply chain in addition to minimizing the conventional cost objective. To quantify and assess the relevant environmental impacts, a life cycle assessment-based model is accomplished employing the ReCiPe 2008‏ approach embedded in the SimaPro software tool. The augmented ϵ-constraint procedure is deployed to optimize the proposed multi-objective model, which is able to attain compromise solutions from the Pareto-optimal set. Correlated uncertainty whose importance is underlined in the real-life situations of the photovoltaic industry is also tackled exploiting a robust optimization method. Ultimately, the validity of the presented model is vindicated through discussing a case study. The acquired results endorse the effectiveness and usefulness of the model and offer prominent practical and managerial insights.",An environmentally conscious photovoltaic supply chain network design under correlated uncertainty: A case study in Iran,Correlated uncertainty *** Environmental responsibility *** Life cycle assessment *** Multi-objective optimization *** Photovoltaic supply chain *** Solar energy,journal of cleaner production,85082846934,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd Since the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, partnerships between actors from different sectors and countries have been joining forces to tackle major sustainability challenges. Within the textile and clothing industry, inter-organizational networks and governance partnerships have worked to address labor rights violations and environmentally harmful modes of production. Although research on these networks and partnerships has been increasing, it has remained heterogeneous. It derives from many different disciplines and research communities, leaving behind an opaque field of literature. This article provides a critical overview and a comprehensive understanding of research on inter-organizational networks and governance partnerships of the textile and clothing industry through a systematic literature review. It analyzes 301 academic peer-reviewed articles published between 1992 and 2018. It uses quantitative full-text bibliometric word analysis, followed by coding around the meta-framework of modes of governance, which provides an integrative framework for this field of study. Firstly, this analysis revealed four discourses referred to as Economic and Industrial Development, Ecology and Environment, Private Labor Governance and Workers’ Rights, and Critical Ethnographies. Secondly, these four discourses were found to differ in their thematic sustainability challenges as well as in their variety of governance modes and partnerships. Research on economic sustainability tends to focus on modes of central and public-private governance; research on environmental challenges focus more on private governance of supply networks and; research on social sustainability tends to focus on more participatory, interactive and self-governing modes between multiple actors. The analysis provides a unique classification of scientific articles through modes of governance, which is helpful in positioning research in the debate, analyzing and comparing approaches and thus highlighting current gaps and opportunities for future research. The results indicate that both inter- and transdisciplinary collaboration is needed to address the identified dialectical and practical challenges, including increased involvement of research as a key actor in knowledge creation for governance and sustainability transformation within the textile and clothing industry.",Global partnerships for a textile transformation?

"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd Nowadays, sustainability issues have received considerable attention in supply chain management because of the governmental requirements as well as expectations of the people. This paper introduces a novel supply chain network design problem to cover three dimensions of sustainability, namely economic, environmental, and social. The advantage of the presented model stems from considering the booming development aligned with reduction in environmental impact. In this paper, to achieve the mentioned benefits and to derive a more sustainable supply chain, a novel model in the presence of the most commonly used carbon policies is proposed. This paper, addresses sustainable development through imposing proper carbon regulatory mechanisms. Main contribution of this study is to consider the effect of imposing carbon policies on environmental advantages as well as improving the regional development level in a supply chain network design problem. Moreover, the shipment consolidation decisions are utilized to reduce cost as well as environmental impact. In addition, a novel mixed uncertainty approach is proposed to capture the uncertain emission parameters. The numerical examples and a case study are analyzed to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. It is concluded that, a high-growth economy with low-carbon can be made and also almost global well-being of people is ensured by applying the proposed model. Some managerial insights are provided for the enterprises of supply chains to make the most appropriate sustainable decisions. Finally, proper carbon emission policies are suggested based on the region sustainability characteristics.",Achieving sustainable development of supply chain by incorporating various carbon regulatory mechanisms,Carbon policies *** Robust optimization *** Shipment consolidation *** Supply chain network design *** Sustainability,transportation research part d: transport and environment,85079902713,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers Reliability of facilities and vehicles in a supply chain and the social responsibility are of high importance in designing a supply chain network in many industries; fewer studies have studied the addressed concepts simultaneously. This paper proposes a multi-objective mixed-integer programming model for a multi-period multi-product supply chain considering conflicting economic and social responsibility objectives; furthermore, the reliability of the supply chain facilities and vehicles are integrated into the model rather than separate objectives. The possibility of disruption in the facilities of the supply chain is considered using the exponential distribution together with the effect of social responsibility as a significant pillar of sustainability. Various practical parameters such as accessibility of facilities, unemployment rate, number of created job opportunities, and level of regional development are considered in the modeling framework. Computational analysis is provided using the real dataset of a communication technology company as a case study to manifest the performance of the proposed model. A sensitivity analysis is performed for some specific parameters to recognize the most effective factors of the proposed model. The results can give good guidelines to the practitioners on the importance of considering network reliability and social responsibility as two important issues in network design problems.",Designing a multi-period production-distribution system considering social responsibility aspects and failure modes,Bi-objective optimization *** Network design *** Reliability *** Social responsibility *** Supply chain,sustainable production and consumption,85083593064,2020,,,,,,

Global change, that results from population growth, global warming and land use change (especially rapid urbanization), is directly affecting the complexity of water resources management problems and the uncertainty to which they are exposed. Both, the complexity and the uncertainty, are the result of dynamic interactions between multiple system elements within three major systems: (i) the physical environment; (ii) the social environment; and (iii) the constructed infrastructure environment including pipes, roads, bridges, buildings, and other components. Recent trends in dealing with complex water resources systems include consideration of the whole region being affected, explicit incorporation of all costs and benefits, development of a large number of alternative solutions, and the active (early) involvement of all stakeholders in the decision-making. Systems approaches based on simulation, optimization, and multi-objective analyses, in deterministic, stochastic and fuzzy forms, have demonstrated in the last half of last century, a great success in supporting effective water resources management. This paper explores the future opportunities that will utilize advancements in systems theory that might transform management of water resources on a broader scale. The paper presents performance-based water resources engineering as a methodological framework to extend the role of the systems approach in improved sustainable water resources management under changing conditions (with special consideration given to rapid climate destabilization). An illustrative example of a water supply network management under changing conditions is used to convey the basic principles of performance-based water resources engineering methodology.",Systems approach to management ofwater resources-toward performance basedwater resources engineering,Performance-based engineering *** Resilience *** Simulation *** Water resources systems,water (switzerland),85085990906,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020 by the authors. In the design of the supply chain, the use of the returned products and their recycling in the production and consumption network is called reverse logistics. The proposed model aims to optimize the flow of materials in the supply chain network (SCN), and determine the amount and location of facilities and the planning of transportation in conditions of demand uncertainty. Thus, maximizing the total profit of operation, minimizing adverse environmental effects, and maximizing customer and supplier service levels have been considered as the main objectives. Accordingly, finding symmetry (balance) among the profit of operation, the environmental effects and customer and supplier service levels is considered in this research. To deal with the uncertainty of the model, scenario-based robust planning is employed alongside a meta-heuristic algorithm (NSGA-II) to solve the model with actual data from a case study of the steel industry in Iran. The results obtained from the model, solving and validating, compared with actual data indicated that the model could optimize the objectives seamlessly and determine the amount and location of the necessary facilities for the steel industry more appropriately.",Robust multi-objective sustainable reverse supply chain planning: An application in the steel industry,Meta-heuristic algorithm *** Multi-objective planning *** Reverse supply chain *** Robust optimization *** Steel making industry *** Uncertainty,symmetry,85087052694,2020,,,,,,
"© 2019 After entering a new market (such as China and India), the full-fledged supply bases and networks (e.g., material, worker, logistics services, et al.) induce many multinational firms (MNFs) to produce and sell products using local materials. However, government's random environmental inspection, weather disaster, and other accidents have resulted in supply disruption for local sourcing. In this paper, we study how operational decisions such as pricing, ordering, and the selection of sourcing structure between Overseas Sourcing (OS) and Domestic Sourcing (DS) help improve supply chain sustainability. We study both the economic and environmental sustainability performances under alternative sourcing structures (OS and DS), where we identify a win-win situation. Interestingly, the MNF's profit difference between DS and OS is non-monotonic in its brand image advantage, because the domestic supplier might snatch the MNF's “brand value” using the pricing power, resulting a high local sourcing price. When the MNF's brand image advantage and the unit pollution/quantity ratio are both small, the MNF obtains more profits and incurs less pollutant under DS.",Multinational firms’ local sourcing strategies considering unreliable supply and environmental sustainability,Competition *** Sourcing strategy *** Supply disruption *** Sustainability,"resources, conservation and recycling",85076696478,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020 by the authors. Enterprises of the supply chain are currently embedded in dynamic and turbulent environments, having to deal with the appearance of disruptive events. When an enterprise is affected by a disruptive event, the consequences of the disruption not only impact in the enterprise itself, but also influences on the other partners of the network to which it belongs. Thus, disruptive events exceed the capability of individual actors, impacting on the network performance. Consequently, network partners have to collaboratively make decisions to soften the negative impacts on the performance. In this regard, after a disruption takes place, network enterprises should be aware of activating a set of sustainable and resilience strategies that attenuate the performance loss and reduce the disruption recovery time. Nevertheless, the diverse nature of disruptions means that a wide range of varied and sometimes contradictory strategies can be formulated, resulting in conflict situations among the collaborative network (CN) partners. The current paper proposes an approach that makes it possible to collaboratively manage the strategies to activate when a disruptive event occurs, so that the selected strategies are aligned. The strategies alignment approach, proposed in the paper, makes it possible to select those strategies that have a positive impact, or a minimum negative impact, on the objectives defined, not only in the enterprise itself, but also in the objectives defined by the rest of CN partners. The alignment of strategies makes it possible to reduce the performance level loss when a disruption takes place. Thus, the strategies alignment approach aims at activating those strategies that maximize the performance of the CN, achieving levels of performance equal or higher than the levels previous to the disruption, limiting the adverse effects produced by the disruptive events, and contributing to a more sustainable-resilient CN. Finally, in order to validate the proposal, a case study is presented. The proposed model is validated to deal with a drop in demand due to a political embargo, in a textile CN.",A strategies alignment approach to manage disruptive events in collaborative networks,Disruption recovery management *** Resilient collaborative network *** Strategies alignment *** Sustainable collaborative network *** Systems dynamic method,sustainability (switzerland),85083658891,2020,,,,,,

The Finnish forest industry is committed to applying novel technologies for increasing carbon-neutral development and environmental sustainability in ""green"" circular industry. This study compares the energy efficiency indicators of road freight transportation. Additionally, effects of four mass limits of vehicle combinations are analyzed after a three-year adaptation process that took place in a wood procurement region of 100% renewable resources. The wood-based energy efficiency model (load's wood energy/fossil transport energy) was the most accurate and precise measure as the development indicator. The indicator showed that the transportation systems (60, 64, 68, and 76 t) and (64, 68, and 76 t) were carbon negative (122, 133, 144, and 108) (142, 147, and 133) in 2014 and 2016, respectively. The numbers reveal positive energy ratio of renewable wood and fossil fuels. In comparison to 60 t, the use of 68 t vehicles increased energy efficiency most effectively in the systems, by 18.0% and 20.5%, respectively. The indicator robustly revealed the energy efficiency of a partial system in the smaller supply region, which depended on the region's transportation conditions. This novel knowledge can be applied for advancing the adaptation toward carbon-neutral supply networks. There is also the development potential of an industrial ecosystem model for optimizing the environmental sustainability of ""green"" circular industry.","Comparison of energy efficiency indicators of road transportation for modeling environmental sustainability in ""green"" circular industry",Carbon neutrality *** Energy efficiency *** Forest industry *** Renewable energy sources *** RES *** Sustainability,sustainability (switzerland),85083581784,2020,,,,,,
"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd Biomass polygeneration system is one of the most attractive biomass technologies due to its technicality, feasibility and high associated investment returns. The synthesis, design and economic aspects of constructing a processing system using this technology are well-developed and have recently reached the stage of industrial implementation. Nonetheless, the early stage of technology development focuses on process and product safety and tends to ignore other risk aspects that are closely associated with the biomass value chain. Due to the complex nature of the biomass value chain, conventional risk mitigation strategies are ineffective in mitigating risks at the management level. More recent approaches, particularly stochastic programming methods, have yielded robust results in addressing technological risks and design uncertainties. However, such approaches are still unable to effectively consider non-quantitative risks such as business risks and regulatory risks. Hence, this study proposes a combined method of an analytical model and stochastic programming approach to prioritize risks and risk mitigation strategies for decision-making purposes. This work presents a novel multiple-criteria decision-making expert system based on fuzzy set theory, which is the Decision and Evaluation-based Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (DEFANP) method. The novel method functions to prioritize risk mitigation strategies within a network relationship of project goals, key components of the biomass industry and industrial stakeholders. As the stochastic risk mitigation counterpart, the fluctuations and uncertainties in operations, transportation, market supply-demand and price are modeled using the Monte Carlo simulation method. From this, risks of implementing biomass polygeneration systems can be mitigated by selecting a strategy that yields the highest analytical indicator while reconciling with the corresponding probabilities of achieving management goals.

"© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: It is crucial to recognize that supply chain flexibility is important to build sustainable competitive edge in coping with uncertainty. This study puts forth an empirically supported integrative framework to understand supply chain flexibility from market-oriented and network-oriented perspectives, interrelationships among its dimensions and the effect of supply chain complexity as a contingent factor. Design/methodology/approach: The online survey data were collected from 201 manufacturing companies and checked for common method variance, validity and reliability. Structural equation modeling was then used to test the hypotheses. Findings: The results of this study demonstrate that there are interrelationships among market-oriented and network-oriented supply chain flexibility dimensions. It is the flexibility embedded in the supply chain network configuration that plays critical roles in superior performance in flexibility capabilities to create customer values. The interrelated effect among flexibility dimensions is contingent on the magnitude of the supply chain complexity corresponding to the number of supply chain tiers. Originality/value: This study takes a step to advance understanding of supply chain flexibility from an integrative point of view consisting of market-oriented and network-oriented perspectives. This study is expected to provide practitioners the foundation to implement supply chain flexibility considering the interrelationships among flexibility dimensions.

"© 2019 The effects of disruption in both supply chain and its infrastructures like power network have not been addressed in previous works, simultaneously. Besides, disruption risks have environmental effects besides their economic effects. For this purpose, this paper studies a resilient-green closed loop supply chain design problem considering the perishable nature of products and disruption risks in both supply chain and power networks. To cope with disruptions five different risk mitigation strategies are employed. We have developed an integrated bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model to minimize the expected total network cost and the expected total amount of carbon emissions of both networks. The results demonstrate that applying strategy of integrating interdependent networks along with four other resilient strategies, especially “intermediate facility” and “lateral transshipment” strategies, will improve the performance of integrated network significantly.

"© 2019, The Author(s). Effective design of biodiesel supply chain network can reduce many of its high production costs. There are various uncertain parameters in real world that if ignored may greatly affect the optimal configuration of the designed biodiesel supply chain. Scenario planning is a powerful tool which can help the decision makers for long-term planning under uncertainties. Therefore, in this paper, a scenario-based robust optimization model is presented for designing the biodiesel supply chain networks under uncertainties. Some of the parameters including demand, supply, costs, and environmental impacts have uncertain nature. For the first time, in this study, the values of these uncertain parameters are estimated by a proposed scenario-planning method. The presented scenario-planning approach is based on cross-impact analysis and visualization methods. Non-edible sources such as Jatropha, Norouzak, and waste cooking oil are considered as raw materials of biodiesel production, and for the first time Norouzak has been used as one of the sources in designing biodiesel supply chain. In addition, an environmental constraint is considered and the environmental impacts of all processes are obtained by Eco-indicator 99 method. The presented model can determine the number, location, and capacity of the facilities. The proposed model is implemented in a real case study in Iran for a 7-year planning horizon.

"© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Circular economy is an alternative to the traditional production model and has therefore attracted a great deal of attention fromresearchers. The change in the production system is accompanied by new logistical needs related both to resources and waste and to the distribution and recovery of products. The circular supply chain involves return processes and the manufacturer intends to capture additional value in the supply chain. In this paper, value chains have been mapped to visualize the links and interactions between the different stages and actors to understand the complexities of these systems and to make informed decisions. For this reason, and based on thorough literature review, the final objective of this work is to achieve a conceptual framework to study circular supply chain, which uses the main theoretical perspectives in strategic management literature. Four dimensions have been identified to support the development of these new supply chains-greater intensity in the relationships established in the supply chain, adaptation of logistics and organizational, disruptive and smart technologies, and a functioning environment. It can be concluded that to develop a new relationship capacity will allow for reaching more frequent, closer relationships with more actors. These relationships will be developed within an adapted organizational and logistical framework that is framed in new business model archetypes.

In recent decades, the confluence of different global and domestic drivers has led to progressive and unpredictable changes in the functioning and structure of agri-food markets worldwide. Given the unsustainability of the current agri-food production, processing, distribution and consumption patterns, and the inadequate governance of the whole food system, the transition to sustainable agriculture and food systems has become crucial to effectively manage a global agri-food market able in supporting expected population growth and ensuring universal access to suffcient, safe, and nutritious food for all. Based on a critical review of the existing international literature, the paper seeks to understand the evolutionary paths of sustainability issues within agri-food markets by analyzing their drivers and trends. An extensive analysis was conducted highlighting the development and importance of the body of knowledge on the most important sustainability transition frameworks, focusing mainly on the relationship between markets, trade, food and nutrition security, and other emerging issues within agri-food markets.

"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd We develop a sustainability performance measurement framework for supplier evaluation and selection, using the Analytic Network Process (ANP) method. Even though the literature is rife with studies that deal with the supplier selection problem, companies that actively pursue sustainability strategies may need to add metrics that show suppliers’ sustainability performance. Existing models for measuring sustainability performance are limited in that they either evaluate the environmental and social performance separately, do not consider the inter-relationships between metrics across the three dimensions of sustainability, or utilize metrics that are difficult to obtain and evaluate accurately. To overcome this deficiency, we use the ANP method, that takes into account the interrelations between quantifiable and easy to obtain sustainability-related evaluation metrics. First, through an extensive literature review and feedback from an experts’ panel, we select and classify salient sustainability performance metrics related to supplier evaluation. With data collected through an extensive survey amongst 144 supply chain professionals in the UK and France, we develop the interdependencies between several sustainability metrics and determine the most critical metrics by calculating their relative weights. Results show that the selected socio-economic metrics carry the most relatively important role in supplier selection. Based on the findings of the study, we discuss implications for theory and practice. The proposed evaluation system can provide details on observing sustainable supply chain performance. It can also help to get a clearer insight into sustainability with a well-established quantitative decision-making process so that business strategies can be developed with more concerns on supply chain sustainability.",Supplier sustainability performance evaluation using the analytic network process,Analytical network process *** Sustainability performance *** Sustainable supplier selection,journal of cleaner production,85076309908,2020,,,,,,
"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd The requirement of environmental improvement has led to the innovative emergence of shared bicycles. The production and recycling of shared bicycles are a closed logistics network, which can be considered a typical closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) problem. In practice, the CLSC network is influenced by social, economic and environmental factors, which impose high degrees of uncertainty and usually trigger various unanticipated risks, so controlling uncertain parameters becomes a key issue in supply chain decisions. The purpose of this research is to construct a new distributionally robust optimization model for a multi-product, multi-echelon CLSC network, in which the distributions of uncertain transportation cost, demand and the returned product are only partially known in advance. In the proposed model, robust mean-CVaR optimization formulation is employed as the objective function for a trade-off between the expected cost and the risk in the CLSC network. Further, to overcome the obstacle of model solvability resulting from imprecise probability distributions, two kinds of ambiguity sets are used to transform the robust counterpart into its computationally tractable forms. Finally, a case study on a Chinese bicycle-sharing company is addressed to validate the proposed robust optimization model. A comparison study is conducted on the performance between our robust optimization method and the traditional optimization method. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is performed with respect to the risk aversion parameter and the confidence level.",Distributionally robust design for bicycle-sharing closed-loop supply chain network under risk-averse criterion,Ambiguity set *** Bicycle-sharing *** Closed-loop supply chain *** Distributionally robust optimization *** Mean-CVaR *** Risk,journal of cleaner production,85074436404,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020 by the author. Consumer products such as clothes and footwear sometimes contain chemical substances with properties that pose a risk to human health and the environment. These substances, restricted by law or company policy, are in focus for chemicals management processes by textile retailers. However, complex and non-transparent supply chains, and limited chemical knowledge, makes chemicals management challenging. Therefore, a function-based approach for life cycle management (LCM) of chemicals was developed, based on results of previous projects and evaluated using a two-step Delphi process. The resulting approach aims to help retailers identify and substitute hazardous substances in products, and consists of three parts: (i) a function-based chemicals management concept model for different levels of chemical information within the supply chain, (ii) tools for non-chemists which explain chemical information, and (iii) a continuous provision of knowledge to stakeholders (e.g., retailers) in a network. This approach is successfully implemented by over 100 retailers in the Nordic countries, providing the textile industry with practical and robust tools to manage and substitute hazardous chemicals in products and production processes. We conclude that the developed approach provides an explicit link, communication, and knowledge sharing between actors in the supply chain, which has proven important in chemicals LCM.",A function-based approach for life cycle management of chemicals in the textile industry,Chemicals management *** Implementation *** Knowledge sharing *** LCM practice *** Leather *** Life cycle management (LCM) *** Retail *** Substitution *** Textile,sustainability (switzerland),85081256954,2020,,,,,,

The research consisted of a single case study with the following steps: literature review, identification of the gaps, concepts synthesis, and case study. The findings indicated theoretical and empirical guidelines for SDGs. The literature review indicated the relevance of exploring some approaches to achieve sustainable supply chain management: corporate social responsibility, green supply chain management, industrial ecology, stakeholder theory, circular economy (reduce, reuse, and recycle with economic prosperity), and sustainability science. The focal company plays a strategic role in the vertical integration operation of the Brazilian poultry supply chain. The case study findings indicate the role of the focal company toward the actors, including the feed mill supplier, live poultry transport, poultry processor, rendering plant, and distributor. However, much remains to be accomplished to answer the question “how to be sustainable?“, especially in environmental and social issues involving all actors in the poultry supply chain. The Brazilian environmental legislation still needs to be revised to be aligned with SDGs because the legislation will not guarantee sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources.

"© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: This paper aims to design an optimal supply chain network and to develop a suitable distribution planning under uncertainty for perishable product's supply chain. The ultimate goal is to help in making decisions under uncertain environments. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, stochastic programming is used under conditions of demand, supply and process uncertainties, and a non-linear mathematical model is developed for perishable product’s supply chain. Authors’ study considers disruptions in transportation routes and also within the facilities and investigates optimal facility location and shipment decisions while minimising the total supply chain cost. A scenario-based approach is used to model these disruptions. The retailer level uncertainty due to demand-supply mismatch is handled by incorporating the newsvendor model into the last echelon of supply chain network. In this paper, two policies are proposed for making decisions under uncertain environments. In the first one, the expected cost of the supply chain is minimised. To also consider the risk behaviour of the decision maker, authors propose the second policy through a conditional value-at-risk approach. Findings: Authors discuss the model output through various examples that are provided via a case study from the milk industry. The supply chain design and planning of the disruption-free model are different from those of the resilient model. Practical implications: Authors’ research benefits the perishable products industries which encounter the disruption problems in their transportation routes as well as in the facilities. Authors have demonstrated the research through a real-life case in a milk industry. Originality/value: The major contribution of authors’ work is the design of the supply chain network under disruption risks by incorporating aspects of product perishability.

"© 2019 Process systems engineering (PSE) has been an active research area for nearly seventy years and addresses multiple systems from the process industry. Among these are Process Supply Chains that can be described as interconnected sets of entities responsible for the sourcing, production and distribution of a large set of chemical and/or bio- based products. Due to the high diversity of materials, processes and information flows such networks result in highly complex systems that are very difficult to manage. The PSE community has a critical role to support the design and management of such systems through the development of tools that are able to address such complexity. Focusing initially on a real-world process supply chain, the industrial gas supply chain, this paper identifies and discusses current contributions, challenges and perspectives in process supply chains that can guide research professionals to address such challenges. In general, such challenges encompass supply chain scope representations, modeling approaches, data management and implementation.

"© 2019, © 2019 The Chinese Institute of Engineers. Traditional supply chain management focuses on operational and financial factors, such as improving operational efficiency and reducing cost. Since global warming has become critical, researchers and managers of the supply chain have paid more attention to environmental issues. With the environmental factor, the complexity in designing an optimal supply chain network essentially increases. This research considers a multi-objective (minimal total cost and CO2 emissions) supply chain network design with environmental factor (SCNDEF), which includes the features of multiple echelons, stochastic demands, production/storage capacity, environmental investment, and multiple time periods. In order to help managers make decisions about the SCNDEF, this research performs sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of key parameters, such as customers’ satisfaction level and limits on CO2 emissions, on the performance of the supply chain network. Numerical examples are given to verify the proposed methodology. The results show that a good SCNDEF can not only improve the performance of the entire supply chain but also achieve sustainable environmental protection. These research findings are intended to serve as practical reference for industry.",Supply chain network design with multi-time-period stochastic demands for optimizing dual objectives on economic and environmental factors,Environmental factor *** multi-objective optimization *** Pareto efficiency frontier *** stochastic demands *** supply chain network design,"journal of the chinese institute of engineers, transactions of the chinese institute of engineers,series a",85075578699,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020, © 2020 Chinese Institute of Industrial Engineers. One of the basic requirements of the companies to survive in real-world competitive environments is to make their supply chains as efficient as possible. Due to recent governmental regulations, environmental issues, and the development of the concept of social responsibility, the closed-loop supply chain management has been focused by many researchers. A closed-loop supply chain includes both forward and reverse supply chain networks with the purpose of combining environmental considerations with the traditional supply chain network designs through the collection of used products and activities related to their reuse. In this paper, a bi-objective, multi-period, multi-product, closed-loop supply chain network is designed under environmental considerations, discounts, and uncertainties. The deterministic model of the chain is first solved by three multi-objective decision-making methods. Then, based on real-world uncertainties involved in some of the parameters, a robust optimization model is proposed and solved using decision-making methods. At the end, the best deterministic and robust models are selected based on the displaced ideal solution.","A robust optimization approach for multi-objective, multi-product, multi-period, closed-loop green supply chain network designs under uncertainty and discount",discount *** Green supply chain *** multi-objective decision-making methods *** robust optimization *** uncertainty,journal of industrial and production engineering,85082661202,2020,,,,,,

In addition, back order of products, which leads to dissatisfaction of customers, was noted and for different customers, different levels of importance are assumed to consider social impacts. To handle the problem of unpredicted parameters, a novel approach of uncertainty, which is named Hybrid Robust Possibilistic Programming-II (HRPP-II), is used. At last, a case study will be solved by the Improved Augmented ϵ-Constraint method (AUGMECON2) to achieve Pareto solutions, and some sensitivity analysis will be done.

"© 2019, © 2019 International Society of Management Science and Engineering Management. In recent years, sustainability has been considered as a growing concern in supply chain network design (SCND). Due to legal requirements, economic profitability, environmental sensitivity, and awareness of customers, sustainable supply chain management has been important for government and industry over the years. The aims of this research are to propose a bi-objective mathematical programming model to integrate the flows of the entire chain to improve performance in conditions of uncertainty associated with the plastic injection industry. The proposed model seeks to minimize total costs including transportation costs, operating costs and fixed costs of setting up facilities and on the other hand, is looking to minimize the environmental emission to increase customer satisfaction. The model proposed based on two scenarios has been solved through the robust optimization approach. Also, to solve the proposed model, some of the multi-objective exact methods such as the weighted sum, weighted goal programming, and LP-metric method are used. Furthermore, a weight sensitivity analysis is applied to find the best set of weights for the objectives.

It is understood that digital technologies like blockchain can be helpful in achieving certain Sustainable Development Goals linked to livelihoods, food security, and the environment, by identifying issues and implementing interventions in real-time. However, there is limited understanding over data structure requirements for blockchain technology implementation in digitally-enabled food supply chains. Therefore, this research studies the design of blockchain-centric food supply chains that promote Sustainable Development Goals, within the context of the Thai fish industry. Key findings suggest that data asymmetry exists in supply chains to achieve Sustainable Development Goals. This research presents four design principles and an integrated technology implementation framework, derived from empirical data, for blockchain-centric food supply chains.

"© 2020 American Institute of Chemical Engineers The design of sustainable supply chains, which recently emerged as an active area of research in process systems engineering, is vital to ensure sustainable development. Despite past and ongoing efforts, the available methods often overlook impacts beyond climate change or incorporate them via standard life cycle assessment metrics that are hard to interpret from an absolute sustainability viewpoint. We here address the design of biomass supply chains considering critical ecological limits of the Earth—planetary boundaries—which should never be surpassed by anthropogenic activities. Our method relies on a mixed-integer linear program that incorporates a planetary boundaries-based damage model to quantify absolute sustainability precisely. We apply this approach to the sugarcane-to-ethanol industry in Argentina, identifying the optimal combination of technologies and network layout that minimize the impact on these ecological boundaries. Our framework can find applications in a wide range of supply chain problems related to chemicals and fuels production, energy systems, and agriculture planning.",Designing biomass supply chains within planetary boundaries,absolute sustainability *** bioethanol *** life cycle assessment *** optimization *** supply chain management,aiche journal,85099607239,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020, Springer Nature B.V. In recent years, due to governmental legislation, environmental groups’ pressures, customer green expectation, etc., closed-loop green supply chains have gained paramount consideration. Accordingly, this study develops a novel multi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming model for a closed-loop green supply chain network design problem. The proposed model aims to minimize the total costs, total CO2 emissions, and robustness costs in both forward and reverse directions, simultaneously. To cope with flexible constraints and epistemic uncertainty in the model’s parameters, a robust flexible-possibilistic programming approach is tailored. The model is solved using an efficient interactive solution approach, in which, the presented model is analyzed under various carbon emission mechanisms to assess the influence of these mechanisms on the achieved solution. An illustrative example in the copier industry is also provided to validate the applicability of the presented optimization model.

Nowadays, oil price fluctuation, fossil fuel depletion, and the potential environmental impact of these energy resources are highly threatening the global economy. Developing renewable resources, hence, is quite unavoidable. Sugarcane, as a source of renewable energy, can be converted to bioethanol. Therefore, this study has proposed a mixed-integer linear programming to design an international network of the sugarcane-to-biofuel supply chain. To deal with uncertainty, the robust optimization approach is employed in order to maximize the profit earned from the bioethanol sales at the foreign/domestic markets, minimize the environmental impacts caused by these supply chain activities, and maximize this network generated employment. The multi-echelon supply chain model involves different production/storage capacities, bio-refineries technologies, and transportation modes. This supply chain configuration has specified the optimal production capacity/technology, the appropriate transportation mode in each route, and the bio-refineries’ development capacities. The biofuel export price and the domestic/foreign markets’ demands are among the SC uncertain parameters addressed through the robust possibilistic programming. Finally, the tri-objective model has been solved using an approach that considers the decision maker’s preferences; the model performance has been verified by a case study performed in Iran.

Health care is in crisis today: costs are rising, demand exceeds supply, quality is questioned and patient wait times are excessive while providers and staff are simultaneously overworked and frustrated. No one has a comprehensive system solution to providing more, cheaper, better, and faster health care, even in primary care practices, the first link in the health care supply chain. Additionally, this link like others frequently experiences the combination of complexity, uncertainty, and local optimisation simultaneously to create a chaotic environment. Health care problems have been called ill-structured (also “wicked”) and because of their tangled web of stakeholders with different and conflicting objectives defy traditional optimisation research methodologies. Proper design and management of the provider appointment scheduling system (PASS) provides a direction for a win–win health care solution (more, cheaper, better, and faster). Our objective is to provide a generic strawman process for developing a robust PASS for most environments. A theory of constraints thinking processes (TP) analysis was conducted on the academic research using a primary care practice to validate both entity and causality existence. From this integrated analysis, a robust process for designing a PASS resulted.

According to environmental considerations, the traditional supply chain has replaced with a closed-loop supply chain. This study attempts to design the polyethylene tanks closed-loop supply chain network under uncertainty. The proposed network contains various levels such as suppliers, manufacturing plants, distribution warehouses, and retailers. A mixed integer linear programming model is developed with a single-objective, multiple products and multiple periods. Besides, after-sales service is considered that has economic and environmental effects on the supply chain and leads to customers’ satisfaction and loyalty. To deal with uncertainty, possibilistic programming is used. Therefore, some parameters of the model are considered as a fuzzy number with a triangular probability distribution. Also, a method based on decision tree and discounted cash flow is utilized to analyze the problem in multiple periods. Furthermore, to validate and show the applicability of the proposed model, a real case study is performed in the polyethylene tanks industry. Finally, the sensitivity analysis is used to check the robustness of the proposed model and framework. The results show that the net present value of the supply chain under new condition is increased by 0.8%.

"© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate how sub-suppliers decouple the implementation of sustainable supply management practices in supply chains, and what institutional logics permit these suppliers to do so. Design/methodology/approach: Following a qualitative design, we conducted 23 in-depth semi-structured interviews with owners and managers of apparel sub-suppliers. To corroborate research findings, the views of owners and managers were triangulated by further interviewing 18 key representatives of wide-ranging institutional actors. Findings: The findings suggest that owners and managers of sub-suppliers use two decoupling responses: (1) consensual strategy to compromise sustainability requirements (2) concealment strategy. In addition, this paper identifies multiple institutional types of conflicting logics: instrumental logic, legitimacy logic complexity and gaps in normative logic, which interplay amongst sub-suppliers whereby permit to decouple the implementation of supply management practices. Research limitations/implications: While the current paper provides an early contribution from the perspectives of second-tier and third-tier suppliers, future research could be extended to include further upstream sub-suppliers and downstream tiers including the end consumers. Practical implications: It is important for brand-owning retailers and first-tier suppliers to predict sub-suppliers' decoupling behaviour and conflicts for supply management practices implementation since they may present potential vulnerability for buyers and lead suppliers. Originality/value: This study extends the application of institutional theory and contributes to the literature on extended suppliers' supply management practices in a developing country context, which is an under-researched area.",The hidden side of sub-supplier firms' sustainability – an empirical analysis,Apparel industry *** Consensual and concealment strategies *** Developing country sub-suppliers *** Institutional theory *** Sustainable supply management,international journal of operations and production management,85087553035,2020,,,,,,

Research on supply chain (SC) digitalization, resilience, sustainability and leagility has remarkably progressed, most of it focused on the individual contributions of these four major frameworks. However, a lack of integration spanning these individual frameworks can be observed. In this conceptual paper, we hypothesize that reconfigurability can be considered such an integral perspective that consolidates the research in SC adaptation to ever changing environments. We theorize a new notion – a Reconfigurable SC or the X-network–that exhibits some crucial design and control characteristics for complex value-adding systems in highly vulnerable environments. We support our argumentation and conceptual viewpoints by a literature analysis along with tertiary studies to review and structure contextual factors of designing the X-networks. We propose respective frameworks and discuss the implementation principles and technologies at the macro and micro levels. Two novel concepts–dynamic SC meta-structures and dynamic autonomous services–are introduced. Distinctively, we go beyond the existing knowledge to predict proactively the future directions in the reconfigurable SCs.

"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd In supply chain systems, the entities supplier, manufacturer and distribution center make up the communication platform, which can obtain the data of production, stock, demand, etc. The cyber-physical system (CPS) typically involves multiple computational platforms interacting over communication networks. In the CPS, when the supply chain is disturbed and interruption occurs, supply chain resilience measurement is important to reduce order losses in the supply chain. In this paper, firstly, according to the operational characteristics of different resilience measures, strategy of the supply chain in the interrupted environment is described. Secondly, based on the cost composition of the supply chain operating in the interrupted environment, measurement model of supply chain resilience is established. Thirdly, by introducing the time that the customers can wait as an indicator to represent the external demand environment of supply chain, the customer expectation can be distinguished quantitatively, and the customer expectation factor can be integrated into the measurement model of supply chain resilience. Finally, based on the measurement model of supply chain resilience, quantitative results of the supply chain resilience measurement are obtained, and the relationship between the results and resilience measures is analyzed based on resilience analysis, which illustrates the relationship between the unit capital investment and its ability to reduce order losses.",A resilience measure for supply chain systems considering the interruption with the cyber-physical systems,Cost *** Customer expectations *** Interruption *** Resilience *** Supply chain,reliability engineering and system safety,85081026448,2020,,,,,,
"© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature. Closed loop supply chain network design (CL-SCND) is a critical economic and environmental activity. The closing of the loop to handle return, uncertainty in business environment, various supply chain risks, impact network design processes and performance of the firm in the long term. Thus, it is important to design robust and reliable supply chain structures and obtain network configurations which can always outperform the other configurations under the worst cases of risks and uncertainty. A generic closed-loop supply chain network based on mixed integer programming formulation is proposed with direct shipping to the customer from manufacturing plants as well as shipping through distribution centers under supply risks, transportation risk and uncertain demand using a robust optimization (RO) approach. A large number of numerical tests are carried out to test the performance of the model by considering a total of four levels of uncertainty for four different network structures types. The results of the tests confirm that the risk and uncertainty based integrated supply chain network models are more efficient (cost effective) than the other set of network configurations which treats the supply chain risks and uncertainty post-ante. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model, the case of an Indian e-commerce firm which wants to redesign its supply chain structure is presented. The results of case study show that the topology obtained from integrated treatment of risk and uncertainty called as RORU model, outperform other supply chain networks on various network performance indicators such as supply chain costs, the number of facilities open or close and the amount of products flowing through supply chain echelon.

As policies and regulations related to environmental protection and resource constraints are becoming increasingly tougher, corporations may face the difficulty of determining the optimal trade-offs between economic performance and environmental concerns when selecting product technology and designing supply chain networks. This paper considers weight reduction technology selection and network design problem in a real-world corporation in China which produces, sells and recycles polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles used for soft drinks. The problem is addressed while taking consideration of future regulations of carbon emissions restrictions. First, a deterministic mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to analyze the influence of economic cost and carbon emissions for different selections in terms of the weight of PET bottle, raw material purchasing, vehicle routing, facility location, manufacturing and recycling plans, etc. Then, the robust counterpart of the proposed mixed-integer linear programming model is used to deal with the uncertainty in supply chain network resulting from the weight reduction. Finally, results show that though weight reduction is both cost-effective and environmentally beneficial, the increased cost due to the switching of the filling procedure from hot-filling to aseptic cold-filling and the incumbent uncertainties have impacts on the location of the Pareto frontier. Besides, we observe that the feasible range between economic cost and carbon emission shrinks with weightreduction; and the threshold of restricted volume of carbon emission decreases with the increase of uncertainty in the supply chain network.",Weight reduction technology and supply chain network design under carbon emission restriction,Carbon emission *** Product development *** Supply chain networks *** Sustainability *** Weight-reduction technology,annals of operations research,85032681313,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd Southern Rock Lobster (SRL) is an important commercial export fishery of the Australian economy with a contribution of $250 million annually. However, a range of risks relating to food safety and product fraud requires this industry to develop an effective traceability solution. In response to this biometric identification techniques are seen as a possible solution to provide greater security compared to the current tag-based tracking systems. This paper describes how a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be used in conjunction with image processing techniques to enable an autonomic grading solution in the SRL supply chain. The research is an essential part of an overall investigation into designing a low-cost biometric identification solution for tracking lobsters along their supply chain from catch to table. By using a CNN, the research aims to improve the previous research on lobster grading in establishing a reliable and flexible traceability method to meet different supply chain contexts. In this approach, a pre-trained Mask-RCNN model was adopted to extract regions of interest from lobster images. The deep learning ability of this model allows the carapace areas to be segmented from lobster images automatically for calculating grading attributes including size, weight and colour. This outcome then also generates a high-quality input dataset for the follow-up research on identifying individual lobsters. To prove the effectiveness, the proposed method was validated on a large image dataset collected at a lobster processor and tested on mobile application environment.

"© 2020 John Wiley  &  Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment Perishable food supply chains (PFSCs) are characterized with rising food quality and safety concerns, alarming food wastages and losses, and poor economic sustainability. Because of the perishable nature of products and limited shelf life, management of sustainability in PFSCs is critical. Many studies on sustainability in PFSCs have considered developed countries; however, developing countries have not gathered the required research attention in this domain. In this paper, a decision theory-based framework is adopted, where a prescriptive decision analysis methodology is used to generate preferences among the challenges to sustainability in PFSC. An integrated interpretive structural modelling–analytic network process (ISM–ANP) decision framework is formulated to identify and model key challenges to sustainability in PFSCs, keeping a developing economy like India under consideration. The contextual relationships amongst the extracted challenges are analyzed using the ISM methodology. The relationships identified from ISM are used as inputs in the ANP methodology, to generate the priority weights of the challenges. The findings of the integrated methodology show that “lack of horizontal integration of farmers,” “poor pre-harvest management,” and “lack of government regulation and support” are the most critical challenges for sustainability in PFSCs. The results show that organizations must work on aggregation of farm produce and integration of farmers with the market. Development of infrastructures and cold chain facilities at the farm level is necessary to mitigate these challenges to reduce wastages in PFSC.

Smallholder livestock farmers (SLF) are important in research and policy development agenda because of the everlasting issue of food insecurity and the livelihoods in sub-Sahara Africa. Lack of access to technologies and information, poor infrastructure and lack of access to markets and environmental factors play a key role in deterring sustainable smallholder livestock farming. In recent years, studies have provided evidence that livestock species can play a role towards solving household food insecurity and enhancing Africa’s resilient livelihoods, particularly in rural settings. However, no studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of emerging technologies (available information technologies) as risk mitigation tools for smallholder livestock farmers. The study used survey data from 278 interviewer-administered questionnaires and 13 in-depth interviews village herds from Dumba, Mapayi, Old Nuli and Shabwe to explore whether rural SLF would use the emerging technologies to enhance their operations, and mitigate supply chain risk, exposures to stock theft and loss. Empirical results show the overwhelming need for the use of emerging technologies by the SLF, and that emerging technologies have significant and positive effects on the risk management activities. SLF indicated that, using digital technologies, they could enhance their risk mitigation and value chains. The results of the study have several policy implications. For instance, the agricultural comparative advantage should be improved through various emerging agricultural technologies. Moreover, the immediate rural development service networks for SLF could be strengthened through the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform to reduce livestock risk exposures, disasters and market reactions.

This paper is to investigate the influence of different granular compositions (recycled coarse and fine aggregate) on the mechanical characteristics and durability of concrete. Five series of concrete mixes, manufactured with various granular combinations (natural/recycled), were studied The formulation of the reference concrete was based on a constant quantity of 400 kg/m3of cement and a constant workability of fresh concrete securing S2 class of flowability and C25/30 concrete class, according to European standards. The experimental program consisted of comparing the long-term mechanical strength of concrete conserved in different types of water baths: fresh tap water sourced directly from the supply network, deionized water, and salt water. Also, the durability indicators were observed, such as capillary water absorption, porosity accessible to water, helium gas permeability, and an ammonium nitrate leaching test. The obtained results have highlighted the superiority of concrete composed of natural aggregate over concrete incorporating recycled aggregate for mechanical behaviour, case-observed with three types of water used as a conservation bath. The replacement of natural aggregate by recycled aggregate does not provide any substantial improvement in terms of durability.

"© 2020 Coal byproducts represent an abundant and untapped potential source of critical rare earth elements (REEs). In this study, we tested the efficacy of a biosorption-based approach to recover REEs from leachate solutions derived from North Dakota lignite coal and Powder River Basin (PRB) coal fly ash. A pairwise comparison was performed using a range of cell densities of two distinct bacteria, including an Escherichia coli strain previously genetically engineered for cell surface display of lanthanide binding tags, and Arthrobacter nicotianae, a native bacterium that exhibits high REE adsorption capacity. At optimal cell densities, we observed a recovery efficiency of 80% for total REEs and > 90% for middle and heavy REEs from the lignite leachate. Higher cell densities were required to achieve a similar total REE recovery efficiency in the PRB leachate due to its higher non-REE content, which negatively impacted light REE recovery. Despite the chemical complexity of both feedstocks, separation factors ≥ 30 were observed for Nd relative to nearly all non-REE metals after a single adsorption/desorption cycle, highlighting the high adsorption selectivity for REEs. Quantification of impurities in the extracted metal solutions revealed that Ca and Mg content in the leachate solutions play a dominant role in both the REE recovery yield and purity. The Mg/Ca impurities can be further reduced by incorporation of a low pH wash step between the adsorption and desorption steps, yielding extracted concentrates with a REE purity (mass fraction REE of total metals) of 80% and 50% for lignite and PRB, respectively. Thermodynamic speciation analysis of the REE-enriched eluents from both feedstocks suggests that at a post-biosorption hydroxide precipitation step can be employed to yield high purity total REE precipitates. Collectively, these results highlight the utility of biosorption for selective REE recovery from coal byproducts and pave the way for a sustainable route to diversify the REE supply chain.",A biosorption-based approach for selective extraction of rare earth elements from coal byproducts,Biosorption *** Coal *** Coal combustion products *** Critical material recovery *** Rare earth elements,separation and purification technology,85079883346,2020,,,,,,

The increasingly global context in which businesses operate supports innovation, but also increases uncertainty around supply chain disruptions. The COVID-19 pandemic clearly shows the lack of resilience in supply chains and the impact that disruptions may have on a global network scale as individual supply chain connections and nodes fail. This cascading failure underscores the need for the network analysis and advanced resilience analytics we find lacking in the existing supply chain literature. This paper reviews supply chain resilience literature that focuses on resilience modeling and quantification and connects the supply chain to other networks, including transportation and command and control. We observe a fast increase in the number of relevant papers (only 47 relevant papers were published in 2007–2016, while 94 were found in 2017–2019). We observe that specific disruption scenarios are used to develop and test supply chain resilience models, while uncertainty associated with threats including consideration of “unknown unknowns” remains rare. Publications that utilize more advanced models often focus just on supply chain networks and exclude associated system components such as transportation and command and control (C2) networks, which creates a gap in the research that needs to be bridged. The common goal of supply chain modeling is to optimize efficiency and reduce costs, but trade-offs of efficiency and leanness with flexibility and resilience may not be fully addressed. We conclude that a comprehensive approach to network resilience quantification encompassing the supply chain in the context of other social and physical networks is needed to address the emerging challenges in the field. The connection to systemic threats, such as disease pandemics, is specifically discussed.",Trends and applications of resilience analytics in supply chain modeling: systematic literature review in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic,COVID *** Epidemics *** Policy *** Resilience *** Risk *** Supply chain,environment systems and decisions,85085597123,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd The evolution of international supply chains have created a constant need for the transportation of goods through maritime transport. This mode of transport has been beneficial through its efficiency in the mobility of a large quantities of merchandise. In this context, inland waterway ports are one of the mainstays of the maritime transportation network. The aim of this paper is (1) to model and assess the interdependency between inland port infrastructure and its surrounding supply chain and (2) to show how the disturbance in one will have a ripple effect and trigger cascading failures in the entire network. To comprehend this interconnectedness, we outline three thorough interdependency types: geographic, service provision, and access for repair. After these interdependency types are validated, the factors related to port disruption and its supply chain performance are identified, and the Bayesian network is applied to visualize the interdependency among these factors. The quantification of interdependency is examined, and the results are profoundly analyzed through different advanced techniques such as belief propagation and sensitivity analysis. The general interpretation of these analyses entails that environmental factors and supplier responsiveness are imperative to port disruption and supply chain performance, respectively.",Modeling and assessing interdependencies between critical infrastructures using Bayesian network: A case study of inland waterway port and surrounding supply chain network,Bayesian network *** Critical infrastructure interdependency *** Inland waterway port *** Port performance *** Port supply chain *** Risk and resilience,reliability engineering and system safety,85080880910,2020,,,,,,

"© 2020 The Author(s). Scarcity of fossil fuels and their emissions have led energy policymakers to look for alternative renewable and clean energy sources. In line with this target, biomass is a promising alternative source for the generation of clean energy and the development of a sustainable society. The use of animal and agricultural wastes is one of the very promising renewable energy alternatives paving the way for a more sustainable energy network. Animal and agricultural wastes as biomass sources do not endanger food security and mitigate environmental impacts and may therefore considerably contribute to an appropriate waste management. As a result, converting animal and agricultural wastes to energy is a challenging issue that has attracted the attention of academic and industrial researchers. A multi-echelon multi-objective model is developed to design a sustainable supply chain for bioenergy generation through the anaerobic digestion process. The model maximizes economic and social objective functions, representing direct economic profits and positive social externalities such as job creation and economic development, respectively. Factors affecting the international supply chain include imports of intermediate production equipment, exports of a final product, international business terms applied, customs duties, and foreign exchange rates. Bioenergy and fertilizers are outputs considered in this study; the former to be converted to electricity in a biogas plant to meet domestic demands, and the latter to be exported. A case study for the Golestan province is used to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed model. The results support the potential for three biogas power plants in Gonbad-e-Kavoos, with an annual production capacity of about 1000 tons of fertilizer and an electricity supply for 101,556 households per month. There is still a broad field of promising avenues for future research.

"© 2019 The Authors International trade plays a critical role in global food security, with global consumption having highly localized environmental impacts. It has been difficult to gain insights into these effects due to the diversity of food production, and complexity of supply chains in international trade. We present a Spatially-explicit Multi-Regional Input-Output (SMRIO) model which couples primary crops and livestock at a high spatial resolution with a global Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) model. We then identify hotspots (the most significant production regions) for primary crops and livestock driven by international consumption. We present the method and data behind this approach, and provide illustrative case studies for Indonesian palm oil and Brazilian soy and beef production. Regionally, China is the largest primary crop consumer, while the EU28 is the largest livestock consumer. Primary crops and livestock hotspots are highly unequal, and the embodied primary crops and livestock for high-income countries are distributed over larger areas when compared to lower-income countries since high-income countries have more numerous trade links. Identified hotspots could allow for increased cooperation between consumers (high-income countries) and producers (lower-income countries) to improve sustainability programs for global food security.",Linking global crop and livestock consumption to local production hotspots,Animal husbandry *** Multi-regional input-output (MRIO) analysis *** Primary crops *** Spatially explicit,global food security,85072749400,2020,,,,,,

He had to fulfill all the orders to achieve his personal and organizational goals. He was excited as he was supposed to be promoted and transferred to Head Office on a national role, after a successful annual closing. It was not too late when his excitement turned into anxiety when he received a never expected direct call from Director Sales. Around 7:00 p.m., he was informed of some new orders for an important institutional customer, which was out of his own region. The orders were placed in Ali’s region because of stocks’ availability. Ali had no time to plan this huge order and there were no dispatch trucks available at that time. Should Ali take risk of organizational goals and his promotion and cancel those orders? Should Ali generate sales invoices to record sales and dispatch the stocks on next day compromising the organizational core values and policies? Complexity academic level: BBA.

"© 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  &  Francis Group. An intertwined supply network (ISN) is an entirety of interconnected supply chains (SC) which, in their integrity secure the provision of society and markets with goods and services. The ISNs are open systems with structural dynamics since the firms may exhibit multiple behaviours by changing the buyer-supplier roles in interconnected or even competing SCs. From the positions of resilience, the ISNs as a whole provide services to society (e.g. food service, mobility service or communication service) which are required to ensure a long-term survival. The analysis of survivability at the level of ISN requires a consideration at a large scale as resilience of individual SCs. The recent example of coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak clearly shows the necessity of this new perspective. Our study introduces a new angle in SC resilience research when a resistance to extraordinary disruptions needs to be considered at the scale of viability. We elaborate on the integrity of the ISN and viability. The contribution of our position study lies in a conceptualisation of a novel decision-making environment of ISN viability. We illustrate the viability formation through a dynamic game-theoretic modelling of a biological system that resembles the ISN.

"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd Ensuring a consistent and regular availability of food is crucial for food security. Food markets, supplied through both domestic production and international trade, are governed by several risks emerging from unpredictable supply chain disruptions, volatility of commodity prices, along with other unforeseen circumstances such as natural disasters. To mitigate the challenges threatening the stability of food systems, decision-making within the food sector should be enhanced and robust to accommodate any changes that might cause food shortages. Dynamic models, that can predict the behavior of food systems in order to avoid potential future knock-on effects and deficits, are incumbent to ensure the sustainable performance of food systems. This study proposes a dynamic decision-making scheme that simulates strategies of the perishable food market under different circumstances. An agent-based model (ABM) is developed and implemented using python MESA library for a case study in Qatar, illustrating the potential performance of tomato under three different scenarios to be considered, namely: (a) baseline scenario - aiming to reflect current production and market conditions; (b) water resource efficiency scenario - basing decisions on crop water requirement (CWR) depending on weather conditions; and (c) economic risk scenario - applying the concept of forward contracts to hedge against future uncertainties in crop prices. The findings of this study demonstrate that under the baseline conditions, a tomato crop can be supplied through a combination of domestic production and imports depending on the available inventories and prices imposed by exporters. The results obtained for the CWR scenario suggest the need for total reliance on imports in order to meet domestic demand, as there is potentially high-water loss, which amounts to an average of 4.9 Billion m3 per year, if tomato is grown locally. In contrast, the results from the forward contract scenario recommend a 57% dependency on local production in order to mitigate the effects of volatility in global food prices, which contributes to a 63% reduction in environmental emissions. Findings of this research provide insight into the factors that influence strategic decision making by the food sector to enhance its economic and environmental performances under diverse circumstances.",Sustainable food security decision-making: An agent-based modelling approach.,crop water requirement *** Food trade *** Forward contracts *** Nexus *** Virtual water,journal of cleaner production,85078698899,2020,,,,,,
"© 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  &  Francis Group. With increasing global exposure, organisations have started to witness supply chain risks that they traditionally were not exposed to. This article therefore attempts to answer the research question of how environmental uncertainty within a firm’s supply chain, impacts firm financial performance. We further evaluate the role of supply chain risk management practices in mitigating the negative impact of such disruption events. To answer the research question, we conduct a literature review and develop the corresponding hypothesis. We test our hypothesis using both primary and secondary data. The results show that environmental uncertainty has a negative impact on firm financial performance, with entrepreneurial managerial capitalism mediating the impact. However, organisations that adopt macro and network supply chain risk management practices are able to improve managerial decision making frame, and mitigate the negative impact of environmental uncertainty on firm financial performance.

This paper aims to unlock the unlicensed band potential in realizing the Industry 4.0 communication goals of the Fifth-Generation (5G) and beyond. New Radio in the Unlicensed band (NR-U) is a new NR Release 16 mode of operation that has the capability to offer the necessary technology for cellular operators to integrate the unlicensed spectrum into 5G networks. NR-U enables both uplink and downlink operation in unlicensed bands, supporting 5G advanced features of ultra-high-speed, high bandwidth, low latency, and improvement in the reliability of wireless communications, which is essential to address massive-scale and highly-diverse future industrial networks. This paper highlights NR-U as a next-generation communication technology for smart industrial network communication and discusses the technology trends adopted by 5G in support of the Industry 4.0 revolution. However, due to operation in the shared/unlicensed spectrum, NR-U possesses several regulatory and coexistence challenges, limiting its application for operationally intensive environments such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation systems, and energy. Thus, we discuss the significant challenges and potential solution approaches such as shared maximum channel occupancy time (MCOT), handover skipping, the self-organized network (SON), the adaptive back-off mechanism, and the multi-domain coexistence approach to overcome the unlicensed/shared band challenges and boost the realization of NR-U technology in mission-critical industrial applications.

"© 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature. Although supply chain network design under uncertainty has been studied by many researchers, most stochastic programming approaches in this area assume uncertain parameters follow certain distribution functions. However, in practice, the true distributions may be ambiguous and some historical data are available. This study proposes a data-driven two-stage stochastic programming model to obtain robust decisions among all possible distributions in a defined ambiguity set based on the moments of available data. In accordance with the proposed stochastic program, a solution algorithm based on Benders’ decomposition is developed. Further, the social concerns corresponding to the supply chain network are derived and quantified by the social life cycle assessment methodology. The proposed model is applied for designing a recovery network in which various technologies use generated municipal solid wastes for the power generation. Computational results on a real-life case study demonstrate the applicability of the proposed data-driven two-stage stochastic model as well as the impact of considering social concerns on the design decisions.",A data-driven approach for supply chain network design under uncertainty with consideration of social concerns,Data driven *** Social concerns *** Social-life cycle assessment *** Supply chain network design *** Two-stage stochastic programming,annals of operations research,85079729484,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020 by the authors. The increasingly dynamic and volatile market environment has elevated the importance of handling operational risks in supply chain networks. Also, black swan risks are constantly evolving and can strike from almost anywhere, including natural disaster, cyber risk, or viruses. As more companies are outsourcing their logistics to third-party logistics (3PL), at the same time, supply chain risks and uncertainties are also shifted to 3PLs. A 3PL's supply chain network capability to assure continuity can be expressed in terms of resilience, i.e., the ability of sensing and responding to disturbances or threats. Operations research/management science (OR/MS) methods have been widely applied in supply chain management. The objective of this paper is to look into research regarding the development of resilient 3PL supply chain network designs through the utilization of OR/MS methods. After extensive literature review, a so called pro-silience framework is developed aiming at improving resilience from a 3PL perspective maintaining or increasing its competitive advantage during and after major disruptions, yet also maintain competitiveness under normal operating conditions. Additionally, the framework offers insights into topics for future research.",Towards a pro-silience framework: A literature review on quantitative modelling of resilient 3PL supply chain network designs,Black swan disruptions *** Competitive advantage *** Literature review; 3PL *** OR/MS *** Pro-silience *** Quantitative models *** Resilience *** Supply chain network design,sustainability (switzerland),85085684916,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020 The Authors Cobalt is considered a critical raw material. Global cobalt demand is expected to quadruple in the next four decades, due primarily to lithium-ion battery demand. Uniquely, this study provides detailed geographically explicit data on the cobalt supply chain, with the aim of both determining how susceptible primary cobalt production is to supply chain disruptions, and to evaluate possible supply risks. We conclude that the risks for supply chain disruptions are high. Firstly, the cobalt market is highly concentrated, with more than half of the cobalt mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and almost half of the cobalt refined in China. Secondly, almost all cobalt is mined as a by-product of copper and nickel. Finally, political stability in production countries is considered to be medium to very weak. There are also several factors in play that reduce supply risks. The concentration of the individual mines, refineries and companies remains under the threshold of a concentrated market, and the estimated 80 artisanal cobalt mines further diversify the mined supply. A network analysis shows the important position of companies with high betweenness and degree centrality. A disruption at these companies can affect the functioning of the overall supply chain. The geographic and a network visualization provide useful insights in the supply risks. Based on the analysis, we recommend to diversify cobalt production, through the development of mines, refineries, and efforts to ensure socially and environmentally sustainable artisanal mining.",Identifying supply risks by mapping the cobalt supply chain,Cobalt supply risk *** Metals criticality *** Network analysis *** Sustainable resource management,"resources, conservation and recycling",85079157507,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020 AEDEM Supply chain disruptions have serious consequences for society and this has made supply chain risk management (SCRM) an attractive area for researchers and managers. In this paper, we use an objective literature mapping approach to identify, classify, and analyze decision-making models and support systems for SCRM, providing an agenda for future research. Through bibliometric networks of articles published in the Scopus database, we analyze the most influential decision-making models and support systems for SCRM, evaluate the main areas of current research, and provide insights for future research in this field. The main results are the following: we found that the identity of the area is structured in three groups of risk decision support models: (i) quantitative multicriteria decision models, (ii) stochastic decision-making models, and (iii) computational simulation/optimization models. We mapped six current research clusters: (i) conceptual and qualitative risk models, (ii) upstream supply chain risk models, (iii) downstream supply chain risk models, (iv) supply chain sustainability risk models, (v) stochastic and multicriteria decision risk models, and (vi) emerging techniques risk models. We identified seven future research clusters, with insights from further studies for: (i) tools to operate SCRM data, (ii) validation of risk models, (iii) computational improvement for data analysis, (iv) multi-level and multi-period supply chains, (v) agrifood risks, (vi) energy risks and (vii) sustainability risks. Finally, the future research agenda should prioritize SCRM's holistic vision, the relationship between Big Data, Industry 4.0 and SCRM, as well as emerging social and environmental risks.",Decision-making models and support systems for supply chain risk: literature mapping and future research agenda,Bibliometrics *** Multicriteria decision *** Risk model *** Stochastic and computational model,european research on management and business economics,85081280974,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020 This commentary explores how blockchain technology is being leveraged to improve marine conservation and fisheries supply chain management globally. In doing so, the paper considers the technical and political challenges of building trust and equity for various stakeholders. A blockchain is a smart electronic database, distributed to all users, immutably tracking every transaction that has ever taken place on the network. The blockchain is very difficult to hack, with no single point of authority to make mistakes and collapse the system. Automated consensus protocols enable data transmitted on the network to be verified and stored immutably, minimising the risk of data corruption to near-zero. Blockchain is being increasingly hyped for a range of services and industries, including transparent resourcing for marine conservation, reducing pollution from plastics, reducing slavery at sea, and sustainable fisheries management. Public distrust in some conservation operations, as well as in the provenance of seafood, is growing. Although some global marine conservation organisations and seafood producers have found practical solutions in disruptive technologies like blockchain, riding this wave will only prove worthwhile if coastal communities and artisanal fishers are on board and stand a chance of landing a fair share of the benefits.",Building trust and equity in marine conservation and fisheries supply chain management with blockchain, ,marine policy,85079383087,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd Stable natural-gas supply and reduction of distribution disruptions play a crucial role in the socio-economic wellbeing and support sustainable development. The socio-technical nature of disruption compels implementation of an interdisciplinary perspective using a lens of supply-chain management. In this manner, disruption drivers are present in the internal, network, and environmental categories. Further, a quantitative method is necessary to evaluate and minimize the occurrence and effect of disruptions by promoting capability development. Therefore, natural-gas-supply security (NGSS), as a hierarchical and multi-dimensional construct, is considered to develop these capabilities. The effect of NGSS on mitigating gas-distribution disruptions, which is based on the contingency theory, is investigated to shed light on what a company should do to mitigate disruptions. Structural equation modeling is also applied to analyze the data collected through a survey questionnaire in Tehran Province Gas Company. The results show that NGSS, in the context of disruption mitigation at the company level, consists of three main dimensions: availability, infrastructure, and governance. The findings suggest that availability can be achieved by not only a sufficient supply but also efficient energy use. Further, behavioral and technological changes are essential. In addition, policies and regulations are not sufficient to develop governance; thus, structure, systems, and monitoring should be emphasized. The conclusion of this study provides an empirical basis and some insights into capabilities that aim to mitigate disruptions. These capabilities can provide reinforcement to transparency, trust, risk-management culture, and integrated supply–demand approach to prevent fluctuations in gas availability, thus promoting infrastructure that deals with environmental sustainability and subsequently addresses disruptions.",Developing natural-gas-supply security to mitigate distribution disruptions: A case study of the National Iranian Gas Company,Disruption mitigation *** Energy security *** Gas distribution *** Governance *** Infrastructure,journal of cleaner production,85077741711,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is one of the hydrocarbon fuels with the least carbon footprint having a rapidly rising global share in the prime energy market. LNG processing for transportation at longer distances works under cryogenic conditions, especially when used for liquefaction and gasification applications. The supply chain of the eco-environmental friendly hydrocarbon is heavily dependent on the processing plant used for liquefaction and subsequent re-gasification of the natural gas. Plate-fin heat exchangers are extensively used in the LNG industry for both re-gasification as well as liquefaction processes. The exchange of heat during the process of natural gas phase change involves plate-fin heat exchangers working under cryogenic low-temperature conditions. The heat exchangers are designed to have brazed joints that are most vulnerable to failure under these temperature conditions. One failure of such a joint can not only hinder the supply chain but also may result in fire and life hazards. In almost all earlier studies, analytical and numerical methods were used to analyze these braze joints using finite element method methods and examining the stresses while keeping them at or near to ambient conditions. In this research, the plate-fin heat exchanger is investigated for its structural stability of brazed fins for three different fin configurations: plain, wavy and compound having different joint geometries. In addition, the analyses are carried out using experimentally measured brazed joint strength which is measured to be on average 22% lower than the base material strength owing to brazing process and resultant heat-affected zone (HAZ). Therefore, the reliability is assessed for these joints in terms of factor of safety (FOS) while keeping in view the actual yield criteria. It was found that the structural stability of compound fins configuration is weakest amongst all considered fin configurations. The failure of the compound fin brazed joint is expected to be along the horizontal path of the joint due to yielding. The study also predicts the life of the fin brazed joints in different joining directions with different topologies of fins commonly recommended in the literature. It is observed that the commonly recommended safe fin geometries are predicted to be susceptible to failure if a reduction in the brazed joint is considered. The analysis and recommendation in this paper shall provide a reliable and safe design approach for plate-fin exchangers for different operating conditions especially in low to cryogenic temperature applications.",Predicting the structural reliability of LNG processing plate-fin heat exchanger for energy conservation,ANSYS *** Fins *** Plate-fin heat exchanger *** Structural stability,energies,85084580258,2020,,,,,,
"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd Motivated by a real-world case, this paper deals with uncertainty issues in the resilient and sustainable electricity supply chain network design. Uncertainty is always found in electricity demand prediction and perfect foresight is not possible. The resilience of electricity networks in face of uncertainty can prevent catastrophic impacts. Besides, due to the growing concerns about social impacts, considering social measures along with the other measures is becoming critical when analyzing the network costs. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization model is developed, which consists of the total cost in the first objective, resiliency measures in the second objective, and some aspects of corporate social responsibility in the third objective. The resiliency measures minimize de-resiliency, including successive establishment, distributed generators inadequacy, congestion through electrical lines, and energy dissatisfaction level. A novel robust approach is also proposed to deal with the uncertainty of electricity demand based on the light robust programming and possibilistic theory in the fuzzy logic. By investigating a real case in Iran, the contributions of the considered measures, and the effects of uncertainty are analyzed. The analyses reveal that by applying the proposed model the decision-makers can enhance corporate social responsibility and resiliency by 50% and 20%, respectively, although it increases the total cost by 50%. Moreover, the results of applying the proposed fuzzy-robust approach show that how the decision-makers can effectively allocate the uncertainty budget and protection level to attain more robust solutions in terms of standard deviation and mean value of the total cost.",Innovative strategy to design a mixed resilient-sustainable electricity supply chain network under uncertainty,Corporate social responsibility *** Electricity supply chain network design *** Fuzzy-robust programming *** Resiliency *** Uncertainty,applied energy,85092083200,2020,,,,,,

From a supply chain perspective, new technologies such as blockchain can improve the efficiency and competitiveness of logistics and increase customer satisfaction. Although blockchain technology has been lauded as a way for firms to build sustainable supply chain networks, the rate of acceptance of this technology remains low. Therefore, this study seeks to identify the factors that discourage firms from merging blockchain with the supply chain. Instead of providing further reasons for adopting blockchain technology, we try to understand what deters firms from adding blockchain to their operations. Following the deductive approach, a confirmatory factor analysis is conducted on pre-test questionnaires to test, improve, and verify the constructs (questions) to measure the hypothesized factors. A theoretical model is proposed based on the hypotheses, and structural equation modeling is applied. The results are estimated using the partial least squares approach and a sample of 83 respondents. Our findings based on our empirical data support most of our hypotheses. We find that various factors impede the adoption of blockchain technologies, including technological barriers, constraints rooted in organizations and the environment, and system-related governmental barriers.

In this environment, operations like planning and control are critical to enhance agri-food supply chains performance and decisions, which are considered complex mainly because the presence of a high variety of information and variables that are required to be managed simultaneously. Hence, the use of a combination of methods, methodologies and multidisciplinary approaches are one of the key trends in research to handle these complexities. The purpose of this is to benefit the agri-food sector by identifying sustainable solutions that will enhance social opportunities, as well as livelihoods, local and national economies. From this, impacts are expected in terms of providing stakeholders with validated scenarios to improve agri-food supply chain resilience, establish agri-food decision-making guidelines to enhance agriculture quality delivery and strengthen agri-food stakeholders position in local and global supply chains. However, since the interdependencies between agri-food stakeholders are related to several agri-food activities, resources and systems, the establishment of collaborative business models across the agri-food supply chain has turned more important than ever, specially to support global agri-food supply chains, food safety and traceability in response to the sustainable global challenges. Therefore, aligned with the H2020 RUC-APS research project, this research focuses in addressing key decision-making challenges in agri-food supply chain environments by connecting key operations management methodologies to collaborative research approaches in the regions of Europe, Asia and South America.

"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd Evaluating the performance of supply chains (SC) is a critical activity to enhance the outcomes of operations along the SC tiers. In order to support this evaluation process, several studies have proposed the application of artificial intelligence techniques combined with the performance metrics suggested by the SCOR® model (Supply Chain Operations Reference). However these propositions present some limitations. While the systems based on Mamdani fuzzy inference do not allow adaptation to the environment of use based on historical performance data, the systems based on artificial neural networks are not adequate to deal with imprecise data and qualitative metrics. In order to overcome these limitations, this paper presents a new approach to support SC performance evaluation based on the combination between the SCOR® metrics with an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS). In total, 56 candidate topologies were implemented and assessed using MATLAB. The random subsampling cross-validation method was applied to select the most appropriate topological parameters for each ANFIS model. The mean square error between the target values and the values estimated by each ANFIS model demonstrate its greater accuracy of prediction. In addition, results of the hypothesis tests based on paired samples indicate that the proposed ANFIS models are adequate to support SC performance evaluation. The proposed system can help managers to develop improvement actions plans based on the outcomes of the evaluation process. When compared to previous approaches, it presents advantages such as greater accuracy of prediction, learning ability based on historical data, suitability to support decision making under uncertainty, better interpretability of results, among others.",An adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system to supply chain performance evaluation based on SCOR® metrics,ANFIS *** Neuro-fuzzy systems *** SCOR® model *** Supply chain management *** Supply chain performance evaluation,computers and industrial engineering,85075540031,2020,,,,,,
"IEEE To reinforce competitiveness, companies must focus on competitive priorities including cost, quality, delivery, and flexibility. The competitiveness also depends on the adherence to environmental requirements and the ability of companies to survive unforeseen disruptions. Lean, agile, resilient, and green (LARG) paradigm is a hybrid supply chain paradigm, which can enhance competitiveness in today&#x0027;s complex markets. In this article, we propose a new conceptual decision-making model to evaluate LARG supply chain performance in medical equipment companies. In this regard, supply chain operations reference model attributes were utilized as performance evaluation criteria. Furthermore, the appropriate practices of LARG supply chain are selected through fuzzy Delphi method. Also, an extension of decision making trial and evaluation laboratory-based analytic network process method is proposed to uncover network relationships and obtain the weights for dimensions and elements. According to the results, the agile paradigm, responsiveness, and quick introduction of new products are determined as the most prioritized elements in their corresponding dimensions, which emphasize the importance of the customer satisfaction. Finally, the extended hesitant fuzzy linguistic VIKOR (Vlsekriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje) is applied to rank LARG performance of Iranian needles and syringes companies via qualitative group decision-making process.

Companies are attaching more and more importance to sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) as which makes the right strategy measures for companies. Due to the complexity of external environmental factors and internal structure, sustainable supply chain management is vulnerable to various risks. The purpose of this paper is to present a new two-stage approach for determining the best practitioner in Iran Pars Special Economic Energy Zone based on the sustainable supply chain risk management (SSCRM). The best and worst method (BWM) is used to determine the weight of risk factors. Then the method of linguistic value soft set is used to assess the impact of risk factors on each company's sustainable supply chain which is a multiple attribute decision making problem with language preference in the second stage. Consequently, the ranking results of sustainable supply chain of each enterprise are obtained. This study contributes to finding the key risk factors of SSCRM. Evaluating these companies SSCRM with preference information, the best practitioner can obtain. The combination of BWM and linguistic value soft set approach provides a new nonparametric theoretical method and tool for this kind of decision-making problems with this background. At the same time, the conclusions of this study have guiding significance for the implementation of industrial supply chain.

"© 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  &  Francis Group. A robust bi-level model of the single-product multi-period network design problem is proposed for a competitive green supply chain considering pricing and inventory decisions under uncertainty and disruption risks. The bi-level programming approach is used through this model to demonstrate the competition among two supply chains; the leader and the follower, respectively. After modelling the competition and applying pricing decisions by defining a price-dependent demand, disruption risks are analysed through the model. The proposed model simultaneously considers demand uncertainty and disruption risks and is capable of dealing with such uncertainties by implementing resilience strategies including, inventory decisions, and having a contract with reliable suppliers. Moreover, to consider the environmental issues, controlling CO2 emissions and managing the reverse flow were added to the model. Our approach to mitigate the problem uncertainties is to use the possibilistic programming method. The Karush-Kuhan-Tucker (K-K-T) optimality conditions are deployed to make a single-level equivalent form. Since the integrated model was bi-objective, the ϵ-constraint method is implemented to make a single objective integrated model.

Such decisions are difficult in this environment as managers encounter uncertainty and risks. The study investigates establishing or moving distribution facilities in the global supply chain by considering costs, fulfilment, trade uncertainties, risks under environmental trade-offs and disruptive technologies. Design/methodology/approach: This paper combines the possibilities and probabilistic scenarios for a supply chain network by proposing the novel Robust Optimisation and Mixed Integer Linear Programming (ROMILP) method developed under the potential uncertainty of demand while considering the costs associated with a four-tier supply chain network. ROMILP has been solved in a real-time logistics environment by applying a case study approach. Findings: The solution is obtained using an exact solution approach and provides optimality in all tested market scenarios along the proposed global logistics corridor. A sensitivity analysis examines potential facility location scenarios in a global supply chain context. Research limitations/implications: Logistics managers can apply the ROMILP model to test the cost-benefit trade-offs against their facility location and relocation decisions while operating under uncertainty. Future research is proposed to extend the literature by applying data from the OBOR logistics corridor.

"Copyright © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd. Imposition of strict environmental protection acts and the imperative need of the best possible allocation of resources have given birth to the concept of low carbon logistics. Environmental laws force the manufacturers to extend their existing supply chains to form a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) through the setup of an efficient recovery system. In this paper, a multi-objective robust optimisation model is proposed for the design of CLSC network under uncertainty. First, a deterministic bi-objective mixed integer linear programming (BOMILP) model is developed for designing a CLSC network. Then, the robust counterpart of the proposed BOMILP is presented to cope with the real-world uncertainty. The first objective aims to maximise the total profit generated in the CLSC network and the second objective minimises the environmental pollution of the CLSC network. The proposed bi-objective model is solved using a multi-choice goal programming (MCGP) approach.",A robust bi-objective programming approach to environmental closed-loop supply chain network design under uncertainty,Closed-loop supply chain *** CLSC *** Environmental issues *** MCGP *** Multi-choice goal programming *** Robust optimisation,international journal of mathematics in operational research,85082191188,2020,,,,,,
"© 2019 Elsevier B.V. In addition to the great importance of minimizing total cost, resiliency and social indicators have a special place in the agricultural food supply chain. In this respect, a novel multi-objective model is developed that addresses the design/redesign wheat supply chain network, which comprises several suppliers, existing silos, candidate locations for establishing silos, flour factories, and demand zones in an uncertain environment. To develop the mathematical model, two additional and essential dimensions of the supply chain including social impact and resiliency are simultaneously considered. This model is the integration of several proper indicators of resiliency, social responsibility dimensions through considering three objective functions to minimize the cost, non-resiliency, and negative impacts of social responsibility. Due to the fact that input parameters taint with inherent uncertainty, a hybrid stochastic fuzzy-robust programming is introduced, and four different hybrid approaches are developed. Finally, to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model as well as solution methodology, a real case study is provided. The obtained results show that simultaneously considering cost, resiliency, and social impacts can significantly assist to improve the performance of the wheat supply chain. Moreover, making trade-off between mentioned measures can help the decision-makers to have the principled preference.",A novel hybrid approach for synchronized development of sustainability and resiliency in the wheat network,Corporate social responsibility *** Hybrid programming *** Multi-objective optimization *** Resiliency *** Wheat supply chain,computers and electronics in agriculture,85076216772,2020,,,,,,
"© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. Abstract: In this work, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming model to address the design and planning of a multi-feedstock lignocellulosic bioethanol supply chain network. In order to provide resiliency against existing epistemic uncertainties and disruption risks in the supply chain, a hybrid robust stochastic-possibilistic programming approach is employed. The proposed model minimizes total expected cost of the supply chain over non-disruption and disruption scenarios while limiting greenhouse gas emissions for sustainability considerations. The model determines the optimal supply chain strategic and tactical decision variables such as location, capacity and technology of biorefineries, transportation modes, shipments, inventory levels and production and import amounts. The performance of the model is evaluated through a real case study developed in Iran. Comparing the proposed resilient model with its non-resilient counterpart reveals that the proposed model is superior both in cost and GHG emissions reductions.

The decision makers should design resilient supply chain networks that can encounter disruptions. This paper develops an integrated resilient model for supplier selection and order allocation. Resilience measures including quality, delivery, technology, continuity, and environmental competences were explored for determining the Resilience Weight (RW) of suppliers. Fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Analytic Network Process (ANP) methods were applied to finding the overall performance of each supplier. Then, the developed mathematical model maximized the overall performance of suppliers while minimizing total cost of network. The proposed mathematical model helps the decision makers to select supplier and allocate the optimum order quantities by considering shortage. Since the disruptive incidents are inevitable events in real-world problems, the impact of disruptions on suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers has been considered in the proposed model. Inherent uncertainties of parameters were taken into account to increase the compatibility of the approach with realistic environments. To tackle the uncertainty and multi-objectiveness of the proposed model, interval method and TH aggregation function were adapted.

To immune the network against disruptions, a new resiliency approach is proposed by extending efficient demand coverage plans. The developed model includes four objectives. The first objective minimizes the total costs of the network along with maximizing the coverage of customers’ demand. As a new concept, the second objective maximizes the operational reliability of facilities to extend a consistent and responsive tire supply chain. Also, to design a sustainable network, the third objective function minimizes CO2 emissions in the strategic and tactical planning horizons. Moreover, the fourth objective maximizes the social responsibility of the network via introducing new social factors.

This kind of environment requires consideration of the economical aspects, the technical aspects, the safety/quality of supply, and consumer preferences. The major contributions introduced in the presented approach are the following. A nonlinear formulation is adopted to capture the nonlinear thermal models and the nonlinear algebraic model of the heat supply network. The second major contribution is the economic character of the objective following the assumption of a liberalized market environment. Such formulation accounts for the specifics of the energy market organization. Finally, the stochastic nature of the planning problem is introduced through a practical robust formulation.

"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd The growing environmental consciousness resulted from global climate changes has aroused petrochemical industries to search for the renewable alternatives for fossil fuels. Recently, biomass has been received increasing attention due to its economic and environmental benefits. Olefin, as one of the key raw materials in petrochemical industries, is able to be produced from biomass feedstocks. This study presents a robust three-stage stochastic programming model to characterize and optimize an olefin supply chain/production network aiming to provide a reliable and economic logistics network to support olefin production. This model encompasses probabilistic scenarios and uncertainty sets to capture the seasonality of biomass feedstocks and the uncertainty of carbon tax rate, respectively. The Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is also involved in this model to complement the traditional biomass supplies to ensure the reliable feedstock for olefin production. To find the optimal solution of this model, a hybrid robust/stochastic approach is developed by integrating the affinely adjustable robust model with the sample average approximation (SAA) method. The state of Mississippi is used as a real case study to test and validate the proposed model and optimization approach. The results show that increasing feedstocks conversion rate by 20% and MSW recycling rate by 100% will increase olefin production by 17.26% and 14.3%, respectively, and increasing the carbon tax rate uncertainty from 0 to 30 will decrease the total network emissions by 2.8%. The proposed optimization approach will generate more robust and reliable results. These results indicate that the proposed model and optimization approach would benefit both economic and environmental perspectives in biomass based olefin production.",Sustainable olefin supply chain network design under seasonal feedstock supplies and uncertain carbon tax rate,Affinely adjustable robust counterpart model *** Olefin supply chain/production network *** Sample average approximation,journal of cleaner production,85063250961,2019,,,,,,

The sustainability measure of MFT can be viewed as a lever to uplift freight transportation sustainability. The MFT sustainability assessment involves several subjective criteria, incomplete criteria information, and vagueness in the group decision-making process. To keep above nature of the decision-making problem, this paper use intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) based MCDM framework for sustainability assessment. The IF method is suitable for incorporating experts importance degree in decision-making problem. The proposed sustainability framework includes social, technical, economic, environmental, and political (STEEP) sustainability dimension for assessment of MFT location. The framework considers twenty-five sub-criteria, including four new criteria for location assessment. The importance of STEEP criterion is computed by employing IF-analytic hierarchy process (IF-AHP). The proposed framework is validated with a case of Eastern dedicated freight corridor (EDFC) of India. The sustainability assessment of four alternative locations is measured by employing an IF based TOPSIS method. The computation result of the considered case shows that technical sustainability is the most important criteria for location selection, followed by economic criteria. The experts' varying importance based sensitivity analysis is the novelty of this paper. The sensitivity analysis depicts the robustness of the proposed framework.

"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd This study examines the contours of electronic waste (“e-waste”) governance in Ghana, one of the top five importers of e-waste in the world, as well as the site of one of the most intensive e-waste scrapyards in the world, Agbogbloshie. At Agbogbloshie, despite the intentions of national Ghanaian regulations and hazardous waste laws, most e-waste is untreated or crudely processed via burning or acid baths. These practices release dioxins, furans, and heavy metals into the environment, invariably harming scrapyard workers, their families, and the greater urban community of Accra. However, the scrapyard also provides a critical source of livelihood for some of Ghana's most poor, vulnerable, and unskilled migrants. The aim and objective of this study is to humanize the conundrums and challenges that e-waste invokes in places such as Ghana. Based on extensive and original field research—including expert interviews, community interviews with scrapyard workers and families, and naturalistic observation at waste sites and other parts of the e-waste supply chain—this study asks: What benefits has e-waste brought communities in Ghana? What risks has it created? And, critically, what policies need implemented to make e-waste more sustainable? It documents ten ostensible benefits of e-waste alongside ten very real and growing risks. Then, it identifies a concert of fifteen different policy recommendations as well as four research gaps. It concludes by emphasizing the duality of the e-waste phenomenon and e-waste policy, and by underscoring the political economy dynamics of e-waste activities and practices.",Toxic transitions in the lifecycle externalities of a digital society: The complex afterlives of electronic waste in Ghana,Digital divide *** Digital society *** Electronic waste *** Informal economy *** Informal recycling *** Waste electrical and electronic equipment,resources policy,85070913310,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 by the authors. Over the last decade, the bioeconomy has become increasingly important and visible in international policy agendas, with several strategies being recently developed. The implementation of bio-based technologies mostly takes place on a regional scale. Therefore, from a regional perspective, a key question revolves around what main challenges are associated with technological developments that could catalyze the implementation of sustainable bioeconomy regions. In this study, a cross-cutting analysis was carried out to determine these challenges. First, interviews were conducted with industry practitioners and scientists working in the bioeconomy field. These interviews were supplemented with a literature review to determine the status quo of bioeconomy strategies and their implementation, particularly on a regional level. A multidisciplinary workshop was then organized to identify the most relevant challenges in the short-and mid-term associated with establishing bioeconomy regions. The results show that there is a three-pronged challenge in innovative technological development from a regional perspective: (1) Resources: The establishment of sustainable regional feedstock strategies and supplies for supporting the bio-industrial sector; (2) collaborators: The establishment of a regional ""critical mass"" by fostering supply chain clusters and networks; and (3) neighbors: Understanding the local dynamics of societal trends and preferences and social acceptance of bio-technologies and their representative bio-based products.","Resources, collaborators, and neighbors: The three-pronged challenge in the implementation of bioeconomy regions",Bioeconomy *** Innovation *** Life cycle thinking *** Regional bioeconomy *** Regional management *** Systems assessment *** Technological assessment *** Technological development,sustainability (switzerland),85078976453,2019,,,,,,

The majority of commercially oriented microfluidic technologies provide novel point-of-use solutions for laboratory automation with important areas in the context of the life sciences such as health care, biopharma, veterinary medicine and agrifood as well as for monitoring of the environment, infrastructures and industrial processes. Such systems are often composed of a modular setup exhibiting an instrument accommodating rather conventional actuation, detection and control units which interfaces with a fluidically integrated ""Lab-on-a-Chip"" device handling (bio-)sample(s) and reagents. As the complex network of tiny channels, chambers and surface-functionalised zones can typically not be properly cleaned and regenerated, these microfluidic chips are mostly devised as single-use disposables. The availability of cost-efficient materials and associated structuring, functionalisation and assembly schemes thus represents a key ingredient along the commercialisation pipeline and will be a first focus of this work. Furthermore, and owing to their innate variability, investigations on biosamples mostly require the acquisition of statistically relevant datasets. Consequently, intermediate numbers of consistently performing chips are already needed during application development; to mitigate the potential pitfalls of technology migration and to facilitate regulatory compliance of the end products, manufacture of such pilot series should widely follow larger-scale production schemes. To expedite and de-risk the development of commercially relevant microfluidic systems towards high Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), we illustrate a streamlined, manufacturing-centric platform approach employing the paradigms of tolerance-forgiving Design-for-Manufacture (DfM) and Readiness for Scale-up (RfS) from prototyping to intermediate pilot series and eventual mass fabrication. Learning from mature industries, we further propose pursuing a platform approach incorporating aspects of standardisation in terms of specification, design rules and testing methods for materials, components, interfaces, and operational procedures; this coherent strategy will foster the emergence of dedicated commercial supply chains and also improve the economic viability of Lab-on-a-Chip systems often targeting smaller niche markets by synergistically bundling technology development.",Efficient development of integrated lab-on-a-chip systems featuring operational robustness and manufacturability,Design-for-Manufacture *** Functional integration *** Lab-on-a-Chip *** Microfluidic platform *** Scale-up of manufacture *** Standardisation *** Technology readiness level *** Tolerance-forgiving design,micromachines,85079063157,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Container terminals are the typical representatives of complex supply chain logistics hubs with multiple compound attributes and multiple coupling constraints, and their operations are provided with the strong characteristics of dynamicity, nonlinearity, coupling, and complexity (DNCC). From the perspective of computational logistics, we propose the container terminal logistics generalized computing architecture (CTL-GCA) by the migration, integration, and fusion of the abstract hierarchy, design philosophy, execution mechanism, and automatic principles of computer organization, computing architecture, and operating system. The CTL-GCA is supposed to provide the problem-oriented exploration and exploitation elementary frameworks for the abstraction, automation, and analysis of green production at container terminals. The CTL-GCA is intended to construct, evaluate, and improve the solution to planning, scheduling, and decision at container terminals, which all are nondeterministic polynomial hard problems. Subsequently, the logistics generalized computational pattern recognition and performance evaluation of a practical container terminal service case study is launched by the qualitative and quantitative approach from the sustainable perspective of green production. The case study demonstrates the application, utilization, exploitation, and exploration of CTL-GCA preliminarily, and finds the unsustainable patterns of production at the container terminal. From the above, we can draw the following conclusions. For one thing, the CTL-GCA makes a definition of the abstract and automatic running architecture of logistics generalized computation for container terminals (LGC-CT), which provides an original framework for the design and implementation of control and decision mechanism and algorithm. For another, the CTL-GCA can help us to investigate the roots of DNCC thoroughly, and then the CTL-GCA makes for conducting the efficient and sustainable running pattern recognition of LGC-CT. It is supposed to provide a favorable guidance and supplement to define, design, and implement the agile, efficient, sustainable, and robust task scheduling and resource allocation for container terminals by computational logistics whether in the strategy level or the tactical one.",Container terminal logistics generalized computing architecture and green initiative computational pattern performance evaluation,Case study *** Computational logistics *** Computational pattern *** Container terminal *** Green initiative *** Logistics generalized computing architecture *** Performance evaluation,information (switzerland),85076468074,2019,,,,,,

The general objective of this study was to identify and prioritize the critical success factors required for the adoption of a system to create value for pharmaceutical supply chain stakeholders, and the pharmaceutical supply network as a whole, by using a multi-perspective framework that combines elements of the technology-organization-environment (TOE) contexts for enterprises. The methodology is based on a literature review and expert interviews following the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). This paper identifies and prioritizes 18 critical success factors from three categories: Technological, organizational, and environmental. From a practical point of view, this research contributes to the literature by providing expert insight on the topic of drug traceability, especially in terms of how possible values can be captured by companies.",Critical success factors of a drug traceability system for creating value in a pharmaceutical supply chain (PSC),Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) *** Critical success factors (CSFs) *** Drugs *** Pharmaceutical supply chain (PSC) *** Traceability *** Value creation,international journal of environmental research and public health,85067419605,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: Stakeholders such as customers, governments and environmental organisations are more concerned than ever about the impact of supply chain practices on the environment, leading firms to introduce environmental requirements into their supply contracts. While the extant literature on supply chains acknowledges this trend, it fails to inform comprehensively on the concept of “stringent environmental requirement” and its consequences. The purpose of this paper is to investigate this concept and explore how such requirements may translate into supplier environmental performance. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative methodology was adopted by the study and data were collected through conducting eight case studies in the Bangladesh ready-made garment (RMG) industry. Findings: A number of factors were found to be influencing suppliers’ perception of stringency, such as uncertainty relating to the newness and deadline of buyers’ environmental requirements, the complexity of implementing the requirements, and the use of buyer-specific frameworks. The research also shows that suppliers’ efforts in building environmental capability play a vital role in dealing with stringent environmental requirements. Research limitations/implications: The case studies are limited to the Bangladesh RMG industry. Given that environmental regulations vary across different countries and industries, the data may not reflect all the possible variations in stringent environmental requirements. Practical implications: The new insight proposed by this research can guide firms to further understand how supplier environmental performance and the sustainability of their supply chain can be achieved. The research provides broad insight into how suppliers can address stringent environmental requirements and improve their environmental performance. Originality/value: This research establishes evidence for the relatively new phenomenon of “stringent environmental requirements”, and develops a theoretical framework to demonstrate the relationships among the critical determinants relevant to this phenomenon.",How do suppliers address stringent environmental requirements from buyers?

"© 2019, University of Surrey. All rights reserved. In this paper, we use agent-based modeling (ABM) to study different obstacles to the expansion of contract rice farming in the context of Mekong Delta (MKD)‘s rice supply chain. ABM is a bottom-up approach for modeling the dynamics of interactionsamongindividuals and complex combinations of various factors (e.g., economic, social or environmental). Our agent-based contract farming model focuses on two critical components of contractual relationship, namely financial incentives and trust. We incorporate the actual recurrent fluctuations of spot market prices, which induce both contractor and farmer agents to renege on the agreement. The agent-based model is then used to predict emergent system-wide behaviors and compare counterfactual scenarios of different policies and initiatives on maintaining the contract rice farming scheme. Simulation results firstly show that a fully-equipped contractor who opportunistically exploits a relatively small proportion (less than 10%) of the contracted farmers in most instances can outperform spot market-based contractors in terms of average profit achieved for each crop. Secondly, a committed contractor who offers lower purchasing prices than the most typical rate can obtain better earnings per ton of rice as well as higher profit per crop. However, those contractors in both cases could not enlarge their contract farming scheme, since either farmers’ trust toward them decreases gradually or their offers are unable to compete with the benefits froma competitor or the spot market. Thirdly, the results are also in agreement with the existing literature that the contract farming scheme is not a cost-effective method for buyers with limited rice processing capacity, which is a common situation among the contractors in the MKD region. These results yield significant insights into the difficulty in expanding the agricultural contracting program in the MKD’s rice supply chain.",Contract farming in the Mekong Delta’s rice supply chain: Insights from an agent-based modeling study,Agent-based modeling *** Agricultural supply chain *** Computational simulation *** Contract farming,jasss,85071277943,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: In the era of Industry 4.0, knowledge component plays a vital role in manufacturing. For tacking the new complexities of the business, a concept of knowledge supply chain (KSC) is being proposed, which takes into account of knowledge component. Higher education institutes (HEIs) which are primary creator of knowledge are important foundations of such supply chain and act as the “knowledge supplier.” The purpose of this paper is to focus on why the HEIs are failed to become knowledge supplier in developing country like India. Design/methodology/approach: This research paper adopts a resource-based theory to explore the concept and identify barriers which obstructs the progress of HEIs to become prominent knowledge supplier to industry. To tackle the research problem, an integrated hybrid approach of interpretive structural modeling–analytic hierarchy process is used. Expert elicitation was engaged to find out the prominence of each barrier and the interrelations among them. Findings: Based on literature review, eight critical barriers were recognized. The findings put forward a four layer structural model. Based on this model, various remedial actions are also suggested to eliminate the barriers or lessen their negative effects on KSC. Practical implications: This study finds its practical implication in higher education reforms as the identified barriers could enhance the decision-making quality regarding academia–industry interaction. Social implications: Using the results of the study, HEIs could improve their social sustainability as they have different stakeholders covering wider sections of society and one being industry. Originality/value: Most of the existing studies talk about short-term interactions like technology transfer. This study takes into account the barriers which are acting as roadblocks in long-term knowledge supplying role of HEIs.",Academia a new knowledge supplier to the industry!

"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd Biogas production is one of the most promising pathways toward fully utilizing green energy within a circular economy. The anaerobic digestion process is the industry standard technology for biogas production due to its lowered energy consumption and its reliance on microbiology. Even in such an environmental-friendly process, liquid digestate is still produced from the remains of digested bio-feedstock and will require treatment. With unsuitable treatment procedure for liquid digestate, the mass of bio-feedstock can potentially escape the circular supply chain within the economy. This paper recommends the implementation of evaporator systems to provide a sustainable liquid digestate treating mechanism within the economy. Studied evaporator systems are represented by vacuum evaporation in combination with ammonia scrubber, stripping and reverse osmosis. Nevertheless, complex multi-dimensional decisions should be made by stakeholders before implementing such systems. Our work utilizes a novel techno-economics model to study the techno-economics robustness in implementing recent state-of-art vacuum evaporation systems with exploitation of waste heat from combined heat and power (CHP) units in biogas plants (BGP). To take into the account the stochasticity of the real world and robustness of the analysis, we used the Monte-Carlo simulation technique to generate more than 20,000 of different possibilities for the implementation of the evaporation system. Favourable decision pathways are then selected using a novel methodology which utilizes the artificial neural network and a hyper-optimized decision tree classifier. Two pathways that give the highest probability of providing a fast payback period are identified. Descriptive statistics are also used to analyse the distributions of decision parameters that lead to success in implementing the evaporator system. The results highlighted that integration of evaporation system are favourable when transport costs and incentives for CHP units are large and while feed-in tariffs for electricity production and specific investment costs are low. The result of this work is expected to pave the way for BGP stakeholders and decision makers in implementing liquid digestate treating technologies within the currently existing infrastructure.","Digestate evaporation treatment in biogas plants: A techno-economic assessment by Monte Carlo, neural networks and decision trees",Ammonium sulphate solution *** Anaerobic digestion *** Biogas plant *** Circular economy *** Energy consumption *** Liquid digestate *** Machine learning *** Nutrient recovery *** Vacuum evaporation,journal of cleaner production,85070258305,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: Although managers have struggled with SKU proliferation for decades, research has provided inconsistent guidance, and the cross-functional and cross-firm aspects of the problem were not considered. The purpose of this paper is to explore the factors that favor successful and sustainable SKU rationalization. Design/methodology/approach: A single case study was used to investigate the implementation of an SKU rationalization project by a national restaurant chain in collaboration with its food distributor. Qualitative data analysis techniques were used to understand managers’ perceptions about the SKU rationalization problem and the financial results that were achieved. Findings: The findings include seven propositions that begin to formalize theory for SKU rationalization. Cross-functional involvement was both a challenge and a critical success factor, and the supplier was an important resource for managing product variety and complexity. Research limitations/implications: Seven propositions are provided that increase the likelihood of successfully dealing with SKU proliferation. Practical implications: SKU proliferation increases supply chain complexity and leads to higher costs. The research reports on an SKU rationalization project that saved a company and its supplier $6.7m. Originality/value: A previously unexplored theoretical perspective on SKU rationalization was employed that emphasizes cross-functional alignment, buyer–supplier relationships and the impact on financial performance of a firm.","Stock keeping unit rationalization: a cross-functional, cross-firm perspective",Buyer–supplier relationships *** Case study *** North America *** Sourcing and supply *** Supply chain integration,international journal of logistics management,85074372151,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 American Chemical Society. Hydrogen and fuel cell technologies are one solution for addressing the challenges that major airports are facing today, such as upward price trends of liquid hydrocarbon fuels, greenhouse gas emission regulations, and stricter noise and air pollutant emission regulations, especially for on-ground pollution. An airport can also be viewed as the center of a hydrogen ecosystem, around which multiple hydrogen users could be clustered, with cost sharing of hydrogen production and storage occurring among users. The main novelty of the present work is the design of a hydrogen infrastructure irrigated by the airport ecosystem that satisfies the airport ecosystem energy needs. For this purpose, the model development is based on a multiobjective optimization framework designed to consider four echelons: energy sources, hydrogen production, transportation, and storage. The multiperiod problem is then solved using the ϵ-constraint method. Two objective functions are involved, that is, the total daily cost (TDC) of the network and an environmental indicator based on the global warming potential. The second innovative contribution is to model the demand uncertainty using fuzzy concepts for a hydrogen supply chain design. Because hydrogen demand is one the most significant parameters, the uncertainty of the demand has been considered using a proposed fuzzy linear programming strategy. The solutions are compared with the original crisp model, giving more robustness to the proposed approach. This work has been performed in the framework of the Hyport meta-project and, in particular, within the ""H2 modeling"" project. This paper focuses on a hydrogen airport ecosystem located in the department of Hautes-Pyrénées (France). However, the developed methodology could be extended to other hydrogen ecosystems for which deployment involves a multiperiod multi-objective formulation under an uncertain demand.",Optimal Design of a Sustainable Hydrogen Supply Chain Network: Application in an Airport Ecosystem,airport ecosystem *** demand under uncertainty *** hydrogen supply chain *** MILP *** optimization,acs sustainable chemistry and engineering,85074430452,2019,,,,,,

The water industry in every country aims to effectively and efficiently provide water with satisfactory quality in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner. To this end, it is critical to achieve effective communication among the partners in water supply chain networks. In this paper, we focus on one of the UK’s largest water utility companies and its eight main contractors and analyze the factors influencing partner and network communication in a managed programme of their asset supply chain. We employ social network analysis to conduct the cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of partner communication. Factors found to influence the communication network are grouping of projects within the programme, individual’s organisational affiliation, status, tenure, elapsed time through the programme lifecycle, and co-location. Our contributions to practice include demonstrating water programme management factors that influence communication and trust and how social network analysis can better inform them about intra-and interorganisational relationships. Moreover, the methodology introduced in this study may be applied to water management in other parts of the world.",Supply chain partner communication in a managed programme in the UK water industry: A case study with social network analysis,Programme management *** Social network analysis *** Water supply chain *** Water sustainability,international journal of environmental research and public health,85074370692,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd As computing power increases, more complex computational models are utilized for biomass supply system studies. The paper describes three commonly used modeling methods in this context, geographic information systems, life-cycle assessment, and discrete-time simulation and presents bibliometric analysis of work using these three study methods. Of the 498 publications identified in searches of the Scopus and Web of Science databases, 17 reported on combinations of methods: 10 on life-cycle assessment and geographic information systems, six on joint use of life-cycle assessment and discrete-time simulation, and one on use of geographic information systems jointly with discrete-time simulation. While no articles dealt directly with simultaneous use of all three methods, several acknowledged the potential of this. The authors discuss numerous challenges identified in the review that arise in combining methods, among them computational load, the increasing number of assumptions, guaranteeing coherence between the models used, and the large quantities of data required. Discussion of issues such as the complexity of reporting and the need for standard procedures and terms becomes more critical as repositories bring together research materials, including entire models, from various sources. Efforts to mitigate many of modeling's challenges have involved phase-specific modeling and use of such methods as expressions or uncertainty analysis in place of a complex secondary model. The authors conclude that combining modeling methods offer considerable potential for taking more variables into account; improving the results; and benefiting researchers, decision–makers, and operation managers by producing more reliable information.",Modeling of biomass supply system by combining computational methods – A review article,Agent-based modeling and simulation *** Biomass *** Discrete-event simulation *** Geographical information system *** Life cycle assessment *** Supply chain,applied energy,85063723292,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019, Global Institute of Flexible Systems Management. Healthcare supply chains (HSCs) have often been considered different from the usual supply chains (SCs) due to their high level of complexity, the presence of high-valuable medical materials and, finally, the fact that they deal with human lives. Furthermore, HSCs are not excluded from the increasing competitivity that is typical of the modern environment: International Healthcare systems are under increasing pressure to reduce waste and eliminate unnecessary costs while improving the quality and consistency of the care they provide to patient. The aim of this work is to analyse the impact of severe disruptions on SC performance in a Healthcare Supply Chain. More specifically, the objective of this study is to develop an approach to firstly analyse the effects of disruptions in terms of financial and operational performances, and successively to test different proactive and reactive mitigation strategies with the aim to maintain the highest service level, closed to 100%, in order to avoid shortages in hospitals’ wards. Disruptions can have a crucial impact on HSCs, because human lives can possibly be at the stake. Considering that the occurrence of disastrous events has been increasing in the last years, it is becoming inevitable to consider this risk in designing and planning HSCs that are more flexible and resilient. This work demonstrates that for long-lasting disruption, activating a backup supplier represents the most efficient mitigation strategy; on the other hand, for small-scale and short-duration disruptions, lateral transshipment represents a good way to mitigate the negative impacts of disruptions against a little increase in costs.",Healthcare Supply Chain Simulation with Disruption Considerations: A Case Study from Northern Italy,Case study *** Centralized distribution network *** Disruption *** Healthcare supply chain *** Mitigation strategy *** Simulation,global journal of flexible systems management,85075855053,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd Anthropocentrism and disciplinary research have not led to effective solutions to sustainability problems. A shift is required towards biocentric, transdisciplinarity-based solutions, to mitigate rebound effects and unintended, negative effects. In the field of Sustainable Supply Network Design, such shift implies on developing resilient solutions that maximize environmental benefits instead of minimizing environmental impacts. Recent researches have showed progress in this direction proposing more integrative approaches, but a framework to design supply networks with the purpose of environmental regeneration is yet to be proposed. This research aims to fill this gap, merging concepts from Regenerative Design, Transdisciplinary Research, Systems Thinking, Social Sciences and Design Sciences. Such framework is regarded as an artefact, and Design Science Research Methodology used for its development: a main problem is identified, objectives for a solution are drawn and the framework is designed. First, the Regenerative Supply Network Design is defined, to guide the elaboration of the Regenerative Supply Chain Design framework, consisting of six steps: (i) description of the network surroundings and identification of a regenerative purpose; (ii) redesign of outputs (iii) network conceptualization, (iv) optimize performance, (v) choose configuration, and (vi) implementation. Among the implications of this research are that (i) practitioners basing their design process in this framework are effectively shifting from anthropocentrism to biocentrism with a clear, defined purpose of environmental restoration and (ii), that the supply networks evolve in the integration with the environment, enhancing eco-systems resilience.",Towards Regenerative Supply Networks: A design framework proposal,Regenerative development *** Resilience *** Sustainable supply network design *** Systems approach *** Transdisciplinary research,journal of cleaner production,85062713681,2019,,,,,,

This paper places a critical spotlight on the ways in which governance and social responsibility concerning labour standards work in the context of public sector procurement. Supply chains provisioning the public sector, incorporating a vast array of materials used in public services such as education, health, social housing and transportation, have been under-researched and under-theorised in the geographical and wider social science literature on Global Production Networks, Global Value Chains and consumption ethics. Against this backdrop, the paper evaluates the emergence of ethical trading programmes involving labour standards in UK public sector sourcing, drawing on examples from the health, higher education, construction and transportation sectors and a methodology combining interviews with participant observation. Findings show that ethical public procurement is shaped, and often constrained, by: the relatively low profile of many materials used in public services, which challenge effective campaigning and advocacy work; the consequent limits to reputational risk for state departments and first-tier suppliers if labour issues are encountered in their supply chains; and the significant role of EU and UK procurement law, which until 2014 rendered social responsibility in public sector sourcing a legal risk to specify. Through a practice-orientated approach and adopting the notion of responsibilisation inspired by governmentality perspectives, the paper grasps how these challenges for ethical public procurement are encountered and negotiated by procurement managers and those influencing them in a neoliberal environment. It is shown that ethical sourcing is significantly less advanced in the UK public sector than it is in consumer goods sectors, with implications for social justice in a whole realm of under-researched global supply chains.",Public sector procurement and ethical trade: Governance and social responsibility in some hidden global supply chains,ethical trade *** global supply chains *** interviews *** labour standards *** public sector *** United Kingdom,transactions of the institute of british geographers,85054484738,2019,,,,,,

Fairtrade is changing. The hegemonic certified system, governed by Fairtrade International, has seen some high-profile withdrawals by major processors and retailers in recent months, which is leading to both proponents and critics questioning who, and what, the system is for. While the certified system has seen increasing conventionalisation, there remains at its core a mission to make trade fair, empower those marginalised in global trade and foster sustainable livelihoods. Taking a global production network (GPN) framework supports a critical exploration of the market, social and political asymmetries of this international system of production and distribution. Drawing on empirical evidence from the wine industry, this paper uses a production-space perspective to critically reflect on some of the key relations within Fairtrade GPNs. While there are many positive impacts, particularly in social development, producers have experienced a conventionalisation of supply chains, a lack of contextual responsiveness and limited engagement with the global system. These indicate a continuation of power asymmetries that are intersecting, multiscalar and evolving. Although these are from wine industry case studies, anecdotal evidence suggests that they are not uncommon experiences and even a hint of unfair, disempowering and unsustainable trading practices negatively impacts both these producers’ livelihoods and the reputation of the Fairtrade system as a whole. Nonetheless, there remains significant producer buy-in indicating that the ideals of Fairtrade retain currency. This therefore presents a critical opportunity for Fairtrade to actively address the market, social and political inequalities that persist in its GPNs and re-establish itself as a leader in the ethical marketplace.",Asymmetries and opportunities: Power and inequality in Fairtrade wine global production networks,Fairtrade *** global production networks *** power *** producers *** wine,area,85050505947,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 The management of the blood supply chain is considered of vital importance. The unavailability of blood may cause deaths and complications for patients.

"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd The current approaches to supply chain management generate large amounts of food waste due to the growing urbanization levels, increasing consumer demand for organic products and the growth of e-commerce distribution channel. These trends require the organizations to rethink their approaches to supply chain management, so that they could cope with the upcoming challenges. This research paper focuses on the ways a logistics cluster can provide the abilities to share information and thus improve the forecasting accuracy. The main novelty of the paper has been to work out a collaborative technological strategy which promotes information sharing in order to improve forecasting accuracy and inventory control for better alignment of demand and supply. The secondary contribution of the article is the determination of the influence of information sharing on forecasting accuracy in different market sizes, types and the consideration of consumer integration. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis has been completed to identify the optimal size of the logistics cluster the determination of which provides support when implementing the proposed strategy in practice. For the results validation we have implemented an agent-based model of the food supply chain. Our results have confirmed that information sharing increases the forecasting accuracy in multiple scenarios. Moreover, consumer integration is beneficial in a perfect competition market; however, its positive effect is less significant in an oligopoly market. These findings should be taken into consideration when developing e-commerce business strategy and forming logistics clusters. The usage of machine learning algorithms in the forecasting process provides adaptation capabilities for the supply chain members. The adaptation emerges as system resilience and it improves the alignment of demand and supply, reduces food waste levels and maintains higher nutrition value. The proposed strategy can ensure a long-term sustainable development to logistics cluster members.",Forecasting accuracy influence on logistics clusters activities: The case of the food industry,Agent-based modelling *** Collaborative forecasting *** Food industry *** Logistics cluster *** Sustainable development,journal of cleaner production,85071888656,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 Elsevier B.V. Civil society increasingly holds focal companies accountable for ensuring socially and environmentally sustainable production standards among their supply base. These standards entail increased levels of complexity to be addressed by appropriately designed tools, such as the Voting Analytic Hierarchy Process (VAHP) proposed by Liu and Hai (2005). This method of multi-criteria group decision making structures decision criteria in a hierarchical fashion as per Saaty's Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and employs data envelopment analysis (DEA) for deriving criteria weights from the ordinal preferences of the group members. Compared to AHP, the method permits a simpler application in a group decision context. However, its theoretical underpinnings have been questioned in the literature. This specifically concerns (i) the requirement of a strong convex order for the importance weights of ordinal rank gradations, and (ii) the choice of discrimination threshold for consecutive rank weights in the underlying DEA model. We propose a revised VAHP method that overcomes both issues (i) and (ii) by pursuing a game-theoretic approach to elicitation of criteria weights — so as to remove subjectivity from rank discrimination. We illustrate the application of the method on a real-world problem of sustainable supplier selection. We contribute to theory by proposing a more robust VAHP tool that helps supply chain and purchasing managers selecting suppliers based on a comprehensive set of criteria spanning all three sustainability dimensions (economic, environmental, and social), while coping with parsimonious input by group decision-makers.",The Voting Analytic Hierarchy Process revisited: A revised method with application to sustainable supplier selection,Game theory *** Group decisions *** Multi-criteria decision making *** Ordinal preferences *** Preference aggregation *** Supplier selection *** Sustainability,international journal of production economics,85061664920,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: Companies today observe an increase in the complexity and vulnerability of their supply chains (SCs) as a result of global scale networks and a turbulent environment. The purpose of this paper is to explore knowledge management (KM) as a potential way of reducing SC vulnerability and answer the following question: how does inter-organisational KM influence efforts to reduce SC vulnerability? Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the resource-based view and the knowledge-based view (KBV), a single case study in the energy industry is conducted by collecting various data through interviews, observations and internal documents. Findings: This edifying case study indicates that a lack of KM hinders any attempt to mitigate SC vulnerability.

"© 2019 American Chemical Society. Recently, finding sustainable solutions to deal with the environmental and social problems emerging from the combustion of fossil fuels in the transportation sector has attracted much interest. This paper proposes an integrated, multiperiod, mixed-integer, nonlinear programming model to design a biodiesel supply-chain network under uncertainty. To deal with the uncertainty of the parameters of the proposed model, a novel formulation of a possibilistic programming model based on possibilistic mean and absolute deviation of fuzzy numbers is proposed. The proposed model, called the possibilistic mean-absolute deviation model, utilizes not only the advantages of previous possibilistic programming methods, such as simultaneously handling the uncertainty and the flexibility in goals and constraints, but also balances mean and risk values of an objective function, including uncertain coefficients according to Decision-Maker's (DM) preferences. A real case study is conducted in Iran to evaluate the performance and efficiency of the proposed model. The proposed approach has better performance than a pure possibilistic programming model, and its results are justified by the robust possibilistic programming approaches.",Application of Fuzzy Optimization to Bioenergy-Supply-Chain Planning under Epistemic Uncertainty: A New Approach, ,industrial and engineering chemistry research,85064985567,2019,,,,,,
"© 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: Worldwide, facing increasing resources pressure, more and more manufacturing firms aim to circular economy (CE), which is a system characterized by the application of remanufacturing principles and adoption of sustainable manufacturing practices. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the function of remanufacturing capability in influencing supply chain resilience in supply chain networks under the moderating effects of both flexible orientation and control orientation. Design/methodology/approach: Data were gathered through a survey performed online in South Africa, and 150 participants completed the survey. Participants were mainly industry professionals holding senior administrative positions. Findings: Results indicate that market factors, management factors and technical factors positively influence dynamic remanufacturing capability (DRC). More specifically, on one hand, market factors strongly influence DRC, whereas, on the other hand, both management and technical factors influence at lower level DRC. DRC has a positive influence on supply chain resilience. Flexible orientation is found to positively moderate the effect of DRC on supply chain resilience, whereas control orientation does not exert any moderating effect on DRC and supply chain resilience. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies that explore research gaps between current vs desired remanufacturing capability requirements to achieve sustainability goals in CE.",Examining the role of dynamic remanufacturing capability on supply chain resilience in circular economy,Circular economy *** Remanufacturing capability *** Supply chain resilience *** Sustainability,management decision,85054597276,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 by the authors. Water supply facilities are vulnerable to extremeweather events, such as droughts and floods. To establish a sustainable solution that resists accidents and disasters, a distributed system is required. To supply high-quality tap water using the existing water-supply network, rechlorination facilities must be installed to secure residual chlorine at the pipe end. In this study, a process is developed to determine the injection points and dosages of rechlorination using the latest pressure-driven analysis. The method was compared to the results of demand driven analysis methods. The proposed model was applied to P City in Korea to draw results. A detailed evaluation was performed to study how water pressure head and demand-based hydraulic and water quality analysis results impact the injection points and dosages of rechlorination. Thus, the existing demand-based model shows significant spatial deviations in the pressure head in the presence of water pressure drops, which subsequently lead to over-estimation of chlorine injection dosages for maintaining the concentration of residual chlorine. However, the proposed model involves a numerically validated theory and draws more reasonable results for hydraulic, water quality, and rechlorination dosages. The proposed model can be used as a decision-making tool based on hydraulic analysis for the supply of water of a stable quality.",A comparative study on a hydraulic and water-quality analysis method for determining rechlorination injection points for a water-supply network,Hydraulic analysis *** Pressure-driven analysis *** Rechlorination facility *** Residual chlorine *** Water quality analysis *** Water supply network,water (switzerland),85065017562,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 American Institute of Mathematical Sciences. The design of agile supply chain networks has attracted more attention in recent years according to the competitive business environment. Further, due to high degree of uncertainty in agile supply chains (SCs), developing robust and efficient decision making tools are of interest. In this study, an integrated approach based on principal component analysis (PCA) and multiobjective possibilistic mixed integer programming (MOPMIP) approaches is proposed to optimally design agile supply chain network under uncertainty. The PCA method is used for ranking and filtering the suppliers, constituting the first layer of the supply chain, based on agility criteria. The proposed MOPMIP model is employed to construct the agile supply chain network under uncertainty. In the proposed MOPMIP model, three objective functions including 1) total costs minimization, 2) total delivery time minimization and 3) maximization of exibility are considered. An interactive fuzzy solution approach is used to solve the proposed MOPMILP model. Two numerical examples, is conducted to evaluate the performance and efficiency of the proposed integrated approach for agile supply chain network design under uncertainty.",An integrated principal component analysis and multi-objective mathematical programming approach to agile supply chain network design under uncertainty,Agile supply chain *** Fuzzy multi-objective programming *** Mathematical programming *** Principal component analysis *** Uncertainty,journal of industrial and management optimization,85063722185,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd Motivated by a real-life case study, this paper proposes a multilateral perspective for blood supply chain network design as an intricate decision-making problem. The proposed approach utilizes a novel multi-objective mathematical model by incorporating both quantitative and qualitative factors to comprehensively model the investigated case study. In the proposed model, the quantitative factors aim to minimize the loss of product freshness and total cost of the network. Moreover, the number of collection facilities, which are capable of collecting blood, are maximized through a formulation based upon qualitative criteria. Moreover, to cope with the uncertainty, a robust optimization approach is utilized, and an interactive fuzzy solution approach is applied to solve the proposed multi-objective model. The computational results demonstrate the capability of the proposed model in designing the blood supply chain network in practice. Moreover, some sensitivity analyses are conducted to show the findings observed in a real case study. The results show that the decision makers should be aware of quality-based requirements, because of significant impact on blood facility location, besides the cost-oriented consideration. Moreover, concerning of uncertainty, the results obtained from the robust approach outweigh those of the deterministic one. Finally, based on the finding, helpful managerial insights are provided for the decision makers in the blood supply chain network design.",A multilateral perspective towards blood network design in an uncertain environment: Methodology and implementation,Blood supply chain *** Multi-attribute group decision-making *** Multi-objective programming *** Robust optimization,computers and industrial engineering,85062438448,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 The Authors Agricultural systems in Europe face accumulating economic, ecological and societal challenges, raising concerns about their resilience to shocks and stresses. These resilience issues need to be addressed with a focus on the regional context in which farming systems operate because farms, farmers' organizations, service suppliers and supply chain actors are embedded in local environments and functions of agriculture. We define resilience of a farming system as its ability to ensure the provision of the system functions in the face of increasingly complex and accumulating economic, social, environmental and institutional shocks and stresses, through capacities of robustness, adaptability and transformability. We (i) develop a framework to assess the resilience of farming systems, and (ii) present a methodology to operationalize the framework with a view to Europe's diverse farming systems. The framework is designed to assess resilience to specific challenges (specified resilience) as well as a farming system's capacity to deal with the unknown, uncertainty and surprise (general resilience). The framework provides a heuristic to analyze system properties, challenges (shocks, long-term stresses), indicators to measure the performance of system functions, resilience capacities and resilience-enhancing attributes. Capacities and attributes refer to adaptive cycle processes of agricultural practices, farm demographics, governance and risk management. The novelty of the framework pertains to the focal scale of analysis, i.e. the farming system level, the consideration of accumulating challenges and various agricultural processes, and the consideration that farming systems provide multiple functions that can change over time. Furthermore, the distinction between three resilience capacities (robustness, adaptability, transformability) ensures that the framework goes beyond narrow definitions that limit resilience to robustness. The methodology deploys a mixed-methods approach: quantitative methods, such as statistics, econometrics and modelling, are used to identify underlying patterns, causal explanations and likely contributing factors; while qualitative methods, such as interviews, participatory approaches and stakeholder workshops, access experiential and contextual knowledge and provide more nuanced insights. More specifically, analysis along the framework explores multiple nested levels of farming systems (e.g. farm, farm household, supply chain, farming system) over a time horizon of 1–2 generations, thereby enabling reflection on potential temporal and scalar trade-offs across resilience attributes. The richness of the framework is illustrated for the arable farming system in Veenkoloniën, the Netherlands. The analysis reveals a relatively low capacity of this farming system to transform and farmers feeling distressed about transformation, while other members of their households have experienced many examples of transformation.",A framework to assess the resilience of farming systems,Enabling environment *** Farming systems *** Long-term stresses *** Private and public goods *** Resilience capacities *** Shocks,agricultural systems,85070191585,2019,,,,,,

In make-to-order (MTO)/engineer-to-order (ETO) business environments multiple customer-oriented projects compete for and share resources through interdependent engineering and production activities. Deep knowledge of critical dimensions that affect performance is key in this context. For this, we propose a set of determinants–workload, complexity, outsourcing, design reuse, project type, and knowledge/experience with technology, that impact performance. These determinants are input to an extended hybrid simulation model using system dynamics (SD), discrete event simulation (DES) and agent-based simulation (ABS) that tackles the needs imposed by activities of very different nature, as the project development and manufacturing/assembly operations. The hybrid model is applied to the case of an advanced manufacturing company. Through Monte Carlo sampling, the influence of different combinations of determinants in the performance variability is assessed. A correlation analysis shows evidence of association between all performance determinants and the project time and cost, while no evidence of association between the design reuse and project type determinants and the manufacturing and assembly time.",Assessing the impact of performance determinants in complex MTO/ETO supply chains through an extended hybrid modelling approach,correlation *** hybrid simulation *** Mote Carlo *** MTO/ETO supply chain,international journal of production research,85057327666,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019, Springer Nature B.V. During recent years, the importance of preparedness has increased with increasing frequency of disasters and the cost associated with relief and response activities. Therefore, this study is designed to present the identification and evaluation process of cyclone disaster’s preparedness activities also termed as measures. In this study, 27 cyclone preparedness activities have been prioritized considering six criteria—effective and immediate response, last mile connectivity, disaster resilient community, risk and vulnerability reduction, life safety and property protection, and sustainable recovery and rehabilitation. Moreover, the evaluation process for prioritization of preparedness activities involves significant uncertainty and subjectivity. Therefore, this study integrates the fuzzy logic with analytical network process, a multi-criteria decision-making tool to analyze and present the ranking of selected preparedness activities. Results of this research indicate that human resource management activities are the most needed preparedness activities to mitigate the risk of cyclone disasters in the Indian context.

"© 2019 Off-site construction is a rising topic in both academic research and industrial applications because of its potential to bring about high-level of industrialization, environmental benefits, and sustainability in the built environment. Precast supply chain, as a vital connection between construction sites and off-site plants, is the focus of many recent studies. While these studies have greatly advanced precast supply chain management (PSCM), a critical analysis to summarize the recent research, to identify research gaps, and to inform future research needs is largely missing in the field of precast supply chain management. The overarching goal of this paper is to create a taxonomy to properly classify existing studies in precast supply chain management so as to reveal research gaps and suggest future research opportunities. The specific tasks in this review project include: (1) conducting bibliographic categorizations with regard to journals, years and geographic distributions of publications; (2) identifying the citation correlations and formulating the keyword connection networks; (3) classifying the literature based on research topics and highlighting the state of the art pertaining to each subtopic. The in-depth analysis shows that the studies on precast production are dominant in the PSCM domain. The major research approaches used in existing studies include the genetic algorithm, simulation, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), and BIM (Building Information Modeling). At last, the possible future research focuses are highlighted, such as dynamic disturbances management, smart precast supply chain, coordination among participants, simultaneously optimizing scheduling and resource allocation.",Precast supply chain management in off-site construction: A critical literature review,Delivery *** Inventory *** Precast construction *** Production *** Research gaps *** Supply chain,journal of cleaner production,85067061623,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature. To carry out a comprehensive analysis of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies, two major aspects need to be considered. Firstly, identification of AM’s capabilities in manufacturing final products in industry requires an accurate evaluation of their impacts across all supply chain stages. Secondly, making products additively entails potential consequences for different product lifecycle phases, e.g., design, preparation, production, usage, etc. that need to be managed accordingly. The current study tries to jointly address these two aspects by focusing on an extensive review of qualitative and quantitative cases taken from literature, as well as empirical observations made in industry. The study shows that impacts of AM technologies are not partial or isolated disruptions, but rather encompass a range of changes whose overall consequences spread across different phases of supply chain. Another result of the study is that a benchmarking of AM and conventional technologies on their overall performance is exhaustive only when all features of productions and logistics networks are evaluated simultaneously, rather than in their isolated states.",Supply chain implications of additive manufacturing: a holistic synopsis through a collection of case studies,Additive manufacturing *** Qualitative analysis *** Quantitative cases *** Supply chain,international journal of advanced manufacturing technology,85061665508,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd The growing environmental problems, the rapid urbanization, and the disappearance of the demographic dividend in China has brought unprecedented opportunities to the development of prefabricated housing (PH). However, many barriers are hindering the promotion of PH, for instance, cost, lack of regulations, and the shortage of knowledge, among which cost is identified as one of the most critical barriers. Unlike previous studies focused only on production costs, this research aims to investigate transaction costs (TCs), e.g., searching costs, negotiation costs, and enforcement costs. First, this paper develops a theoretical TCs framework of the PH supply chain, based on an extensive literature review. Secondly, an empirical study was conducted on two cases in Chongqing to validate the TCs framework. Key stakeholders are identified by Social Network Analysis (SNA). Subsequently, 25 semi-structured interviews were conducted with key stakeholders, both to verify the new TCs framework and to explore stakeholder concerns about TCs. The centrality metrics by SNA identified six key stakeholders who have a significant influence on TCs. It is found from the interviews that both the conceptual phase and the construction phase are stages where the majority of TCs occur. Both the developer and the general contractor are paying for more TCs compared to the other stakeholders. This study contributes to theory by initially introducing the concepts of TCs to the PH field, and the findings bring implications on the governance of PH supply chain to both private stakeholders and the government.",Exploring transaction costs in the prefabricated housing supply chain in China,Construction supply chain *** Prefabricated housing *** Social network analysis *** Stakeholders *** Sustainability *** Transaction costs,journal of cleaner production,85064838632,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd In the current study, a green closed-loop supply chain network design for perishable products is investigated under uncertain conditions. The demands, rate of return and the quality of returned products stand as an uncertain parameter. The considered chain, based on the study of a dairy company, is a multi-period and multi-product that comprises suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses, retailers and collection centers. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is projected to minimize the cost and environmental pollutant, simultaneously. Besides, an innovative MILP robust model is developed for the problem under uncertainty. Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, the research has developed an efficient heuristic, named YAG, to solve large-sized problems. Computational experiments conducted indicating that the YAG method has an average gap of less than 1.65 percent from the optimal solution within a reasonable time. Also, the YAG method finds the optimal solution in more than 34 percent of instances. The performance of the robust approach and the heuristic method is examined in a real case study and a diverse range of problems. The results revealed that the robust model compared to the deterministic model has better quality and seem quite more reliable. The effect of the product's lifetime, bi-objective modeling and environmental pollutant are considered throughout the study. The results indicate that the effects of products’ lifetime and level of uncertainty vary for cost and environmental pollution objectives.",Heuristic method for robust optimization model for green closed-loop supply chain network design of perishable goods,Green closed-loop supply chain *** Heuristic algorithm *** Perishable goods *** Robust optimization,journal of cleaner production,85064463486,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 by the authors. The world's oceans face unprecedented anthropogenic threats in the globalized era that originate from all over the world, including climate change, global trade and transportation, and pollution. Marine protected areas (MPAs) serve important roles in conservation of marine biodiversity and ecosystem resilience, but their success is increasingly challenged in the face of such large-scale threats. Here, we illustrate the utility of adopting the interdisciplinary telecoupling framework to better understand effects that originate from distant places and cross MPA boundaries (e.g., polluted water circulation, anthropogenic noise transport, human and animal migration). We review evidence of distal processes affecting MPAs and the cutting-edge approaches currently used to investigate these processes. We then introduce the umbrella framework of telecoupling and explain how it can help address knowledge gaps that exist due to limitations of past approaches that are centered within individual disciplines. We then synthesize five examples from the recent telecoupling literature to explore how the telecoupling framework can be used for MPA research. These examples include the spatial subsidies approach, adapted social network analysis, telecoupled qualitative analysis, telecoupled supply chain analysis, and decision support tools for telecoupling. Our work highlights the potential for the telecoupling framework to better understand and address the mounting and interconnected socioeconomic and environmental sustainability challenges faced by the growing number of MPAs around the world.",A synthesis of opportunities for applying the telecoupling framework to marine protected areas,Climate change *** Marine protected area *** Spillover *** Telecoupling,sustainability (switzerland),85071011164,2019,,,,,,

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify and model the evaluation criteria for the selection of third-party logistics service provider (3PLSP) by an interpretive structural modelling (ISM) approach in the pharmaceutical sector. Design/methodology/approach: Delphi technique was used for identifying the most significant criteria, and the ISM method was employed for developing the interrelationship among the criteria. Also, the critical criteria for having high influential power were identified by using the Matrice d’Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliqués à un Classement analysis. Findings: The most significant factors, namely, capability of robust supply network/distribution network, quality certification and health safety, service quality and environmental quality certifications, were found to have a high driving power, and these factors demand the maximum attention of the decision makers. Research limitations/implications: As the ISM approach is a qualitative tool, the expert opinions were used for developing the structural model, and the judgments of the experts could be biased influencing the reliability of the model. The developed hierarchical concept is proposed to help the executives, decision and policy makers in formulating the strategies and the evaluation of sustainable 3PLSP.

"© 2019 by the authors. An exemplary paradigm of how an AI can be a disruptive technological paragon via the utilization of blockchain comes straight from the world of deep learning. Data scientists have long struggled to maintain the quality of a dataset for machine learning by an AI entity. Datasets can be very expensive to purchase, as, depending on both the proper selection of the elements and the homogeneity of the data contained within, constructing and maintaining the integrity of a dataset is difficult. Blockchain as a highly secure storage medium presents a technological quantum leap in maintaining data integrity. Furthermore, blockchain's immutability constructs a fruitful environment for creating high quality, permanent and growing datasets for deep learning. The combination of AI and blockchain could impact fields like Internet of things (IoT), identity, financial markets, civil governance, smart cities, small communities, supply chains, personalized medicine and other fields, and thereby deliver benefits to many people.",Artificial intelligence implementations on the blockchain.

"© 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate effects on global supply chain reconfigured in the customs duty rate of parts and specific material types brought about by Brexit and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Design/methodology/approach: The supply chain network is modeled and formulated using mixed integer programming. Numerical experiments are conducted using bill of materials with information such as the procurement cost of each part, 3D-CAD and an industry census. Findings: The experiments indicates that if the customs duty rate increases by Brexit, manufacturers would be necessary to restructure supply chain configuration and locate the domestic factory and market. Additionally, when the UK leaves the EU and joins the TPP, there is a case where the total cost decreases in the global supply chain network compared to the baseline without Brexit. Therefore, it is reasonable for the UK to join the TPP. Practical implications: The study shows how new trading rules from non-partnership countries can critically disrupt existing global supply chain equilibrium. Asian manufacturers should evaluate a move to more local sourcing, opening new facilities and setting up warehouses to stock finished goods or raw materials in different trading areas to overcome any barriers to the goods movement. Originality/value: This study enables us to quantitatively evaluate what there are opportunities or cost increasing risks by the selection of supply chain configuration for Asian manufacturers by political and economic factors of each country, such as Brexit and participation in TPP.",The impact of Brexit on designing a material-based global supply chain network for Asian manufacturers,Bill of materials *** Economic partnership agreement *** Free trade agreement *** Future production *** Material imported tax *** Sustainable supply chain,management of environmental quality: an international journal,85063942891,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature. Purpose of Review: Differentiated service delivery (DSD) models were initially developed as a means to combat suboptimal long-term retention in HIV care, and to better titrate limited health systems resources to patient needs, primarily in low-income countries. The models themselves are designed to streamline care along the HIV care cascade and range from individual to group-based care and facility to community-based health delivery systems. However, much remains to be understood about how well and for whom DSD models work and whether these models can be scaled, are sustainable, and can reach vulnerable and high-risk populations. Implementation science is tasked with addressing some of these questions through systematic, scientific inquiry. We review the available published evidence on the implementation of DSD and suggest further health systems innovations needed to maximize the public health impact of DSD and future implementation science research directions in this expanding field. Recent Findings: While early observational data supported the effectiveness of various DSD models, more recently published trials as well as evaluations of national scale-up provide more rigorous evidence for effectiveness and performance at scale. Deeper understanding of the mechanism of effect of various DSD models and generalizability of studies to other countries or contexts remains somewhat limited. Relative implementability of DSD models may differ based on patient preference, logistical complexity of model adoption and maintenance, human resource and pharmacy supply chain needs, and comparative cost-effectiveness. However, few studies to date have evaluated comparative implementation or cost-effectiveness from a health systems perspective. Summary: While DSD represents an exciting and promising “next step” in HIV health care delivery, this innovation comes with its own set of implementation challenges. Evidence on the effectiveness of DSD generally supports the use of most DSD models, although it is still unclear which models are most relevant in diverse settings and populations and which are the most cost-effective. Challenges during scale-up highlight the need for accurate differentiation of patients, sustainable inclusion of a new cadre of health care worker (the community health care worker), and substantial strengthening of existing pharmacy supply chains. To maximize the public health impact of DSD, systems need to be patient-centered and adaptive, as well as employ robust quality improvement processes.","A Review of Differentiated Service Delivery for HIV Treatment: Effectiveness, Mechanisms, Targeting, and Scale",Differentiated service delivery *** HIV *** Implementation science *** Patient-centered care *** Sub-Saharan Africa,current hiv/aids reports,85068118778,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd Disruption in the electric power system network can have dramatic effects on supply chain performance in terms of economic and environmental objectives, especially for perishable products. This paper addresses the design of a resilient green-closed loop supply chain network for perishable products under the risk of electric power network disruption. The research has presented an integrated model for the interdependent two-layer network structure as a strategy to mitigate the power disruption risk in order to minimize the expected total network cost and the expected total amount of carbon emissions. Integration of two networks on both objectives along with the effect of products’ lifetime has been analyzed in a real case study of the dairy industry. The results designate that the integration of the two networks leads to improvements in both objective functions. The average total network cost and total carbon emissions have been reduced by 21% and 25% compared to the non-integrated layers, respectively. Furthermore, by increasing the products lifetime, the projected model enjoys higher performance being compared with the non-integrated layers model. This paper concludes that the integrated decision making about the infrastructure networks e.g. power network with the supply chain enjoys economic and environmental benefits for both networks layers under power network disruptions.",An integrated two-layer network model for designing a resilient green-closed loop supply chain of perishable products under disruption,Disruption *** Interdependent two-layer *** Location-inventory *** Perishable products *** Resilient green-closed-loop supply chain,journal of cleaner production,85066026280,2019,,,,,,

Frequent occurrences of risks lead to too many disruptions and thus affect the sustainability of perishable products supply chains. This paper explores the risk propagation mechanisms and puts forward the feasible countermeasures for perishable products supply chains to improve the sustainability, which are tested by use of the case study of the yogurt supply chain in Company L. First, using the Tropos Goal-Risk framework, a perishable products supply chain is modeled, and the risk propagation chain is extracted. Then, the three-dimension model of supply chain risk propagation is proposed to represent the risk propagation mechanisms on the basis of the risk propagation chain, according to which, the complexities of the risk propagation in a perishable products supply chain is analyzed. Finally, the risk management strategies are proposed based on the three-dimension model and by dealing with the complexities. This paper innovatively explores how to improve the sustainable operations of perishable products supply chains from the perspective of risk propagation based on Tropos Goal-Risk framework, which creatively replenishes the risk propagation theory and risk management strategies of perishable products supply chains, as well as provides the technical and methodological supports for the study on the risk propagation mechanisms and countermeasures to improve the sustainability of perishable products supply chains.",Risk propagation mechanisms and risk management strategies for a sustainable perishable products supply chain,Complexity *** Fractal *** Perishable products *** Risk management strategy *** Risk propagation *** Supply chain,computers and industrial engineering,85060093901,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited. Social and economic networks can be a channel of negative shocks and thus deteriorate resilience and sustainability in societies. This study focuses on supply chains, or supplier–customer networks of firms and examines how these supply chains enable production losses caused by natural disasters to propagate and persist in regions not directly affected by the disaster. We apply an agent-based model to the actual supply chains of nearly one million firms in Japan to estimate the direct and indirect effects of the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake. We then employ the same model to predict the effect of the Nankai Trough earthquake, a mega earthquake predicted to hit major industrial cities in Japan in the near future. We find that the indirect effects of the disasters on production due to propagation (10.6% of gross domestic product in the case of the Nankai earthquake) are substantially larger than their direct effects (0.5%). Our simulation analyses to compare the actual network with hypothetical networks suggest that these indirect effects are more prominent and persistent when supply chains are characterized by scale-free properties, difficulty in substitution among intermediate products, and complex cycles in networks.",Firm-level propagation of shocks through supply-chain networks, ,nature sustainability,85070817361,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd The complexity involved in demand forecast for supply chain management of electronics components is exponentially increasing owing to demand fluctuations in consumer electronics, shortening of product life cycles, continuous technology migration, lengthy production cycle time, and long lead time for capacity expansion. While global manufacturing networks often suffer the risks of oversupply and shortage of key components, the distributor that is the key intermediate participator in electronics product supply chain buys components from the suppliers, warehouses them, and resells different parts to a number of electronics manufacturers with vendor-managed inventories. Thus, the component distributors forecast the demands for large assortments of stock keeping units (SKUs) with distinct dynamics for inventory control and supply chain management. To address realistic needs to enhance demand forecast performance, this study aims to develop a UNISON data-driven analytics framework that integrates machine learning technologies and temporal aggregation mechanism to forecast the demands of intermittent electronics components. An empirical study is conducted in a world-leading semiconductor distributor for validation.

"© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature. This paper aims to develop a recovery planning approach in a three-tier manufacturing supply chain, which has a single supplier, manufacturer, and retailer under an imperfect production environment, in which we consider three types of sudden disturbances: demand fluctuation, and disruptions to production and raw material supply, which are not known in advance. Firstly, a mathematical model is developed for generating an ideal plan under imperfect production for a finite planning horizon while maximizing total profit, and then we re-formulate the model to generate the recovery plan after happening of each sudden disturbance. Considering the high commercial cost and computational intensity and complexity of this problem, we propose an efficient heuristic, to obtain a recovery plan, for each disturbance type, for a finite future period, after the occurrence of a disturbance. The heuristic solutions are compared with a standard solution technique for a considerable number of random test instances, which demonstrates the trustworthy performance of the developed heuristics. We also develop another heuristic for managing the combined effects of multiple sudden disturbances in a period. Finally, a simulation approach is proposed to investigate the effects of different types of disturbance events generated randomly. We present several numerical examples and random experiments to explicate the benefits of our developed approaches. Results reveal that in the event of sudden disturbances, the proposed mathematical and heuristic approaches are capable of generating recovery plans accurately and consistently.",A mathematical modelling approach for managing sudden disturbances in a three-tier manufacturing supply chain,Demand fluctuation *** Heuristic *** Quantitative recovery plan *** Sudden disturbance *** Supply chain disruption,annals of operations research,85065544928,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd Sectors tend to generate pressure on the environment due to its large amounts of emissions. The aim of this study is to identify critical betweenness sectors and transactions that play an important intermediate role in the supply chain, which can provide additional insights for CO2 emissions. Based on the input-output and energy consumption data in China, the notion of network centrality and structural path analysis method are employed in this paper to identify critical betweenness sectors and transactions, and then the evolutionary trends of betweenness sectors and transactions are analyzed from 2005 to 2015. The results show that some critical betweenness sectors, such as Metal products sector and Electrical equipment sector, have huge potential for carbon emission reduction, which fail to receive sufficient attention from the perspective of production or consumption. Some critical transactions, such as the transaction from Nonmetal products sector to Construction sector, have a large amount of CO2 emissions.

"© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd. The last few years have seen a great number of announcements and projections on cities of the future, where technological interconnected metering infrastructure is the main smart-grid unit, promoting higher sustainability due to its more efficient management capability. The water supply network is one of the grids that has been given additional attention due to the problem of waste caused by water leakage, usually requiring rapid detection for fast intervention to prevent high costs. With centralised information coming from the grid, like the measurement of pressure and flow, it is revealed that anomaly detection could be an important tool for quick automatic detection without needing permanent analysis by a human operator. However, there is a need for a more robust approach, especially when noisy data are present. In this paper, we propose the implementation of a new approach based on a hybrid expectation maximization (EM) Gaussian model combined with a t-distribution mixture. This approach is compared to both a pure EM Gaussian mixture model and a t-distribution mixture model that can use labelled data or not. Each EM algorithm was applied to real data acquired from a water supply grid with the aim of automatically detecting water leaks. Using the newly developed approach, the results show that detection is both possible and more accurate for this type of database.",Semi-supervised Gaussian and t-distribution hybrid mixture model for water leak detection,clustering *** distribution functions *** expectation maximization *** remote sensing *** semi-supervised *** water leak detection,measurement science and technology,85075668046,2019,,,,,,
"© 2018 IEEE. Economic globalization is increasing connectedness among regions of the world, creating complex interdependencies within various supply chains. Recent studies have indicated that changes and disruptions within such networks can serve as indicators for increased risks of violence and armed conflicts. This is especially true of countries that may not be able to compete for scarce commodities during supply shocks. Thus, network-induced vulnerability to supply disruption is typically exported from wealthier populations to disadvantaged populations. As such, researchers and stakeholders concerned with supply chains, political science, environmental studies, etc. need tools to explore the complex dynamics within global trade networks and how the structure of these networks relates to regional instability. However, the multivariate, spatiotemporal nature of the network structure creates a bottleneck in the extraction and analysis of correlations and anomalies for exploratory data analysis and hypothesis generation. Working closely with experts in political science and sustainability, we have developed a highly coordinated, multi-view framework that utilizes anomaly detection, network analytics, and spatiotemporal visualization methods for exploring the relationship between global trade networks and regional instability. Requirements for analysis and initial research questions to be investigated are elicited from domain experts, and a variety of visual encoding techniques for rapid assessment of analysis and correlations between trade goods, network patterns, and time series signatures are explored. We demonstrate the application of our framework through case studies focusing on armed conflicts in Africa, regional instability measures, and their relationship to international global trade.",A visual analytics framework for spatiotemporal trade network analysis,Anomaly detection *** Global trade network *** Visual analytics,ieee transactions on visualization and computer graphics,85051811062,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd The solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies offer a sustainable solution to energy-poor communities. Adoption and sustained use of solar PV merit participation of local communities in planning and implementation. The literature on off-grid solar PV interventions that do not take the approach of involving communities point towards the difficulties experienced in reaching the bottom of the pyramid (BoP) communities as wells as in supply chain and after-sales service. Similarly, there is a gap in scientific literature that explores community inclusive initiatives to foster sustained uptake of solar PV technologies. Our study fills this gap, and discusses: 1) pathways to engage with rural poor communities to promote solar off-grid access, and 2) the impact of engaging with these communities particularly women, on their energy security and livelihood opportunities. We study a two-phased intervention in rural poor setting in Dungarpur district of Rajasthan state in India. The intervention can be broadly classified into two phases: (i) the distribution of solar study lamps to rural school students and mothers, wherein the lamps were assembled and maintained by the local community (self-help group networks), (ii) the entrepreneurship development of local community members towards continued livelihood through solar. We adopted mixed methods approach to collect and analyze the quantitative data from beneficiary households, while qualitative data were collected from SHG members. Our findings demonstrate the utility of localized intervention and the significance and challenges of engaging local communities. The consumers used these solar lamps for multiple activities and prefer solar over grid electricity for basic lighting. The voltage fluctuations or poor quality of electricity supply influences the preference to solar over the conventional grid. Local services enabled continued functioning of lamps, thereby increasing consumer confidence. The intervention built capacity of and created continued livelihood opportunities for local women in these communities, resulting in their economic and social growth. Appropriate capacity building and support to the SHG federations can channelize clean energy interventions at required speed, quality, and coverage. In the context of energy poor BoP communities of the Global South, our research provides key determinants impacting development of community-centered renewable energy interventions, crucial for the realization of Sustainable Development Goal 7.",Does involvement of local community ensure sustained energy access?

"Copyright: © 2019 INFORMS We introduce a new class of adaptive policies called periodic-affine policies, which allows a decision maker to optimally manage and control large-scale newsvendor networks in the presence of uncertain demand without distributional assumptions. These policies are data-driven and model many features of the demand such as correlation and remain robust to parameter misspecification. We present a model that can be generalized to multiproduct settings and extended to multiperiod problems. This is accomplished by modeling the uncertain demand via sets. In this way, it offers a natural framework to study competing policies such as base-stock, affine, and approximative approaches with respect to their profit, sensitivity to parameters and assumptions, and computational scalability. We show that the periodic-affine policies are sustainable—that is, time consistent—because they warrant optimality both within subperiods and over the entire planning horizon. This approach is tractable and free of distributional assumptions, and, hence, suited for real-world applications. We provide efficient algorithms to obtain the optimal periodic-affine policies and demonstrate their advantages on the sales data from one of India’s largest pharmacy retailers.",Sustainable inventory with robust periodic-affine policies and application to medical supply chains,Affine policies *** Correlation *** Demand uncertainty *** Healthcare: pharmacy retailer *** Newsvendor network *** Robust optimization,management science,85075388178,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd Efficient tracking of shipments is critical in managing global trade and logistics activities. The volume of global container movement combined with information opaqueness and process complexity necessitates implementing a robust technology solution with real time tracking capabilities. Blockchain is an emerging technology that offers the necessary platform to track and manage shipment movements in the supply chain using a peer-to-peer, secured, distributed ledger, and without intermediaries or trusted third parties. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution for efficient supply chain management involving items shipped via smart containers. Our proposed solution utilizes the features of smart contracts in Ethereum blockchain to govern and manage interactions between the sender and receiver. Shipped items are included in smart containers equipped with Internet of Things (IoT) sensors that can be used to track and monitor predefined shipping conditions related to temperature, geographical location, humidity, pressure, light exposure, sudden fall, broken seal, etc. Ethereum smart contracts are used to manage shipment conditions, automate payments, legitimize receiver and also issue a refund in case of violations to predefined conditions. In the paper, we present and discuss key aspects related to architectural design, entity relations, interactions among participants, information flow, implementation and testing of the overall system functionality with a potential business case applied to vaccine supply chain.

"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd In the new global economy, intensive production models based on high-yield varieties of wheat have become a central issue for the fight against hunger, undernourishment, and poverty. Nonetheless, this intensive model - and the related globalized processing and marketing system – poses a challenge to the conservation of biodiversity and to environmental sustainability. In addition, volatility on world cereal markets is threatening farmers' income, triggering diversification patterns. One of this pattern is the creation of alternative food chains intended as supply chains that are territorially embedded and able to reconnect producers with consumers. In this context, this paper aims to explore the diversity of alternative bread chains and valorisation practices, in order to identify organizational models, assess their economic performance in terms of creating added value distributing it along the stages of the chain and to understand the role played by ancient wheat varieties in differentiating the product. In order to do this, the paper develops a comparative case study analysis of several locally-based alternative bread supply chains in Tuscany (Italy). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key actors, selected considering all the steps in the supply chain: from growing the wheat and milling the grain through to the end product. From these interviews differences emerged between locally-based bread supply chains in terms of the valorisation system followed and the institutional arrangements. While the locally-based chains featuring modern wheat varieties have more conventional characteristics and pursue differentiation strategies based on certification, chains based on ancient wheat follow a more informal route, and product quality is mainly guaranteed by the reputation of the network. Furthermore, in the bread supply chains featuring ancient varieties, the methods for reducing transaction costs are linked to a bottom-up collective action, embeddedness strategies among stakeholders (that include also consumers), and are built on a relational approach based on trust, knowledge exchange and social networks. Results provide an assessment of the performances of different locally-based bread supply chains, identify critical aspects and suggest some policy implications for all types of chains.",The valorisation of wheat production through locally-based bread chains: Experiences from Tuscany,Alternative bread supply chains *** Ancient wheat varieties *** Biodiversity conservation *** Governance models *** Low-input farming,journal of rural studies,85072274069,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd The United Nations define Supply Chain Sustainability as “the management of environmental, social and economic impacts, and the encouragement of good governance practices throughout the lifecycles of goods and services.” (UN, 2015). We deal with the logistic network, an important component of the Supply Chain, in industries either generating or using hazardous material (HM) in some stage of their productive processes. A major concern when transporting HM or locating hazardous facilities is to minimize risks and hazards to the population and environment. Most studies on this issue only consider one type of HM and fail to differentiate populations with different degrees of vulnerability. This work addresses both the problem of locating hazardous facilities and routing HMs across a large, densely populated urban area, minimizing the associated costs and hazards imposed on the population. Populations, aggregated in centers, were differentiated into vulnerable populations, which are the hardest to evacuate in a short period of time, and non-vulnerable populations. Several types of HMs with different degrees of hazard were considered. We propose a multi-objective programming model with multiple origin-destination (OD) pairs that considers maximizing the minimum weighted distance between hazardous facilities and the exposed vulnerable population, maximizing the minimum weighted distance from HM transportation arcs to the exposed vulnerable population, minimizing the total hazard imposed on the non-vulnerable population, and routing and location costs. The methodology has been tested in the transportation network in the city of Santiago, Chile.",A multi-product maximin hazmat routing-location problem with multiple origin-destination pairs,Hazmat *** Location-routing problem *** Multi-product *** Urban networks,journal of cleaner production,85071881353,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 by the authors. Supply chain network design (SCND) is an important strategic decision determining the structure of each entity in the supply chain, which has an important impact on the long-term development of a company. An efficient and effective supply chain network is of vital importance for improving customer satisfaction, optimizing the allocation of resources, and increasing profitability. The environmental concerns and social responsibility awareness of the whole society have spurred researchers and managers to design sustainable supply chains (SSCs) integrating the economic, environmental, and social factors. In addition, the innate uncertainty of the SCND problem requires an integrated method to cope. In this regard, this study develops a multi-echelon multi-objective robust fuzzy closed-loop supply chain network (CLSCN) design model under uncertainty including all three dimensions of sustainability. This model considers the total cost minimization, carbon caps, and social impact maximization concurrently to realize supply chain sustainability, and is able to make a balance between the conflicting multiple objectives. Meanwhile, the uncertainty of the parameters is divided into two categories and addressed with two approaches: the first category is missed working days related to social impact, which is solved by the fuzzy membership theory; the second category is the demand and remanufacturing rate, which is settled by a robust optimization method. To validate the ability and applicability of the model and solution approach, a numerical example is conducted and solved using ILOG CPLEX. The result shows that the supply chain network structure and the value of the optimization objectives will change when considering sustainability and different degrees of uncertainty. This will enable supply chain managers to reduce the environmental impact and enhance the social benefits of their supply chain activities, and design a more stable supply chain to better cope with the influence of uncertainty.",A robust fuzzy optimization model for closed-loop supply chain networks considering sustainability,Closed-loop supply chain *** Fuzzy membership degree *** Network design *** Robust optimization *** Sustainability,sustainability (switzerland),85074000749,2019,,,,,,
"© 1973-2011 IEEE. Service supply chain management is more and more complex and managers find that old-style methods fall short in effectively addressing many associated challenges. Although risk management in supply chains is continuing to obtain momentous attention in the extant literature, investigation on risk aspects connecting to tactical sourcing crossways various industry segments from a transnational viewpoint is scant. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of social ties, institutional support and inter-agency collaboration in mitigating service supply chain risk in the healthcare sectors. Qualitative and quantitative approaches were used to collect data from 171 respondents from Ethiopia. Partial least squares structural equation model is applied to examine the association among these latent variables and the dependent variable. The result of the study indicates inter-agency collaboration plays a critical role in managing service supply chain risk, especially in volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity environment.

"© 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  &  Francis Group. Reverse logistics (RL) is emerging as a significant area of activity for business and industry, motivated by both commercial profitability and wider environmental sustainability factors. However, planning and implementing an appropriate RL network within existing supply chains for product recovery that increases customer satisfaction, decreases overall costs, and provides a competitive advantage over other companies is complex. In the current study, we developed a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for a reverse logistics network design (RLND) in a multi-period setting. The RL network consists of collection centres, capacitated inspection and remanufacturing centres and customer zones to serve. Moreover, the model incorporates significant characteristics such as vehicle type selection and carbon emissions (through transportation and operations). Since the network design problems are NP-hard, we first propose a solution approach based on Benders decomposition (BD). Then, based on the structure of the problem we propose a three-phase heuristic approach. Finally, to establish the performance and robustness of the proposed solution approach, the results are compared with benchmark results obtained using CPLEX in terms of both solution quality and computational time. From the computational results, we validated that the three-phase heuristic approach performs superior to the BD and Branch &Cut approach.",A three-phase heuristic approach for reverse logistics network design incorporating carbon footprint,Benders decomposition *** Carbon footprint *** E-waste *** Mixed integer linear programming *** Reverse logistics,international journal of production research,85055525016,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd Chemical supply chains are a crucial component in the ongoing supply of large population centres. Unfortunately, episodes of extreme weather have, in recent years, revealed vulnerabilities in global supply networks to high-impact events. With a possible increase in both frequency and intensity of these events due to climate change, supply chains are at risk of disruption now more than ever, with potential dire economic, societal, and environmental consequences. Acknowledging that the direct application of stochastic programming in this context can quickly lead to very large CPU times, we propose an algorithm that combines the sample average approximation method with a selection heuristic for extreme event scenarios. Our method allows to analyse the tradeoff between economic performance and disruption risk, identifying supply chain configurations which are more resilient against extreme events. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology in multiple case studies, showing how it identifies near optimal solutions in short CPU times.",Strategic planning of supply chains considering extreme events: Novel heuristic and application to the petrochemical industry,Climate change *** Extreme events *** Optimization *** Risk management *** Stochastic programming *** Supply chains,computers and chemical engineering,85063459146,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd The concern about environmental and social impacts of business activities has led to introducing a new paradigm called, sustainable development. It can help to build a low-carbon high-growth global economy and guarantee the global well-being of people. In this paper, three pillars of sustainable development, i.e., economic, environmental, and social, are considered and discussed to design a supply chain network. The proposed model tries to maximize profit primarily while capturing societal community development by prioritizing the less developed regions. Moreover, the model ensures that the environmentally friendly facilities can operate in the supply chain network while others have to be repaired. Furthermore, quantifying the benefits of transportation decisions in terms of both cost and environmental impact savings to improve the sustainability of logistics systems is considered. In addition, the model is regarded as robust programming for the problem to approximate real situations. The proposed model is implemented in some numerical examples and in a real case study. Numerical results and computational analysis are indicative of the significance of the model and through conducting the case study, it is demonstrated that the proposed model can be implemented successfully in practice and it would be beneficial to all the three pillars of sustainable development. Moreover, the managerial insights for the managers of the supply chain networks are provided to make the most appropriate decisions.",Supply chain network design considering sustainable development paradigm: A case study in cable industry,Carbon footprint *** Environmental and social responsibilities *** Robust programming *** Supply chain network design *** Sustainable development *** Water footprint,journal of cleaner production,85067865341,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd To deal with the rising demand of fossil fuels and their associated untoward environmental and economic effects, the feasibility of Indian government's green move towards blending of 20% fuel grade ethanol with gasoline has been studied by performing techno-economic-environmental analysis of second generation lignocellulose biomass as feedstock. An optimized supply chain network (SCN) has been designed with four layers of structure starting from raw material suppliers to the retailers through the layers of the manufacturers and the distributors aiming at the net present value (NPV) maximization. The cost calculation includes operating expenditure (OPEX) and capital expenditure (CAPEX) components involving transport, storage, production and import decisions as linear variables and decisions on connections between two nodes between two consecutive layers as binary variables. The distribution layer of the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model has been uniquely designed for the imported ethanol to serve the twin purposes of meeting the unmet demand as well as enhancing the bio-ethanol product quality in terms of research octane number. The revenue generation is calculated not only from selling the final product but also from the carbon credits calculated using greenhouse gas emission (GHGe) during project life cycle assessment. Further, sensitivity analysis has been performed to show the effect of various parameters such as modes of transport, transport distance limitation on feedstock and product, number of zones, international fuel price fluctuations, feedstock availability on NPV. With ∼80% increase in demand over the 9-year planning horizon, a dynamically changing supply chain (SC) structure shows a ∼36% increase in the newly added locations. Feed availability, critical for Indian scenario, to the tune of at least 40% of the capacity is needed to meet the projected demands.",Bio-Supply Chain Network Design to tackle ethanol deficiency in India: A mathematical framework,Bioethanol *** Blending *** Lignocellulose biomass *** MILP *** NPV *** Supply chain network design,journal of cleaner production,85067889200,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: This paper aims to investigate overlaps, complementarities and divergences between the literature on circular economy (CE) models and related literature in non-linear production models and frameworks, including CE, reverse logistics, closed-loop, industrial symbiosis and industrial ecology. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review was conducted focussing on the benefits of non-linear modes adoption. Findings: The results show a high degree of convergence in findings, gaps and weaknesses of these literatures. Negative environmental, economic and operational impacts are understudied. There is a scarcity of studies identifying practices resulting in empirically tested benefits. The business and society case for non-linear production is still largely built upon conceptual studies, modelling and a few case studies. Despite a normative focus, there is very little use of theory, in particular, management theories. Research limitations/implications: First, the authors use only one, albeit highly recognized database, Scopus. This database may have omitted some relevant research, journals such as the Journal of Cleaner Production and Resources Conservation & Recycling that are more likely to publish such research and also have a more interdisciplinary approach. This is an important gap and interesting result to claim for more interdisciplinary research. Second, the filtering process used and the focus on Association of Business Schools top journals may have also omitted some relevant research, such as a large stream of literature in specialist journals such as Resources Conservation and Recycling and the Journal of Cleaner Production. Practical implications: There are contradictions, tensions and epistemological ambiguity that needs to be critically addressed. Such tensions may be associated with the knowledge field that gave rise to these different non-linear production approaches. Many of them appeared at the same time, but from different sciences and disciplines with their own perspectives. Then in doing so, they create confusion in the definitions of CE, assumptions underlying modelling and business choices arising from this complexity. This can be minimized through the critical interpretation of knowledge to elucidate epistemological quandaries to improve the understanding of the economic, social and environmental impacts of practices. Social implications: In some way, this result makes sense, as the authors have limited the search to management, business and accounts journals, especially talking about Operations Management journals. This is an important gap and interesting result to claim for more interdisciplinary research. Originality/value: In addition to gaps previously described, the authors identified areas of tensions where the literature offers inconclusive – often contradictory – findings requiring further exploration. A better understanding of these tensions is required to understand the impacts of non-linear production and develop policy guidelines for industry and policymakers to scale-up CE.","Circular economy: benefits, impacts and overlapping",Agile systems *** Circular economy *** Circularity *** Closed loop supply chains *** Overlaps *** Systematic literature review *** Theories,supply chain management,85073614937,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG. Textile and garment industry ranks among the world’s dirtiest sectors. The long-term success of the sector will depend on the control of social and environmental resources in the entire product life cycle. The “circular economy” (CE) concept is fast becoming a new model for resilient growth. However, CE continues to be understood largely as a waste management and recycling strategy, but the economic opportunities are far broader and more diverse. The success of the CE in developing countries will be critical to global efforts to ensure sustainable growth. Brazil’s textile and garment industry is the largest complete textile chain in the West and ranks among the world’s top producers of textiles and apparel. This sector is also the second largest generator of manufacturing jobs in Brazil. On the other hand, of the 8 million workers that are estimated, 6.5 are irregular ones. The objective of this paper was to provide a comprehensive review of research efforts encompassing aspects of CE as value network, local production, economic benefits and Brazilian fashion market. By this, it is expected to bring new contributions to neglected issues, the manufacturing base as CE strategy and the social performance. The two main contributions of this research are to highlight Brazilian focus and to find how circular approaches align with and support the already existing domestic industrial and social development strategies.",Brazilian potential for circular fashion through strengthening local production,Brazil *** Circular economy *** Fashion *** Local manufacture *** Supply chain *** Sustainability *** Textile,sn applied sciences,85100789516,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 by the authors. The earlier planning methods of supply chains (SC) in the skeleton of the extended material requirements planning (EMRP), where the time horizon of the reverse Laplace is infinite, were not convenient to estimate the impact of the technical obsolescence of the product or technology involved, which has economic, environmental, and social consequences. Therefore, the perturbations of timing are presented until the possible obsolescence, with parallel execution of the network simulation model (NSM) to evaluate the impact of the finite lifespan on the value of the chain. The EMRP, as well as the NSM, are based on the skeleton of the material requirements planning model, where delays and their perturbations are presented transparently. Contrary to the previous studies of the net present value (NPV) in the EMRP skeleton, where the infinite horizon is assumed, the impact of shortening the horizon of activities is shown here, in order to also evaluate the risk of financing investments in the SC with a shorter lifespan of products or technology. Owing to the simultaneous appearances of the stochastic variables, the parallel execution and exchanging of data, using NSM is advised.

"© 2019 Warsaw University of Technology. All rights reserved. The facility location problem is a popular issue in the literature. The current development of world economies and globalization of the market requires continuous improvement of methods and research in this field. The location of the object determines the time of transport, affects the operational costs of the supply chain, and determines the possible amount of inventory or minimum inventory levels. These are critical issues from the point of view of designing an effective logistics system. The degree of complexity of current decision-making problems requires the construction of mathematical models and support for the decision-maker by optimization and simulation methods. A comprehensive and systemic approach to the problem allows the effective planning of supply chains. The purpose of this article was to study the sensitivity of the warehouse location problem in the supply chain. The solution was obtained based on the methodology developed under the SIMMAG3D project. The article presents the characteristics of the issue of the location of warehouse objects, the mathematical formulation of the solved problem of location and the method of its solution based on the heuristic algorithm using the modification of the Busacker-Gowen method. Then, a supply chain simulation model was developed in the FLEXSIM environment and scenario studies were performed for various input data and model parameters. The analysis and assessment of the solution based on parameters such as utilization of the potential of warehouse objects object were presented. Random change in demand described by Erlang distribution and normal distribution was considered. The analysis showed how the selection of a statistical distribution to describe the input data can affect the shape of the logistics system. The article ends with a summary of considerations and a plan for further research in the use of the simulation environment to support the decision-making process of the location of storage facilities and the functioning of supply chains.",Warehouse location problem in supply chain designing: A simulation analysis,Facilities location *** FLEXSIM *** SIMMAG3D *** Simulation model *** Solution sensitivity testing,archives of transport,85076527167,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd Building-related energy problems place considerable challenges in securing environmental sustainability. Accelerating globalization further exacerbate regional inequities hidden behind the global supply chains. Therefore, the energy use of construction industry embodied in interregional trade needs to be revealed considering the regional disparities. China, as the largest developing country, suffers from massive spending on infrastructure construction. Therefore, investigating the interactions between China's construction industry and the rest of the world is imperative. Previous researches fail to provide a holistic view of energy interactions induced by the global construction industry. This study details the global supply chain of the construction industry by merging 31 Chinese regions into the complex global trading network, which is beneficial for making fair energy reduction strategies. Results show that both embodied energy use and direct energy use exhibit a strong positive linear correlation with GDP. Interregional trade increases the inequality of energy use in the global construction industry, in which 81.67% of the regions possess an energy inequality indicator of the construction industry over 0.80, thus proving that the construction industry consumes a large amount of non-local energy. There is no significant relationship between the embodied intensity and GDP, whereas a weak linear correlation exists between intensity and embodied energy use. In China, Shanxi, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia represent a high intensity. There is a weak positive correlation between urbanization rate and embodied energy values. The findings of this research are critical in understanding the connections between province-level construction activities and the global trading network, which is beneficial for customizing and prioritizing policy recommendations for sustainable development of the global construction industry.",Embodied energy use in the global construction industry,Construction industry *** Global supply chain *** Interregional trade *** Multi-regional input-output analysis,applied energy,85072553129,2019,,,,,,
"With the deepening reform of the power market, the external environment of China's power industry is going through a huge change. China's traditional power generation groups (TPGGs), with assets all over the country, are, due to a lack of market awareness about energy policies, facing serious challenges in developing competitive advantages, improving power transaction modes, optimizing profit models, and even realizing basic corporate strategies. In this study, we focus on identifying the key factors influencing sustainable development in an unprecedented market environment for TPGGs, so as to achieve overall sustainable development for the whole power generation sector in China. A hybrid framework based on Multiple-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) was proposed to recognize the key influencing factors under vague rule conditions. We developed a novel method combining three different MCDM methods with triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs), fuzzy Delphi, fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), and Analytic Network Process (ANP), to cover uncertainty and make the problem-solving approach closer to the actual problem. A series of analyses indicate that the final 14 factors covering the five dimensions are considered to be important factors in the sustainable development of TPGGs. Based on the results, it can be said that Gross energy margin and Pricing bidding strategy dominate the impacts of TPGG's sustainable development. Finally, we give some advice relating to practical measures to help TPGGs achieve sustainable development in the market-oriented industry environment.",Identification of Key Influencing Factors of Sustainable Development for Traditional Power Generation Groups in a Market by Applying an Extended MCDM Model,corporate sustainability *** influencing factors *** traditional power generation groups (TPGGs) *** fuzzy Delphi model *** fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method *** ANP technique,sustainability,WOS:000464350400021,2019,,,,,,
"The application of the agent-based simulation approach in the flow-shop production environment has recently gained popularity among researchers. The concept of agent and agent functions can help to automate a variety of difficult tasks and assist decision-making in flow-shop production. This is especially so in the large-scale Original Equipment Manufacturing (OEM) industry, which is associated with many uncertainties. Among these are uncertainties in customer demand requirements that create disruptions that impact production planning and scheduling, hence, making it difficult to satisfy demand in due time, in the right order delivery sequence, and in the right item quantities. It is however important to devise means of adapting to these inevitable disruptive problems by accommodating them while minimising the impact on production performance and customer satisfaction. In this paper, an innovative embedded agent-based Production Disruption Inventory-Replenishment (PDIR) framework, which includes a novel adaptive heuristic algorithm and inventory replenishment strategy which is proposed to tackle the disruption problems. The capabilities and functionalities of agents are utilised to simulate the flow-shop production environment and aid learning and decision making.

"The EU directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) imposes the obligation to collect a large share of the end-of-life products on electronics manufacturers. Environmental aspects, however, are often considered only rudimentarily. Based on previous research and real-world data, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model of a European reverse network for WEEE is developed, including collection, high-value recovery, or third-party collection and recycling. The results comprise optimal network decisions and corresponding opportunity costs for economic and 21 environmental categories (18 midpoints, 3 endpoints). The evaluation of the environmental impact is based on data from the ecoinvent database, characterized using the ReCiPe 2016 Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) method. The results unveil conflicts and congruencies between the objectives. Collection and high-value recovery are preferable in up to six countries for economically optimal networks and in up to 15 countries with optimal benefit for global warming and fossil resource depletion. Discrepancies in objective values are larger between economic and most of the environmental solutions than in between most of the environmental ones. The dimensions land use and freshwater eutrophication show the least conflicts with the economic rationale. Solutions for mineral resource depletion prefer third-party collection and recycling. Conflicts between solutions are resolved by the e-constraint method. Sensitivity analyses show the robustness of key findings. This study emphasizes the importance of a broad assessment of environmental impacts as well as mutual economic and environmental opportunity costs in large-scale recovery networks for WEEE.

"The growing concern for the environment and imperative need for technology-enabled energy efficient freight transportation have led to the development of dedicated freight corridors (DFCs) in many countries like Germany, Netherlands, Austria, and India. The rapid expansion of DFCs is needed to improve supply chain efficiency. DFCs have potential to decongest existing rail networks, reduce the modal share of road freight transportation, and decarbonize freight transport sector. This study attempts to use transition management theory for identifying enablers of DFC for the transition from road to rail freight transportation. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is employed to confirm the three-level transition management framework for these enablers. This paper also proposes an eight-level hierarchical total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) based model for explicating the inter-relationships among the enablers of DFC to decarbonize freight transportation and achieve sustainability in the freight transport sector. Eventually, this paper provides empirical evidence to identify and validate the enablers of DFC through the lens of transition management theory. This paper also highlights the role of 'adoption of advanced technologies' to achieve sustainability in freight transportation. The outcomes of this study also facilitate policy-makers in understanding and managing the key enablers of DFCs to decarbonize freight transport sector.",Decarbonizing freight transportation: An integrated EFA-TISM approach to model enablers of dedicated freight corridors,Sustainable freight transportation *** Dedicated freight corridor *** Transition management theory *** Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) *** Total interpretive structural modeling (TISM),technological forecasting and social change,WOS:000470043000009,2019,,,,,,
"Pressure from legislation and customers has motivated companies to consider reverse logistics (RL) in their operations. Since it is a complex procedure that requires an adequate system, the recent trend consists in outsourcing RL to third-party reverse logistics providers (3PRLPs). This paper provides the background of sustainable triple bottom line theory with focus on economic, environmental, and social aspects under 3PRL concerns. The relevant sustainability criteria are used in a case study conducted in cooperation with an Indian automotive remanufacturing company. To select the most preferred service provider, we use a hybrid method combining a variant of ELECTRE I accounting for the effect of reinforced preference, the revised Simos procedure, and Stochastic Multi-criteria Acceptability Analysis. The incorporated approach exploits all parameters of an outranking model compatible with the incomplete preference information of the Decision Maker. In particular, it derives the newly defined kernel acceptability and membership indices that can be interpreted as a support given to the selection of either a particular subset of alternatives or a single option. The proposed ELECTRE-based method enriches the spectrum of multiple criteria decision analysis approaches that can be used to effectively approach the problem of the 3PRLP selection. As indicated by the extensive review presented in the paper, this application field was so far dominated by Analytic Hierarchy Process and TOPSIS, whose weaknesses can be overcome by applying the outranking methods.

"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate how local supply chains prepare for and respond to the threats and opportunities presented by constitutional change, thereby building resilience. Design/methodology/approach Multiple case study analysis of 14 firms in the food sector is presented in the context of the UK's impending exit from the European Union (Brexit). Organisations studied include farmers, processors, retailers and non-government organisations (NGOs). Data from interviews and roundtable discussions has been interpreted using the dynamic capabilities perspective, covering the sensing, seizing, and transforming stages. Findings The data highlights the importance of both vertical and horizontal collaboration between supply chain actors as they seek to anticipate the impact of the disruption and influence the future shape of the constitution. There is also evidence to suggest firms in possession of dynamic capabilities can innovate to build resilience and enhance their competitive position. Characteristics of the disruption posed by constitutional change are identified and contrast with those of many other threats more typically described in the literature. As a result, the process of building resilience is different.

"A truly sustainable urban transportation network (SUTN) needs to be sustainable in all aspects including economic, social and environmental dimensions. Identifying the evaluation criteria for sustainability of urban transportation network (UTN) and evaluating importance of these criteria, are completely critical. While most researches have only focused on economic aspect of transportation systems (TSs), in this paper, by considering economic, social and environmental dimensions, the evaluation criteria for evaluating the sustainability of UTN have been identified. Then a framework based on Best Worst Method, has been proposed to evaluate and prioritize sustainability dimensions and evaluation criteria. To show the usefulness of the proposed model, it is applied to a real-world case study of transportation in Isfahan, one of the largest cities in Iran. The results from this study are used for evaluating and selecting real transportation projects. We have also shown how the proposed framework helps managers and experts for analyzing sustainability of existing UTN, identifying potential strategies, evaluating and selecting new policies or constructing projects to achieve sustainability goals.",Determining the relative importance of sustainability evaluation criteria of urban transportation network,Sustainability *** Urban transportation network *** Sustainable transportation network design *** Multi criteria decision making *** Best Worst Method,sustainable cities and society,WOS:000471280400046,2019,,,,,,
"Despite increasing research on sustainability, there has been lack of understanding of how to manage front-end uncertainties and back-end complexities related to sustainability initiatives. We argue for management integrity and management accountability as two motivational mechanisms for achieving sustainability outcomes. In this study we also present how firms translate strategic intent of sustainability into product differentiation criteria which are further implemented through internal cross-functional processes and external network practices. Research model defines variables related to strategic sustainability orientation and sustainability performance outcomes. Data were collected from 749 enterprises from both advanced and emerging markets. Research results report that strategic formulation involves translating sustainability orientation in the form of order winning criteria to both cross-functional units and suppliers whereas operational execution requires integrating organizational processes to achieve complex performance outcomes. The findings also suggest that demand-based production becomes a crucial mediating variable for impacting comprehensive performance outcomes. This article also shows social aspects of sustainability in terms of internal (e.g., safety and health conditions) and external stakeholders (e.g., development and welfare of the society).

"The need to build an efficient procurement system has been recognized as one of the main obstacles to the extension of the bioenergy industry. Transportation is a key component of that system, as it accounts for a significant portion of the delivered cost. One of the most critical factors affecting transportation cost is the interrelationship between feedstock sources and facility locations, including plant and off-plant transfer / storage facilities. At the same time, biomass energy sustainability is sensitive to the performance of each component in the entire process. The main goal of this study is to build a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that uses region-specific data to minimize sustainable transportation costs. This consists of economic, environmental, and societal factors. The upstream air emissions as a result of residues collection at the forest, transloading, and transportation by truck or multimodally (truck and rail), which include greenhouse gases (GHG), particulate matter (PM), and nitrogen oxides (NOx), are calculated and included in the analysis. The model was tested on a case study that evaluated transportation costs for nine alternative plant locations in the state of Wisconsin. The results revealed that when equally weighed, external (social and environmental) costs accounted for a considerable portion of total transportation cost (approximately 26-37%). The study also shows that total upstream GHG and air emissions increased as the plant capacity increased, due to the longer transportation distances, but per unit emissions decreased.

"Due to the increasing awareness of climate change, depletion of natural resources, and increasing world population, companies in the agri-food sector need to redesign their existing supply chains and take into account both the economic and environmental impact of their operations. In practice not all the required information is available in advance due to various sources of uncertainty in agri-food supply chains. In this research a multi-objective two-stage stochastic programming model is proposed to analyse and evaluate the economic and environmental impacts to account for uncertainty in agri-food supply chains. A mushroom supply chain in the Netherlands is presented as an illustrative case study. Optimal production planning decisions calculated with a two-stage stochastic programming model are compared with the results of an equivalent deterministic model. The results of the optimizations show that accounting for stochasticity in important model parameters can reduce the difference between expected and realized economic performance by approximately 4% on average. Moreover, this paper demonstrates that including stochastic model parameters can reduce the environmental impact without compromising the current economic performance. Given the assumptions in the setup of the case study and the available information, it is concluded that applying a 2-stage stochastic programming approach for production planning decisions can lead to improved economic and environmental performance in an agri-food supply chain. New findings in real-life case studies are needed to get profound insights and understanding on the impact of uncertainty on production planning decisions in sustainable agri-food supply chains.

"Corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the seafood industry is on the rise. Because of increasing public awareness and non-governmental organization (NGO) campaigns, seafood buyers have made various commitments to improve the sustainability of their wild seafood sourcing. As part of this effort, seafood suppliers have developed their own CSR programs in order to meet buyers' sourcing requirements. However, the CSR of these companies, many of which are mid-supply chain or vertically integrated, remain largely invisible and unstudied. In order to better understand how mid-chain seafood suppliers engage in sustainability efforts, we reviewed the CSR practices of the 25 largest seafood companies globally (by revenue) that deal with wild seafood products. Based on literature, existing frameworks, and initial data analysis, we developed a structured framework to identify and categorize practices based on the issues addressed and the approach used. We found companies implement CSR to address four key areas, and through various activities that fit into five categories: Power; Practices; Partnerships; Public policy; and Philanthropy. One of the biggest gaps identified in this study is the lack of accountability mechanisms, as well as robust and consistent accounting of impacts. Indeed, many companies express commitments without clear goals and structures in place to ensure implementation. Therefore, improvements in seafood company performance on social and environmental aspects may not only require creating a better business case for CSR, but also require ensuring that companies have the necessary processes and structures in place through public oversights and regulations.",Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Practices of the Largest Seafood Suppliers in the Wild Capture Fisheries Sector: From Vision to Action,corporate social responsibility *** private governance *** greening supply chains *** sustainable supply chain management *** eco-certification *** sustainable seafood,sustainability,WOS:000467752200067,2019,,,,,,
"Sustainability in supply chain management is an inescapable and controversial issue due to government legislation and social responsibilities of the organizations. For that reason, a sustainable supply chain network design (SSND) has been recently developed as a means of dealing with environmental and social issues along with the economic aspect of a supply chain. On the other hand, considering uncertainty and risk aversion in the supply chain network design due to the volatility of the markets and the unavailability of sufficient information is inevitable. Thus, in this paper, a risk-averse sustainable multi-objective mathematical model is proposed in order to design and plan a network of the supply chain under uncertainty by incorporating Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) into the basic configuration of the two-stage stochastic programming. In some other cases, many organizations offer some sort of discount to their customers so that they can compete with their rivals and enhance their accounts receivable. So, it seems ineluctable for companies to contemplate considering discount policies while making such strategic decisions for sustainability. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem in order to consider discounts in the proposed model. Sensitivity analyses are also conducted on some important risk-aversion parameters in order to evaluate how these parameters affect the proposed mathematical model and the obtained Pareto solutions.",A stochastic risk-averse sustainable supply chain network design problem with quantity discount considering multiple sources of uncertainty,Supply chain network design *** Sustainability *** Risk-aversion *** CVaR *** Quantity discount,computers & industrial engineering,WOS:000466825100034,2019,,,,,,

"Energy and water are important resources for sustainable development. Due to large amounts of demand in the energy production, water is becoming a critical factor for energy policy making, especially for resource-dependent areas. Direct users from the production-based method and indirect drivers from the consumption-based method are identified in existing studies, but transmission sectors in the intermediate supply chains are usually ignored. To reconcile the relationship between energy and water, we carry on a case study in Shanxi Province and use input-output tables in 2007 and 2012 to measure the betweenness of sectors. Results shows that Mining and Processing of Metal Ores is the key transmission sector measured by betweenness-based method but usually ignored by other existing methods. Moreover, tertiary industry, such as Transportation, Storage and Posts, Hotel and Restaurants, plays an increasing significant role as transmission centers in the upstream supply chains. Efficiency improvement in these sectors may also help reduce water stress in the energy production. To encourage better decisions and avoid unintended results, betweenness-based results should be considered as a complementary part for energy and water policy formulation.","Regional energy-water nexus based on structural path betweenness: A case study of Shanxi Province, China",Coal production *** Virtual water *** Input-output analysis *** Structural path analysis *** Betweenness,energy policy,WOS:000463688200011,2019,,,,,,
"Given the current food supply chain (SC) situations that generates substantial amount of wastes and emissions (CO(2)e) starting from input supply point to the marketing; increasing demand for food for growing population, requirements of water, and energy for processing the food, it is not sustainable. In addition, it is exposed to natural calamity and risks from supply, production and quality system failures and other disruptions and disasters. As such a sustainable food SC network design model is proposed that integrates resilience criteria, lean, and green based practices to overcome limitations of the current practices of the chain and improve its performances. The research designs and plans sustainable food collection regional grids, their potential locations, capacities, operations, establishment of relationship with food processing centers, and big-name retailers. The model is defined as a deterministic model to improve sustainability performance of a grid based supply chain network. Each grid is run by food collection cooperatives formed by the local farmers or small business organization. The research contributes by designing and planning potential grid locations, their capacities and integrates resilience criteria and lean based practices for improving sustainability performances. Applicability of the model is illustrated by the grid network of an example region (state).","Integrating Lean, Green, and Resilience Criteria in a Sustainable Food Supply Chain Planning Model",Sustainable food supply chain *** Resilience criteria *** Lean and green criteria *** Regional supply chain grids *** Food collection cooperatives,international journal of mathematical engineering and management sciences,WOS:000556963700001,2019,,,,,,
"The practice of upstream firms (suppliers) and downstream firms co-creating products (goods or services) together has a long history in business markets. We analyze the strategic choices of two competing downstream firms who simultaneously decide whether or not to co-create with an upstream supplier. Within this framework we incorporate endogenous pricing and effort choices by the upstream supplier and the downstream firms. Downstream firms contemplating co-creation with a supplier are faced with a trade-off. On the one hand they can benefit from the supplier's innovation efforts and therefore obtain a better product. On the other hand, they are confronted with the adverse effect of their own innovation efforts spilling over to their rivals via the supplier who would sell the co-created product to all firms. Our model captures this tension and offers several insights. First, we show that all the channel members (the supplier and the firms) are getting higher profits when they all co-create together, as compared to the situation where there is no co creation and the Supplier alone designs the product. However, we also demonstrate that the abovementioned trade-offs provide an incentive for firms to deviate from this outcome, sometimes resulting in no-co-creation between the downstream firms and upstream supplier in equilibrium. Further, we show that in the competitive co-creation environment, ex-ante symmetric firms may pursue asymmetric strategies in equilibrium. The asymmetric equilibrium, in which only one of the two firms co-creates with the supplier, is obtained when the degree of price sensitivity to competitor's product in the consumer market is moderate. Third, we find two types of asymmetric equilibria. For moderately low degrees of price sensitivity, all parties prefer the asymmetric outcome. For moderately high price sensitivity, both firms prefer co-creation, but the supplier will refuse to co-create with one of them thereby enforcing the asymmetric outcome. Thus, a strategic supplier's role is critical in that it expands the region where the asymmetric equilibrium takes place, beyond the one preferred by the firms themselves. We also show that, when firms compete in the end-consumer market, the supplier may exert lower innovation effort when it co-creates with two firms as compared to one. This is not the case in the absence of competition between the downstream firms. Finally, and counterintuitively, a higher degree of product fit for the rival can actually benefit the co-creating firm in the asymmetric outcome, even though it improves its rival's product.

"With the environment deterioration becoming a serious concern, numerous industries have realized that it's critical to focus on manufacturing with reduced waste and low carbon emission. Studies show that consumers are getting cognizant of environment preservation and prefer low-carbon developed products. It is seen that in some cases, customers are willing to pay even more for products developed using low carbon emission technologies. Furthermore, government initiatives towards going green has resulted in industries focusing on reducing their carbon footprints throughout the supply chain by employing green supply chain methodologies. In this study, we will develop an inventory model for deteriorating items in green supply chain considering recycling, reverse logistics and remanufacturing. Demand is assumed to be carbon dependent. Products are considered to be deteriorating in nature with time dependent deterioration rate. A crisp model is developed to minimize total average cost. In the crisp model, it is assumed that demand, deterioration and returned rate are precisely known. However, in reality these parameters are imprecise in nature. To model this impreciseness, a fuzzy model is developing considering these parameters as triangular fuzzy numbers. Total cost function is defuzzified using signed distance method and is shown to be convex and a unique solution exists. Numerical analysis is carried out for both crisp and fuzzy cases.",Fuzzy inventory model for deteriorating items in a green supply chain with carbon concerned demand,Green supply chain *** Reverse logistics *** Carbon dependent demand *** Deterioration *** Fuzzy model *** Signed distance method,opsearch,WOS:000461809200005,2019,,,,,,
"A growing body of scholarship analyzes the emergence and resilience of forced labor in developing countries within global value chains. However, little is known about how forced labor arises within domestic supply chains concentrated within national borders,producing products for domestic consumption. We conduct one of the first studies of forced labor in domestic supply chains,through a cross-industry comparison of the regulatory gaps surrounding forced labor in the United Kingdom. We find that understanding the dynamics of forced labor in domestic supply chains requires us to conceptually modify the global value chain framework to understand similarities and differences across these contexts. We conclude that addressing the governance gaps that surround forced labor will require scholars and policymakers to carefully refine their thinking about how we might design operative governance that effectively engages with local variation.",Governance gaps in eradicating forced labor: From global to domestic supply chains,global supply chain *** modern slavery *** forced labor *** global value chain *** governance *** domestic public policy,regulation & governance,WOS:000460845300001,2019,,,,,,
"Purpose This paper aims to highlight the challenges and opportunities of sustainable global value chain governance, it demonstrates strong theoretical deficits in this field and offers new pragmatist conceptual perspectives. Design/methodology/approach The empirical analysis is based on document analyses, 47 expert interviews and on field observations in Ghana, Africa. Findings Based on an in-depth analysis of a US firm operating a fair trade value chain in an intercultural environment, the authors show that universalistic value chain-oriented governance instruments often fail because of strong institutional and cultural distances. Against the prevailing strategies of top-down management, the authors suggest a more bottom-up, pragmatist and collaboration-based approach to sustainable global value chain governance. Research limitations/implications The results of an in-depth case study are not generalizable. Instead, they provide holistic insights into a so-far insufficiently examined field and an empirical fundament for further research on sustainable governance in global value chains. In particular, research on pragmatist, collaborative, dialogue based, bottom-up approaches of sustainable value chain governance will be of great value to further theoretical development of this field. Practical implications his study is relevant to researchers and practitioners in the field of sustainable value chain governance. It reveals several misunderstandings about the effectiveness and impacts of sustainable governance in less developed countries and thus builds a foundation for better and more effective problem-solving approaches in international sustainable management activities. Social implications Nontransparent supplier networks and ( illegal) sub-contracting, as well as the strong influences of institutional, cultural and sub-cultural factors, make responsible value chain management a challenging task for any firm with international value creation activities. This leaves workers in local factories vulnerable to infringements of their fundamental human rights and the environment unprotected against long-lasting damages. Addressing these challenges and developing new solutions, therefore, can have strong impacts on the lives of workers in international supply chains. Originality/value The authors contribute, first, a differentiated empirical description and analysis of a sustainable value chain approach in a less developed country in Africa. Second, using an example of the field study, the authors highlight limitations of value chain-related governance theory based on a field study by illustrating the challenges and barriers and a lack of existing concepts concerning effective sustainable governance in global value chains. Third, the authors show different managerial responses to these cultural and institutional challenges between universalism and relativism, and, fourth, the authors suggest a more collaborative, bottom-up and pragmatist approach to sustainable value chain governance.",A pragmatist perspective on sustainable global value chain governance - the case of Dr. Bronner's,Governance *** Value chain *** Supply chain *** Africa *** Ghana,society and business review,WOS:000458448800002,2019,,,,,,
"Purpose Today's, supply chain production and distribution of products to improve the customer satisfaction in the shortest possible time by paying the minimum cost, has become the most important challenge in global market. On the other hand, minimizing the total cost of the transportation and distribution is one of the critical items for companies. To handle this challenge, this paper aims to present a multi-objective multi-facility model of green closed-loop supply chain (GCLSC) under uncertain environment. In this model, the proposed GCLSC considers three classes in case of the leading chain and three classes in terms of the recursive chain. The objectives are to maximize the total profit of the GCLSC, satisfaction of demand, the satisfactions of the customers and getting to the proper cost of the consumers, distribution centers and recursive centers. Design/methodology/approach Then, this model is designed by considering several products under several periods regarding the recovery possibility of products. Finally, to evaluate the proposed model, several numerical examples are randomly designed and then solved using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm and non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm. Then, they are ranked by TOPSIS along with analytical hierarchy process so-called analytic hierarchy process-technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (AHP-TOPSIS). Findings The results indicated that non-dominated ranked genetic algorithm (NRGA) algorithm outperforms non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) algorithm in terms of computation times. However, in other metrics, any significant difference was not seen. At the end, to rank the algorithms, a multi-criterion decision technique was used. The obtained results of this method indicated that NSGA-II had better performance than ones obtained by NRGA. Originality/value This study is motivated by the need of integrating the leading supply chain and retrogressive supply chain. In short, the highlights of the differences of this research with the mentioned studies are as follows: developing multi-objective multi-facility model of fuzzy GCLSC under uncertain environment and integrating the leading supply chain and retrogressive supply chain.",Multi-objective multi-facility green manufacturing closed-loop supply chain under uncertain environment,Multi-objective optimization *** Genetic algorithms *** Closed-loop supply chain *** TOPSIS *** Analytical hierarchy process,assembly automation,WOS:000466754800006,2019,,,,,,
"Storage of municipality solid waste (MSW) in landfills is a traditional practice of the past. Negative impacts of landfills have motivated interest in the sustainable utilization of MSW. In this study, we cover the treatment of the MSW supply chain problem. The supply chain network is composed by several arcs connecting sources of MSW by treatment facilities, and markets imposing demand for products. A two-stage stochastic MILP model is formulated to examine the effects of the supply-demand, and power price uncertainties. The first stage decision variables involve technology and capacity selection. The second stage decision variables deal with transportation, and power production. An L-shaped decomposition algorithm is shown to be effective in obtaining solutions for the stochastic model. A risk model is adopted to analyze the financial risk in the organic MSW supply chain problem. A case study is examined to show the application of the mathematical programming formulation.

"Recently, big data (BD) has attracted researchers and practitioners due to its potential usefulness in decision-making processes. Big data analytics (BDA) is becoming increasingly popular among manufacturing companies as it helps gain insights and make decisions based on BD. However, there many barriers to the adoption of BDA in manufacturing supply chains. It is therefore necessary for manufacturing companies to identify and examine the nature of each barrier. Previous studies have mostly built conceptual frameworks for BDA in a given situation and have ignored examining the nature of the barriers to BDA. Due to the significance of both BD and BDA, this research aims to identify and examine the critical barriers to the adoption of BDA in manufacturing supply chains in the context of Bangladesh. This research explores the existing body of knowledge by examining these barriers using a Delphi-based analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Data were obtained from five Bangladeshi manufacturing companies. The findings of this research are as follows: (i) data-related barriers are most important, (ii) technology-related barriers are second, and (iii) the five most important components of these barriers are (a) lack of infrastructure, (b) complexity of data integration, (c) data privacy, (d) lack of availability of BDA tools and (e) high cost of investment. The findings can assist industrial managers to understand the actual nature of the barriers and potential benefits of using BDA and to make policy regarding BDA adoption in manufacturing supply chains. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to justify the robustness of the barrier rankings.",Barriers to big data analytics in manufacturing supply chains: A case study from Bangladesh,AHP *** Big data analytics *** Barriers to BDA *** Delphi *** Information and communication technology (ICT) *** Manufacturing supply chains,computers & industrial engineering,WOS:000458221900082,2019,,,,,,
"Recently, the topic of designing a closed loop supply chain network has attracted researchers' attention due to the enormous financial and environmental benefits obtained from its practices. This paper addresses a new model of designing a closed loop supply chain network, which considers a downward product substitution policy under four carbon emission regulation policies: carbon cap, carbon tax, carbon cap-and-trade and carbon offset. To solve the assumed uncertainties of product demand and number of products returned, robust optimization is adopted. The aim of the model proposed is to select which facility to open/operate, select a transportation mode and determine the quantity of shipped and substituted products. We show a numerical example of using the four carbon emission regulation policies.",robust closed loop supply chain network design under different carbon emission policies,Carbon regulatory policies *** Closed loop supply chain *** Downward substitution *** Robust optimization,pamukkale university journal of engineering sciences-pamukkale universitesi muhendislik bilimleri dergisi,WOS:000504909200002,2019,,,,,,

"Health service is a very complex and expensive public service and it is a highly sensitive service that highly determines the human capital besides knowledge. In this study we used six technology dimensions (product design, patient relationship management, supply chain management, knowledge management, environment, and governance structure), that highly determine an effective adoption of telehealth health care service. We used DNAP model (DEMATEL and ANP) to evaluate and prioritize the weights of the factors that influence an investment in telemedicine health care service. The results of this study show that product design and patient relationship management has a higher interaction with the rest of the selected dimensions such as knowledge management, supply chain management, governance, and environment. Within the product design with respect to the rest of the dimensions, behavioral requirement ranks first, next knowledge requirement, and third technology requirement; patient relationship management with respect to the rest of the dimensions, the ranking is: social network ranks first, next patient service, and third empowerment.",Critical Factors Determining Adoption of Telemedicine,Telemedicine *** ANP *** DEMATEL *** Knowledge management,international journal of online and biomedical engineering,WOS:000475762100008,2019,,,,,,

"Over the past few years, water allocation problem has increasingly spotlighted by governments, researchers and practitioners. As water plays an important role in people's life and business environment, the problem of water allocation should be considered carefully to properly satisfy demand of water consumers. In the real world applications, problems like water allocation are uncertain owing to long-term planning horizon of such problems. Therefore, employing efficient methods for tackling uncertainty of parameters should be regarded by field researchers. In this regard, this paper proposes a bi-objective mathematical programming model for water distribution network design. The extended model maximizes total profit of water distribution as well as maximizing priority of water transferring among water customer zones. Then, to cope effectively with uncertainty of parameters, a novel robust possibilistic programming method is applied. Then, fuzzy and robust fuzzy programming models are compared against each other and output results confirm superiority and effective performance of the robust fuzzy model in the water allocation problem. Also, output results of the extended model show its accurate performance that results in applicability of the model as a strong planning tool in real world cases.",A ROBUST POSSIBILISTIC PROGRAMMING MODEL FOR WATER ALLOCATION PROBLEM,Water allocation problem *** uncertainty *** robust possibilistic programming,rairo-operations research,WOS:000460376000017,2019,,,,,,
"The purpose of this paper is to assess supply chain reconfigurability in a global scenario. The paper attempts to measure comprehensive relative reconfigurability index (CRRI) in an automobile case supply chain by holistically considering fifteen enablers of reconfigurability. The present research evaluates CRRI by utilizing two distinct assessment models that calculate relative reconfigurability index (RRI). Firstly, a deterministic assessment model is developed from the total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) digraph, and secondly, an integrated assessment methodology that utilizes both the Delphi technique and the additive weighting method to calculate RRI. The uniqueness of the present research is to quantify reconfigurability in the case supply chain by a numerical index termed as CRRI. The paper analyzes the level of reconfigurability competence of the case supply chain in comparison with an ideal supply chain and thus facilitates structural flexibility. The proposed model for calculating CRRI, using two methodologies and comparing the results, is an innovative way of measuring supply chain reconfigurability. Supply chain's preparedness to structurally change in the present business environment of uncertainty and turbulence can be evaluated and it would act as an aide in decision making pertaining to reconfigurability in supply chains.",Measuring Supply Chain Reconfigurability using Integrated and Deterministic Assessment Models,Supply chain network *** Reconfigurability index *** Delphi technique *** Additive weighting method *** Kendall's coefficient concordance (W) *** Total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) *** Assessment models,journal of manufacturing systems,WOS:000488660800016,2019,,,,,,
"The perishability of blood platelets complicates the management of their supply chain. This paper studies the impact of energy consumption and carbon emissions of transportation activities in a blood platelet supply chain. Energy consumption and carbon emissions vary significantly, and the effective location-allocation of blood facilities is a key strategy for the optimal use of energy. The total cost of the supply chain for perishable products is minimized when energy consumption is optimized. The proposed model is too complex to be solved with existing methodologies; therefore, mathematical tools are used to solve it. A numerical experiment is carried out to validate the proposed model, and graphical representations are presented for better visualization of the study's outcomes.

"© 2019 by the authors. Environmental concerns have globally driven the encouragement of green supply chain management. Accordingly, business and industrial organizations try to seek green supply chain strategies to respond to market pressure regarding corporate social responsibility. Green supplier selection is one of the practical strategies for modern enterprises. With the large-scale development of the palm oil products industry, green supplier selection technique is the key for decision making when dealing with mass information and possible risks of biased data. For instance, the preference of decision makers possibly causes a misleading decision, thus leading to unnecessary waste of resources. Therefore, the contribution of this paper is to apply the integrated multi-criteria decision method using the 'fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory' (fuzzy DEMATEL) method to consider the cause and effect relationship and then using fuzzy analytic network process (fuzzy ANP) to assign the weight of each relevant criteria. The initial results are useful for strategic procurement planning. In the final step, we adopt the prospect theory to synthesize procurement's psychological and behavioral factors when selecting green suppliers. The final result refers to the comprehensive prospect value to rank the eligible suppliers into orders. Moreover, the results of both sensitivity analysis and comparison method confirm that the proposed model is adequately realistic and robust.",An integrated multi-criteria decision-making model based on prospect theory for green supplier selection under uncertain environment: A case study of the Thailand palm oil products industry,Fuzzy ANP *** Fuzzy DEMATEL *** Green supplier selection *** Palm oil products industry *** Procurement strategy *** Prospect theory,sustainability (switzerland),85064052444,2019,,,,,,
"Since resilient supplier selection problems (RSSPs) are regarded vague, uncertain and complex, interval-valued fuzzy sets (IVFSs) and possibilistic statistical theories can assist to deal with preferences and experience of group of experts into meaningful results to appraise the potential suppliers. This research presents a novel comprehensive possibilistic statistical group decision approach with IVFSs and asymmetric information to solve RSSPs in the supply chain networks (SCNs). Possibilistic statistical concepts, including mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis, are proposed for the first time in the literature of SCNs for the group decision process. Also, asymmetric information with IVFSs is provided in the presented approach along with introducing two new extensions of weighting methods for experts as well as evaluation criteria. In addition, new relations, new separation measures and novel distinguish indices are introduced regarding to the preference by similarity to ideal solutions with mean-variance-skewness-kurtosis modeling.

"Due to an increase environmental awareness and stringent legislation, electronic companies attempt to move towards environmental protection and extend their efforts to integrate green competencies across their forward and reverse supply chain. Environmental performance of companies not only rely on design and manufacturing aspects but it is also affected by the partners' social as well as environmental performance. For companies, recycling and assets recovery process, as well as final disposal of waste of electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), requires recycling partners to be equipped with green competencies (GC). With the scope of this paper, selection of most desirable recycling partner is an important task and complex decision for managers of electronic companies. This paper presents a three-phase novel hybrid methodology for partner selection by electronic companies. The first phase involves extensive literature for identification of green competencies (GC) criteria and then finalize seven main criteria and forty-eight sub-criteria with experts' opinion, the second phase involves fuzzy AHP method which is used to calculate relative weight and rank the selection criteria and third phase involves ranking of recycling partners' alternative with respect to GC criteria weights using novel VIKOR. Sensitivity analysis is also conducted to check the robustness and stability of the framework. The results indicate that resource and environmental management capabilities (REC), green core competencies (GCC), and regulatory obligation and risk compliance (RRC) are the key criteria for partner selection process.

"Nowadays, sustainability is one of the leading value-increasing strategies of industrial corporations. In order to implement a sustainable strategy, it is necessary to assess the sustainability performance. Nevertheless, this still represents a relevant gap in the literature and practice. There are a number of frameworks and tools for sustainability performance assessment. Most of them are based on a set of indicators. However, in many corporations the sets are applied and kept disaggregated. Due to this deficiency, aggregated sustainability assessment approaches are often explored by researchers and practitioners. One of the main approaches is the use of multi criteria decision making methods which transform multiple indicator values to a single dimension. Since there are many complex interdependencies among the used sustainability key performance indicators and their relations are uncertain, Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP) appears to be an appropriate tool for aggregated assessing the sustainability performance. The aim of this paper is to develop and verify a methodology for aggregated sustainability performance assessment of an industrial corporation using the FANP approach. Based on analysis of the existing FANP approaches and discussion of their advantages and disadvantages, Logarithmic Fuzzy Preference Programming Methodology was selected for this purpose. Our developed methodology provides a comprehensive aggregated sustainability performance assessment system based on combining three evaluation methods (basic evaluation, trend evaluation, and categorization), and Action matrix, which defines appropriate corrective actions level to achieve the sustainability performance targets. A case study from metallurgical industry was used to verify the developed methodology and to identify critical points and recommendations for its implementation. (C) 2019 The Authors.

"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present a methodology for research through game design and discuss how simulation games can be used to bridge the gap between operational exercises and simulation or analytical modelling and to provide guidelines on how simulation games can be designed for different research purposes in the context of humanitarian logistics. Design/methodology/approach This paper combines a literature review on gaming as a research method with an analysis of requirements for humanitarian logistics research methods. Starting from this theoretical framework, the authors develop a design thinking approach that highlights how games can be used for different research purposes. To illustrate the approach, the authors develop two different game set-ups that are of increasing fidelity and complexity. Finally, the authors discuss the results of the evaluation of both approaches, reflect on the design choices and provide recommendations for research and practice. Findings Gaming is a suitable research method to explore and analyse behaviour and decisions in emergent settings that require team work and collaborative problem solving. Especially when safety and security concerns may hinder access and experimentation on site, gaming can offer a realistic and engaging quasi-experimental environment. The aspects of engagement and realism also make gaming a suitable tool to combine training and research. Originality/value Although the use of games has attracted some attention in commercial supply chain management and crisis response, there is no systematic overview of gaming as a research method in humanitarian logistics.

"Implementation of closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) has gained increased consideration in the last few years owing to an increase in environmental concerns, product returns and scarcity of natural resources. It aids in improving environmental, economic and social performances. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of CLSC critical success factors (CSFs) on performance outcomes. Firstly, CSFs and performance outcomes are extracted by conducting exploratory factor analysis using SPSS software. Then, the relationships between CLSC CSFs and performance outcomes are empirically tested by Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) approach, using the data collected from 138 professionals working in remanufacturing, refurbishing and recycling operations in North American manufacturing organisations. Empirical analysis demonstrates that CSFs, 'environmental concerns', 'sustainable production' and 'product design and collection' have a significant positive effect on environmental performance. Results also validate the significant positive effect of CSFs, 'demand and inventory management' and 'raw material prices' on economic performance. In our knowledge, this is the first study that examines the impact of CLSC CSFs on performance outcomes.

"Environmental disaster and rapid climate change cautioned government bodies and environmental protection agencies, which resulted in legislations forcing business organizations to restrict their carbon emissions to make their supply chain a disaster resilient supply chain. In supply chain, carbon emissions are seen light away from the procurement of raw materials till the distribution of finished goods through logistics. Hence, there is strong need to fix carbon emissions and to make existing supply chain an environmentally sustainable supply chain to gain environmental disaster relief. This paper primarily focuses on minimizing carbon emissions in the raw material procurement and its logistics using a cap-and-trade method. In the raw material procurement and logistics, the carbon emission is caused during the ordering, transporting and holding the procured items from various suppliers. The paper aims to model sustainability-resilience link at the supply chain design level through the procurement and logistics of raw material which is considered as the primary stage of any supply chain. A dynamic non-linear mixed integer model featuring an environmental sustainability through cap-and-trade method of carbon emission is proposed that can be used to design sustainable procurement logistics for disaster resilient supply chain management. The proposed model in the paper is referred as SPL_DRSCM (sustainable procurement and logistics for disaster resilient supply chain management) and is validated through illustrations. Important useful managerial and practical insights are obtained from set of five different deterministic data sets. Proposed model for SPL_DRSCM MINLP shows significant cost saving while optimizing procurement and its logistics under carbon emission constraint. Comparative analysis is conducted and detailed numerical results are presented.",Sustainable procurement and logistics for disaster resilient supply chain,Sustainable procurement *** Sustainable logistics *** Lot-sizing *** Supplier selection *** Carrier selection *** Mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) *** Sustainable procurement and logistics for disaster resilient supply chainmanagement (SPL_DRSCM),annals of operations research,WOS:000505588800015,2019,,,,,,
"This paper addresses the problem of biomass with agricultural waste-to-energy network design under uncertainty. We propose a novel data-driven Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization model for hedging against uncertainty in the optimal network design. Instead of assuming perfect knowledge of probability distribution for uncertain parameters, we construct a data-driven ambiguity set of candidate distributions based on the Wasserstein metric, which is utilized to quantify their distances from the data-based empirical distribution. Equipped with this ambiguity set, the two-stage distributionally robust optimization model not only accommodates the sequential decision making at design and operational stages, but also hedges against the distributional ambiguity arising from finite amount of uncertainty data. A solution algorithm is further developed to solve the resulting two-stage distributionally robust mixed-integer nonlinear program. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we present a case study of a biomass with agricultural waste-to-energy network including 216 technologies and 172 compounds. Computational results show that the data-driven Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization approach has a better out-of-sample performance in terms of a 5.7% lower average cost and a 37.1% smaller cost standard deviation compared with the conventional stochastic programming method.",Data-driven Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization for biomass with agricultural waste-to-energy network design under uncertainty,Biomass conversion *** Data-driven decision making *** Distributionally robust optimization *** Waste-to-energy *** Wasserstein metric,applied energy,WOS:000497978100095,2019,,,,,,
"Supply chains are becoming increasingly dynamic in response to changing business environments and technology. This has created challenges in managing the flow of materials and created greater risk of disruption. As such this study investigates the impact of such dynamism on disruption orientations, resilience, and financial performance. Herein an integrated conceptual framework is developed and then tested using survey data from a cross section of 241 Chinese companies and structural equation modelling. The results of the study reveal that supply chain dynamism has a significant positive effect on supply chain disruption orientation and supply chain resilience.

"The air pollution of conventional fuels, increases the tendency to alternative cleaner fuels like biodiesel fuels. Biodiesel is an expensive fuel and can be used as an additive to reduce levels of particulates, carbon monoxide, and other pollutants released from diesel fuel. The proportion of biodiesel in the produced fuel can be planned and controlled according to the conditions. This study forms a comprehensive multi-objective-period model for designing a biodiesel development program and compares different biodiesel blends and primary resources. The study considers B5, B10, B20, B40, and B100 along with diesel as the candidate fuels for demand fulfillment; furthermore, model considers waste cooking oil, soya, sunflower, and rapeseed as the primary resources. The objectives are the facilities' implementation costs and environmental effects minimization. The decision variables are the capacity planning and the facility location variables. The exact Pareto set is obtained by using the augmented e-constraint method. The study considers economic and environment objectives interactions.

"According to the high sugar and oil content of algae, the algal biofuel have been taken into consideration in recent years. This paper develops a multi-objective mixed integer quadratic programming (MMIQP) model to optimize the design and planning of an algae-based biofuel supply chain network under environmental and economic objectives. The goals of this paper are set to maximize the total profit and carbon dioxide absorption of the supply chain. The proposed mathematical model considers the deterioration issue in the inventory and during the transportation, in a multi-period time horizon. Since the alternative fuel price is not certain in the real world, a two-stage stochastic programming is utilized to address this uncertainty. Moreover, data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach is proposed to rank the candidate cities based on efficiency for microalgal harvesting. The applicability and efficiency of the proposed model are finally demonstrated through a real case study in Iran. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

"This study aims to provide a new approach to the design of a closed-loop supply chain network by emphasizing the impact. of the government's environmental policies based on a bi-level mixed integer linear programming model. Government is considered as the leader at the first level and tends to set a collection rate policy, which leads to collecting more used products in order to ensure a minimum distribution ratio to satisfy minimum demands. At the second level, the private sector is considered as a follower and tries to maximize its profit by designing its own closed-loop supply chain network according to the government's used products collection policy. A heuristic algorithm and an adaptive genetic algorithm based on the enumeration method are proposed, and their performances are evaluated through computational experiences. The comparison among numerical examples reveals that there is an obvious conflict between the government. and CLSC goals. Moreover, it shows that this conflict should be considered and elaborated in uncertain environment by applying the min-max regret scenario based robust optimization approach. The results show the necessity of applying robust bi-level programming to the closed-loop supply chain network design under the governmental legislative decisions as a leader-follower configuration.

"The sustainable third-party reverse logistics provider (3PRLP) selection, as the core of sustainable supply chain management, has become paramount in research nowadays. In the actual evaluation process, the decision makers may hesitate in a few linguistic terms and have different partiality towards each term, hence the possibility distribution based hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (PDHFLTSs), as expressed by a consecutive or non-consecutive linguistic term set, is suitable for such an evaluation. The purpose of this paper is to solve sustainable 3PRLP selection problems with linguistic information by developing an effective and robust method. We firstly redefine the covariance-based correlation coefficient that can simplify the computation to calculate the consensus degree, and then introduce the hesitant degree in context of possibility distribution information, in order to enrich measures of PDHFLTSs. On this basis, the weights of experts are computed for expression aggregation. Secondly, to overcome attributes' weights staying constant, the combination of group utility function and variable weight approach is introduced to give the weights of attributes. Most importantly, a decision method, called MULTIMOORA, is optimized by improving the ranking position method, and then, through the combination with PDHFLTS, we proposed a possibility distribution based hesitant fuzzy linguistic MULTIMOORA method with great robustness. At last, the presented method is applied to the field of sustainable third-party reverse logistics provider selection in the e-commerce express industry and the effectiveness is verified by several comparative analyses.",A MAGDM Method Based on Possibility Distribution Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Set and Its Application,sustainable 3PRLP selection *** possibility distribution based hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set *** MULTIMOORA method *** expert weights *** variable weight theory *** improved ranking position method,mathematics,WOS:000502288700060,2019,,,,,,
"Escalating global food security concerns across several nations has shifted the focus of policy makers towards risk adaptive sustainable food grain operations. This paper builds a sustainable food grain transportation model for intermodal transportation operations between two Indian states, in the presence of hub disruption. A hub and spoke system is used to connect origin and destination warehouses through intermodal hubs in a multi-layered network. The problem is formulated as a multi-period mixed integer nonlinear single objective optimization problem considering minimization of transportation, hub location, rerouting, environmental and social costs with near optimal shipment quantities and hub allocations as the prime decisions. The proposed MINLP is solved using Particle Swarm Optimization with Differential Evolution (PSODE), a superior metaheuristic to deal with NP-hard problems. Convergence graphs and global optimal costs are reported for small, medium and large size instances consisting of 1824, 9768 and 28848 variables respectively, inspired from food grain industry in the southern part of India. Pareto plots are generated to capture the complementarity between economical and socio-environmental cost categories for all instances. The effect of hub location, hub disruption, cost consolidation and vehicle resource availability factors on individual and total costs is studied through sensitivity analysis. Results indicate that food grain demand is fulfilled with 14% increase in the mean total cost for single hub disruption case and with 40% increase for multiple hub disruption. Finally, managerial implications provide specific factor level recommendations for different strategic objectives.",Modelling and analysis of intermodal food grain transportation under hub disruption towards sustainability,Intermodal transportation *** Food grain shipment *** Disruption *** Particle swarm optimization with differential *** evolution *** Sustainability,international journal of production economics,WOS:000498330400022,2019,,,,,,

"Managing supply chain operations in a reliable manner is a significant concern for decision-makers in competitive industries. In this article, two mathematical models considering competition and integrity in a three-echelon supply chain under uncertainty are proposed. The competition is formulated as a Stackelberg game such that the distribution centers have more power than the retailers. In the first model, decisions are made about the location and number of distribution centers (DCs), allocation of retailers, and the selling price of products. In the second model, based on the real world, the probability of risk and failure for the distribution centers are considered. Backup facilities should be established for unreliable facilities to meet the demands of retailers during disruption. To capture uncertainty, a two-stage stochastic approach is applied to model the problems. The first stage of the model belongs to the strategic planning and is not affected by randomness, while the second stage deals with tactical decisions depending on the realization of the first stage's random vector. In order to solve the problem, a hybrid genetic algorithm has been applied to large-scale problems. Numerical experiments have been conducted to assess the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Next, a sensitivity analysis is performed to recognize the most important parameters and evaluate the accuracy of our approach. Finally, to demonstrate the applicability of the model, the proposed model was implemented on the data of Alborz Pharmaceutical Company. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It is necessary to explore the relationships among the sustainability influencing factors of rural last mile delivery. A total of 15 sustainability influencing factors are selected. The improved fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) is used to assign the weights of the factors and then the interpretative structural model (ISM) is used to determine the hierarchical structure of each factor. The driving force-dependency quadrant graph is constructed by cross-impact matrix multiplication (MICMAC). The research results show that four factors, including convenience of returning goods, integrity of goods, advance reservation of goods pickup, and delivery costs, are the most basic factors affecting the sustainability of rural last mile delivery and are the deepest and most indispensable factors. This research provides valuable information for decision makers to develop proactive strategies and reinforcement policies to improve the service quality of rural last mile delivery, which could promote the sustainable development of rural logistics.","Using the FAHP, ISM, and MICMAC Approaches to Study the Sustainability Influencing Factors of the Last Mile Delivery of Rural E-Commerce Logistics",rural e-commerce logistics *** last mile delivery *** sustainability influencing factors *** fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) *** interpretative structural modeling (ISM) *** cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC),sustainability,WOS:000482261800181,2019,,,,,,
"Purpose Growth in a number of the supply chain (SC) disruptions threatens the enterprises globally. Earlier studies and reports say that many organizations go out of businesses within two or three years after they experience a major disruption. Therefore, companies in today's volatile business arena need to possess the necessary resilience level to combat supply china disruptions. This is even more important for organizations of developing nations, which are constantly struggling to gain the advantages of globalization and to grab the new opportunities. Thus, this paper aims to help organizations understand their SC resilience level through a framework. Design/methodology/approach The methodology comprises integrated Delphi - fuzzy logic approach in identifying formative elements of SC resilience from a diverse resilience related body of knowledge and distinguish key obstacles of SC resilience based on their performance level. Findings Findings reveal that SC flexibility components such as sourcing, manufacturing and logistic flexibility are the major contributors of SC resilience index of case organization. Similarly, lack of risk management culture, inter-organizational relationships, information sharing and integration of SC stakeholders are the major inhibitors of resilience. Thus, the organization needs to overcome these identified obstacles to enhance their SC resilience level. Practical implications - Present study offers a novel focus of research on SC resilience measurement that is significant for understanding the level of immunity enterprises possess to unanticipated SC interruptions, and the ability to bounce back after an unforeseen event. Originality/value This paper proposes an integrated Delphi - fuzzy logic framework for measuring SC resilience. In doing so, the study identifies key potential inhibitors of SC resilience of the case company under study.",An integrated Delphi - fuzzy logic approach for measuring supply chain resilience: an illustrative case from manufacturing industry,Supply chain *** Resilience *** Risk management *** Measurement *** Resilience management *** Supply chain disruptions *** India,measuring business excellence,WOS:000490292500008,2019,,,,,,
"Recently, social awareness, governmental legislations and competitive business environment have spurred researchers to pay much attention to closed-loop supply chain network design. In order to support the arising trend, this paper presents a comprehensive mathematical model for a multi-period, multi-product, multi-modal and bi-objective green closed-loop supply chain. The objective of the model is to minimize the total cost and environmental emissions through making the best decisions on facility location, transportation amounts and inventory balances. According to the inherent complexity of the problem and considering multi-product, multi-period and multi-modality assumptions makes it hard to handle, and as for the solution approach, an effective accelerated benders decomposition algorithm is implemented. Then, computational results for a set of numerical example are discussed. Besides, the model and solution approach are applied on a wire-and-cable industry. Then, a sensitivity analysis is implemented in an effort to validate the model. Results reveal applicability of the proposed mathematical model and presented solution approach. Following the obtained results, it can be validly concluded that the suggested solution approach leads to more than 13 percent reduction in total cost for the studied case, and can be even employed for larger and more complex real-world industrial applications.

"Purpose In recent years, governmental regulations and the pressure of non-governmental organizations have convinced corporations to consider sustainable issues in their decisions. A simultaneous design of forward and reverse logistics can keep us away from sub-optimality caused by tackling these two phases (forward and reverse logistics) separately. Design/methodology/approach Hence, this paper presents a new multi-objective mathematical model for integrated forward and reverse logistics regarding economic, environmental and social issues. A new hybrid multi-objective metaheuristic algorithm is developed to obtain a set of efficient solutions (Pareto solutions). The proposed algorithm hybridizes a well-known, non-dominated genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) with a simulated annealing algorithm. Findings To validate the algorithm, its results are compared to the obtained solutions from simple NSGA-II with respect to some comparison metrics. The numerical results show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Finally, concluding remarks and future research directions are provided.

"In the past few decades, it has been widely observed that environmental awareness is continuously increasing among people, stakeholders, and governments. However, rigorous environmental rules and policies pushed organizations to accept affirmative changes like green supply chain management practices in their processes of the supply chain. Selection of green supplier is a tedious task and comprises a lot of challenges starting from evaluation to their final selection, which is experienced by supplier management professionals. The development and implementation of practical decision-making tools that seek to address these challenges are rapidly evolving. In the present work, the evaluation of a set of suppliers is primarily based on both conventional and environmental criteria. This work proposes a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) based framework that is used to evaluate green supplier selection by using an integrated fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) with the other three techniques namely MABAC (Multi-Attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison), WASPAS (Weighted Aggregated Sum-Product Assessment) and TOPSIS (Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal Solution). Initially, six green supplier selection environmental criteria (Environmental management system, green image, staff environment training, eco-design, pollution control, and resource consumption) and three conventional criteria (price, quality and service level) have been identified through literature review and expert's opinions to employ MCDM approach. A real-world case study of the automotive industry in India is deliberated to exhibit the proposed framework applicability. From AHP findings, 'Environment management system', 'Pollution control', 'Quality', and 'Green image' have been ranked as the topmost four green supplier selection criteria. Besides, the consistency test was performed to check the uniformity of the expert's input whereas the 'robustness' of the approach was tested by performing sensitivity analysis. The results illustrate that the applied fuzzy hybrid methods reach common green supplier rankings. Moreover, out of the four green supplier's alternatives, supplier number 'one' got the highest rank. This shows that the applied models are robust in nature. Further, this study relinquishes a single platform for the selection of green supplier under fuzzy environment. The applied methodology and its analysis will provide insight to decision-makers of supplier selection. It may aid decision-makers and the procurement department not only to differentiate the significant green supplier selection criteria but also to assess the most efficient green supplier in the supply chain in the global market.",Green supplier selection using multi-criterion decision making under fuzzy environment: A case study in automotive industry,ARP *** TOPSIS *** MABAC *** WASPAS *** Fuzzy set theory *** Consistency test *** Sensitivity analysis,computers & industrial engineering,WOS:000494891000050,2019,,,,,,
"Improving the performance and economic sustainability of agricultural producers requires the integration of many dimensions, one of which is logistics. Establishing efficient and cost-effective transportation is a key element of establishing sustainable linkages along food supply chains between farmers, storage and transport companies, and consumers. In this regard, infrastructural constraints to sustainability in agricultural production exacerbate transportation costs and risks, and thus result in lower performance of agricultural producers. As fuel consumption is, first, the most significant cost in agricultural logistics and, second, particularly sensitive to disruptions of transport, loading, and storage infrastructure, management of fuel costs is crucial to assure profit margin of an agricultural enterprise. By transforming the standard economic order quantity (EOQ) model, the authors attempt to build an approach to the optimization of fuel costs. The analysis made in the cases of twelve large crop farms in three territories of Southern Russia allowed the consideration of: (1) fragmentation in storage infrastructure; (2) variations in fuel consumption depending on the vehicle load ratio; (3) the use of their own fleet of vehicles against the outsourcing of transport operations. The authors find that the tactics of optimization of fuel costs vary depending on the location of a farm in relation to grain storage facilities. Particularly, the farms located in areas of high concentration of storage facilities benefit from using their own fleet of vehicles, while those experiencing longer distances of transportation should outsource the performance of logistics operations to third parties. To overcome a site-specific nature, the transformed EOQ model should accommodate country-specific requirements, specifically, the level of fragmentation of transport and storage infrastructure, average distance of transportation from a farm to receival site, and average fuel consumption rates depending on the types of trucks commonly used by farmers. The key recommendation is that sustainability-aimed management of logistics costs should consider combining the operation of trucks by a farm with the outsourcing of transportation operations to address the fragmentation of transport and storage infrastructure.",Dynamic Optimization of Fuel and Logistics Costs as a Tool in Pursuing Economic Sustainability of a Farm,agriculture *** cost *** dynamic optimization *** fuel *** logistics *** transportation,sustainability,WOS:000493525500322,2019,,,,,,
"In operations research, bi-level programming is a mathematical modeling which has another optimization problem as a constraint. In the present research, regarding the current intense competition among large manufacturing companies for achieving a greater market share, a bi-level robust optimization model is developed as a leader-follower problem using Stackelberg game in the field of Aggregate Production Planning (APP). The leader company with higher influence intended to produce new products, which could replace the existing products. The follower companies, as rivals, were also seeking more sales, but they did not have the intention and ability to produce such new products. The price of the new products was determined by the presented elasticity relations between uncertain demand and price. After linearization, using the KKT conditions, the bi-level robust model was transformed into an ordinary uni-level model. Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, Benders Decomposition Algorithm (BDA) was proposed for overcoming the computational complexities in large scale. Finally, using the real data of Sarvestan Sepahan Co as a leader company, the validity of the developed model as well as efficiency and convergence of the BDA was investigated. The computational results clearly showed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed BDA. (C) 2019 Sharif University of Technology.

"Recent advances in the product packaging materials have enabled the supply chain management systems to adopt returnable transport packaging policies to achieve economic and environmental sustainability. The application of the advanced self-healing polymers in packaging material has enabled the packaging to withstand fatigue associated failures with the increased mechanical strength. In this perspective, this paper develops a multi-attribute closed-loop supply chain model for self-healing polymers based returnable transport packaging with single supplier, single manufacturer, and multi-retailers under budget and storage constraints. A single-setup-multi-delivery (SSMD) policy is recommended for the centralized decision making of the supplier and manufacturer in a proposed supply chain management to improve the economic sustainability. To depict the real world situations for environmental protection, the effect of the variable aspects of transportation and carbon emissions are minimized through the optimal production delivery strategies. Multi-objectives of the proposed supply chain model include profit maximization and carbon emissions minimization of the system. A weighted goal programming technique along with three distinct metaheuristic approaches are applied to obtain the efficient trade-off among model objectives. The experimental analysis is carried out to illustrate the practical implication of the proposed supply chain management model and numerical results are analyzed for their robustness. The experimental outcomes for the application of SSMD policy are compared with single-setup-singledelivery (SSSD) policy, which proves that the SSMD policy improves the total profit of the whole system by devising the optimal number of shipments. The sensitivity analysis is carried out to study the behavior of the key parameters involved in the proposed supply chain management for varying decision maker preferences and significant managerial insights are obtained.",Optimal production delivery policies for supplier and manufacturer in a constrained closed-loop supply chain for returnable transport packaging through metaheuristic approach,Self-healing packaging *** Returnable transport packaging *** Closed-loop supply chain *** Single-setup-multi-delivery policy *** Variable transportation *** Variable carbon emission,computers & industrial engineering,WOS:000482244100074,2019,,,,,,
"Nowadays, sustainability has gained much attention from economists, environmentalists, consumers, industrialists, government and the academia. The regulatory policies for carbon emissions force the firms to redesign its supply chain. In this paper, different production-distribution and inventory problems in multi-echelon supply chain were critically investigated with three carbon policies (carbon tax, strict carbon capping and carbon cap-and-trade) and lead-time considerations. Then, a non-linear mixed-integer programming based mathematical model has been developed and tested with the proposed heuristic.

"Palm Oil is a highly successful flex crop that has become a development engine in Southeast Asia and elsewhere. If the industry-led stakeholder initiative, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) is to be believed, there is also a mechanism in place that can guarantee sustainable production along the supply chain. But what counts as sustainable and what does this mean on the ground in producing countries like Malaysia and Indonesia? This article argues that the form of sustainability offered by certification schemes such as the RSPO fetishes the commodity palm oil in order to assuage critical consumer initiatives in the North. This technical-managerial solution is part of a larger project: the post political climate politics regime (Swyngedouw) that attempts to green the status quo. But certification obscures the problem that it is not the commodity itself but the social relations of nature in the production of the commodity that need to become sustainable. It will be shown that despite certification, these social relations of nature are contested in Southeast Asia. Social and political struggles over land rights, workers' rights and environmental justice are repoliticising debates over palm oil, opening up trajectories of eco-social transformation that make alternative sustainability futures for palm oil possible.

"This article aims to propose a methodological framework to determine the degree of the dynamic impact of the effect of activities in the field of sustainable waste logistics on the development of trade in recyclable raw materials in the chosen countries of the European Union, especially in Poland and Hungary. In order to determine the dynamic interdependence between the indicated phenomena, econometric tools associated with the vector autoregression model were used, namely: Granger causality tests, impulse response function and variance decomposition of forecast errors. The tools used will not only identify the direction of the causal interdependence between the effects of sustainable logistics activities and the development of trade in recyclable raw materials, but also allow to determine the strength of the interaction between these variables. The conducted research shows that changes in the environmental effects of waste logistics activities are the Granger cause of changes occurring in the trade of renewable raw materials, especially in Hungary. Considering adequately delayed values of the synthetic development measure of the environmental effects of waste logistics increases the accuracy of predictions for changes in the trade of recyclable raw materials.",Sustainable Waste Logistics and the Development of Trade in Recyclable Raw Materials in Poland and Hungary,recyclable raw materials management *** sustainability *** waste logistics *** waste management,sustainability,WOS:000485230200164,2019,,,,,,
"This paper presents a bi-objective robust optimization model for the integrated production and distribution planning of a supply chain with the postponement strategy. The two objectives are economic (cost minimization) and environmental (greenhouse gas emissions minimization), respectively. The robust model is capable of incorporating decision makers' risk attitudes in addressing demand uncertainties under conditions of very limited historical data. The application of the proposed approach is examined using real data of an actual pharmaceutical supply chain as well as a benchmark problem in the existing literature. Our analysis and investigation focuses on exploring the extent to which the tradeoffs between economic and environmental objectives are influenced by the decision makers' risk preferences and postponement strategy. We find that independent of the amount of greenhouse gas emissions and degree of demand variability, the postponement strategy can consistently provide cost savings for the supply chain.",A robust optimization model for efficient and green supply chain planning with postponement strategy,Supply chain *** Production-distribution planning *** Postponement strategy *** Robust optimization *** Sustainability *** Uncertainty *** Multi-objective programming,international journal of production economics,WOS:000474324300020,2019,,,,,,
"Under the background of the development of construction waste recycling in China, optimizing the site of construction waste recycling and disposal plant is important, considering not only the cost of construction waste recycling but also the impact on the surrounding environment. This study aims to minimize the cost and negative environmental effects. In order to find the best method to solve the problem of multiobjective function optimization, we propose a multiobjective location model which combines genetic algorithm with probabilistic robust optimization. The model first uses genetic algorithm to get preliminary result and then it uses probabilistic robust optimization to find the optimal solution. The preliminary results show that 1, 3, 5 of the candidate sites more cost-effective and environmentally friendly than other. The fitness value converges at a stable value of 1.55 x 10(-5), and the Pareto optimal frontier presents considerable clustering characteristics, which prove the rationality and operability of the site selection optimization model. Meanwhile, the robust model analysis under the given uncertain environment achieves the purpose of further optimization of the site. The research results can provide the government with a theoretical basis for the site selection of construction and demolition waste recycling plants. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

"Increasing demand of automotive products and over-consumption of natural resources compel the manufacturers to implement the Extension of Useful Life (EUL) methodology of automotive products through remanufacturing. Remanufacturing is a process in which the original functionality of End-of-Use (EoU) or End-of-Life (EoL) product is restored and the remanufactured product is treated as good as a new product. In spite of these advantages, remanufacturing is still not so popular and organized in developing countries like India. The developing countries encounter several problems in strategic, tactical and operational level of management while implementing the remanufacturing business option. In this paper attempts have been made to identify both the enablers and the barriers in managing business of EUL products through remanufacturing in India. Subsequently the structural relationships among the enablers and barriers have been modelled in this paper. Initially an extensive literature review is carried out to identify the factors depicting the enablers and barriers. Then, Fuzzy Interpretive Structural Modeling (FISM) is applied to develop and evaluate the structural relationships among the identified factors. The application of FISM helps in understanding the effect of major enablers and barriers in extending useful life of automotive products through remanufacturing. The outcome of FISM based analysis shows that low cost, price sensitive market, cheap labour cost, and fast turnaround are the major enablers for OEM in initiating EUL business practice through remanufacturing, whereas the major barriers are lack of proper design of product, stringent foreign trade policy, cannibalization of new product, lack of proper remarketing strategies, lack of reverse network design, lack of proper maintaining the database of the customers, seller reputation and identity. The analysis is further enriched by MICMAC technique, which leads to getting an insight on the significance of the dependence and driving power of both the enablers and barriers.

Eliminating unnecessary healthcare waste in hospitals and providing better healthcare quality are the core issues of green supply chain management (GSCM). Hence, this study used a hospital’s emergency department crowding (EDC) problem to illustrate how to establish an emergency medicine service (EMS) simulation system to obtain a robust parameters setting for solving hospitals’ EDC and waste problems, thereby increasing healthcare quality. Inappropriate resource allocation results in more serious EDC; more serious EDC results in increasing operating costs. Therefore, in the healthcare system, waste includes inappropriate costs and inappropriate resource allocation. The EMS of a medical center in central Taiwan was the object of the study. In this study, the dynamic Taguchi method was used to set the signal factor, noise factor, and control factors to simulate the EMS system to obtain the optimal parameters setting. The performance was set to Emergency Department Work Index (EDWINC) and system time (waiting time and service time) per patient. The signal factor was set to the number of physicians; the noise factor was set to patient arrival rate; the control factors included persuading Triage 4 and Triage 5 outpatients, checkup process, bed occupation rate in the emergency department (ED), and medical checkup sequence for Triage 4 and Triage 5 patients. This study makes two significant contributions. First, the study introduces the GSCM concept to the healthcare setting to bring green innovation to hospitals. Hospital administrators may hence design better GSCM activities to facilitate healthcare processes to provide better healthcare outcomes. Second, the study applied the dynamic Taguchi method to the EMS and neural network (NN) to construct a computational model revealing the cause (factors) and effect (performances) relationship. In addition, the genetic algorithm (GA), a solution method, was used to obtain the optimal parameters setting of the EDC in Taiwan. Hence, after obtaining the solutions, the unnecessary waste in EDC—inappropriate costs and inappropriate resource allocation—is reduced.",The application of GSCM in eliminating healthcare waste: Hospital EDC as an example,Dynamic Taguchi method *** Emergency department crowding (EDC) *** Emergency medicine service (EMS) *** Genetic algorithm (GA) *** Green supply chain management (GSCM) *** Neural network (NN),international journal of environmental research and public health,85074167932,2019,,,,,,

"© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature. One of the key issues in supply chain sustainability is the efficient usage of the available resources. At the same time, proactive supply chain design with disruption risk considerations frequently leads to a network redundancy which implies some resource reservations in anticipation of possible disruptions. Even if resilient supply chain design has received much attention in literature, there is a research gap in designing both resilient and sustainable supply chains. This study contributes to closing the given gap by proposing a novel methodological approach to modelling network redundancy optimization. This allows for simultaneous computation of both optimal network redundancy and proactive contingency plans, considering both supply dynamics and structural disruption risks. The novelties of this study are the integration of sustainable resource utilization and SC resilience based on coordination of structure- and flow-oriented optimization. The model uncovers a practical approach to analyze and optimize supply chain redundancy by varying processing intensities of resource consumption in the network according to supply and structural dynamics. This makes it possible to explicitly include the dynamics of resource consumption for contingency plan realization in disruption scenarios.",Optimization of network redundancy and contingency planning in sustainable and resilient supply chain resource management under conditions of structural dynamics,Decomposition *** Linear programming *** Logistics network *** Optimization *** Risk management *** Supply chain *** Sustainability,annals of operations research,85062732569,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 Jiguang Wang and Yucai Wu. Today's business environment is complex, dynamic, and uncertain which makes a supply chain facility increasingly vulnerable to disruption from various risk accidents as one of the main threats to the whole supply chain's operation. However, in general, most of the studies on facility location problems assume that the facilities, once built, will always run availably and reliably. In fact, although the probability is very low, supply chain disruptions often incur disastrous consequences. Therefore, it is critical to account for disruptions during designing supply chain networks. To accomplish planned outcomes and greater supply chain resiliency, this article proposes a continuous approximation approach based on regular hexagon partition to address the reliable facility location problems with consideration of facility disruptions risk. The optimization goal is to determine the best facility location that minimizes the expected total system cost on the premise that the supply chain network is not disrupted as a whole when one or some facilities are subject to probabilistic failure. Our numerical experiment discusses the performance of the proposed solution approaches which demonstrates that the benefits of considering disruptions in the supply chain design can be significant. In addition, considering the impact of disruption probability estimation error on the optimal decision, the misestimating of the disruption probability is also investigated in this paper.",A Continuous Approximation Approach Based on Regular Hexagon Partition for the Facility Location Problem under Disruptions Risk, ,complexity,85062340654,2019,,,,,,

"© 2019 by the authors. In today's complex market competition environment, a high quality and high level of service plays a critical role in obtaining and maintaining long-term sustainable competitive advantage for enterprises and supply chains. Considering the service negative spillover effect, this paper investigates the horizontal Stackelberg competition and optimal service decision in two competing manufacturer-led supply chains. Four competitive structure models are constructed and the corresponding equilibrium solutions are obtained. By comparing the equilibrium results of four different structures, it is found that the service negative spillover effect and competition between supply chains have negative incentive effect on service providers and their supply chains. However, the chain-to-chain competition will benefit the supply chain that does not provide services from free-riding effect, which will be intensified with the intensification of competition. In addition, from the perspective of supply chain network and externality, we find that when the structure of one supply chain remains fixed and the other changes from centralized to decentralized, there will be a ""double marginalization"" effect.

Given the current food supply chain (SC) situations that generates substantial amount of wastes and emissions (CO2e) starting from input supply point to the marketing; increasing demand for food for growing population, requirements of water, and energy for processing the food, it is not sustainable. In addition, it is exposed to natural calamity and risks from supply, production and quality system failures and other disruptions and disasters. As such a sustainable food SC network design model is proposed that integrates resilience criteria, lean, and green based practices to overcome limitations of the current practices of the chain and improve its performances. The research designs and plans sustainable food collection regional grids, their potential locations, capacities, operations, establishment of relationship with food processing centers, and big-name retailers. The model is defined as a deterministic model to improve sustainability performance of a grid based supply chain network. Each grid is run by food collection cooperatives formed by the local farmers or small business organization. The research contributes by designing and planning potential grid locations, their capacities and integrates resilience criteria and lean based practices for improving sustainability performances. Applicability of the model is illustrated by the grid network of an example region (state).","Integrating lean, green, and resilience criteria in a sustainable food supply chain planning model",Food collection cooperatives *** Lean and green criteria *** Regional supply chain grids *** Resilience criteria *** Sustainable food supply chain,"international journal of mathematical, engineering and management sciences",85061796762,2019,,,,,,

We develop a generalized Benders decomposition-based approach to solve the models. Problems representing a variety of scenarios that simulates different economic environments are solved. Our computational results show that the product costing method could influence the concentration of production activities at potential manufacturing locations, production and shipment quantities, product prices, and allocation of profits in the supply chain.",Product costing in the strategic formation of a supply chain,Capacity planning *** Decision support models *** Operations management *** Pricing *** Supply chain management *** Supply disruption,annals of operations research,85015696970,2019,,,,,,
"© The Author(s) 2019. Blood is a perishable, scarce and lifesaving product. While the demand for blood products has been increased over the past few decades, there has been no specified artificial alternative for this critical product yet. In this context, it is of paramount importance to design efficient, agile and effective blood supply chain networks. This paper presents a multi-objective stochastic programming model for blood supply chain network design by considering the following objectives: minimising total cost, minimising delivery time and maximising two important social measures including the indicator of consumer's health and the rate of regular blood donors. A robust optimisation approach is employed to incorporate different sources of uncertainties in demand and supply parameters. To investigate the performance and utility of the proposed formulation, the model is implemented using real data of blood transfusion network of Tehran.",A robust optimisation model for sustainable blood supply chain network design under uncertainty,Blood supply chain *** Network design *** Sustainability *** Uncertainty *** ε-constraint method,international journal of industrial and systems engineering,85065089119,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 Kharazmi University. All rights reserved. This paper aims to propose a multi-period multi-product supply chain network design which takes the sustainability dimensions into consideration in both strategic and operational decisions. Several critical issues in planning of supply chain networks are considered in the model such as the capacity of facilities, the minimum acceptable rate for the social score of manufacturing plants and distribution centers, the maximum coverage radius, and the limited budget. In order to obtain an effective and efficient network design, different categories of uncertainty are also taken into account, including the provider-side uncertainty reflected in the capacity of constructed facilities, as well as the economic, environmental, social, and technical parameters, the receiver-side uncertainty reflected in the demand, and the in-between uncertainty reflected in the transportation cost and the maximum coverage radius. To deal with different sources of uncertainty in the concerned problem, a chance constrained fuzzy programming approach is employed. Several test problems are used to analyze the characteristics of the proposed problem. The computational results can help decision makers to design supply chain networks from economic, environmental, and social perspectives.",A chance-constrained fuzzy programming approach for a sustainable supply chain network design under multiple sources of uncertainty,Chance constraint fuzzy programming *** Coverage radius *** Network design *** Supply chain management *** Sustainability *** Uncertainty,international journal of supply and operations management,85082965578,2019,,,,,,
"© 2013 IEEE. This paper investigates the multi-period and multi-echelon spare parts supply optimization problem. The periodic review order-up-to-S inventory policy is considered to determine the supply timing and the spare parts consumption. The spare parts consumption in lead time of each customer is calculated by the process of spare parts supply. A dynamic optimization mathematical model is developed to find the optimal supply scheme in each period with the objective of minimum total costs. In the dynamic optimization model, the parameters are changed with time. An improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to solve this dynamic problem. In the proposed algorithm, a change detector and a change response strategy are used to handle the change of optimization environment. We also adopt a self-adaption neighborhood search strategy to improve the ability of exploration and exploitation of the algorithm. Numerical experiment shows that the proposed strategy can improve the performance of algorithm greatly, and the model and solution method in this paper can be applied to optimize the spare parts supply in various scenarios.","Improved dynamic PSO-Based algorithm for critical spare parts supply optimization under (T, S) inventory policy",dynamic optimization *** inventory policy *** particle swarm optimization *** Spare parts *** supply network optimization,ieee access,85077820251,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 by the authors. This study develops an integrated production-inventory model for a two-echelon supply chain network with controllable probabilistic deterioration. The investment in preservation technology is considered a decision variable to control the deteriorated quantity of an integrated system. The objective of the study is to optimize preservation investment, the number of shipments and shipment quantity, so that the total cost per unit of time of the supply chain is minimized. The study proposes a solution method, and the results show that investment in preservation technology reduces the total supply chain cost by 13%. Additionally, preservation increases the lot size, thus increasing the production cycle length, which reduces the ordering cost of the system. Furthermore, this study shows that preservation leads to a reduction of solid waste from deteriorated products. Total deteriorated products reduced to 8 units from 235 units, hence, preservation generates positive environmental benefits along with economic impacts. The robustness of the proposed model is illustrated with a numerical example, sensitivity analysis, and graphical representations. Moreover, comparative study and managerial insights are given to extract significant insights from the model.",Effects of preservation technology investment on waste generation in a two-echelon supply chain model,Controllable probabilistic deterioration rate *** Preservation technology investment *** Refrigerated trucks *** Supply chain management *** Waste reduction,mathematics,85066844616,2019,,,,,,
"© 2018 John Wiley  &  Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment The evaluation and selection of strategies for sustainable development in manufacturing supply chains are critical tasks for the decision-maker because of the complexity involving various criteria. This paper deals with the prioritization of critical sustainability criteria and the sustainability strategy selection (SSS) using an integrated weighting approach. This approach consists of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), the subjective and objective weight integrated approach (SOWIA) and the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) and is found to be effective for solving this multi-criteria decision-making problem. The proposed methodology is applied to solve a real-time supply chain decision-making issue of an Indian manufacturing industry. From a sustainability perspective, the results indicate the second strategy set as the best among the given alternatives, with an objective factor of 0.5. The robustness of the results has been analysed to identify the uncertainty in the final ranking. The consistency of the final ranking has been evaluated based on different objective factor values. The novelty of this paper pertains to addressing the most relevant SSS problem involved in a manufacturing supply chain and in establishing a hybrid approach for solving it. This approach offers a flexible provision for decision-makers to incorporate the appropriate level of subjectivity and objectivity into their decisions based on their degree of expertise.

"Copyright © 2019 Zeaki, Johler, Skandamis and Schelin. Agricultural University of Athens, Athens, Greece Prevention, prediction, control, and handling of bacterial foodborne diseases - an ongoing, serious, and costly concern worldwide - are continually facing a wide array of difficulties. Not the least due to that food matrices, highly variable and complex, can impact virulence expression in diverse and unpredictable ways. This review aims to present a comprehensive overview of challenges related to the presence of enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus aureus in the food production chain. It focuses on characteristics, expression, and regulation of the highly stable staphylococcal enterotoxins and in particular staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA). Together with the robustness of the pathogen under diverse environmental conditions and the range of possible entry routes into the food chain, this poses some of the biggest challenges in the control of SFP. Furthermore, the emergence of new enterotoxins, found to be connected with SFP, brings new questions around their regulatory mechanisms and expression in different food environments. The appearance of increasing amounts of antibiotic resistant strains found in food is also highlighted. Finally, potentials and limitations of implementing existing risk assessment models are discussed. Various quantitative microbial risk assessment approaches have attempted to quantify the growth of the bacterium and production of disease causing levels of toxin under various food chain and domestic food handling scenarios. This requires employment of predictive modeling tools, quantifying the spatiotemporal population dynamics of S. aureus in response to intrinsic and extrinsic food properties. In this context, the armory of predictive modeling employs both kinetic and probabilistic models to estimate the levels that potentiate toxin production, the time needed to reach that levels, and overall, the likelihood of toxin production. Following risk assessment, the main challenge to mitigate the risk of S. aureus intoxication is first to prevent growth of the organism and then to hamper the production of enterotoxins, or at least prevent the accumulation of high levels (e.g., >10-20 ng) in food. The necessity for continued studies indeed becomes apparent based on the challenges to understand, control, and predict enterotoxin production in relation to the food environment. Different types of food, preservatives, processing, and packaging conditions; regulatory networks; and different staphylococcal enterotoxin-producing S. aureus strains need to be further explored to obtain more complete knowledge about the virulence of this intriguing pathogen.",The role of regulatory mechanisms and environmental parameters in staphylococcal food poisoning and resulting challenges to risk assessment,Enterotoxins *** Environmental factors *** Food supply chain *** Predictive modeling *** QMRA *** Regulatory mechanisms *** SEA *** Staphylococcal food poisoning,frontiers in microbiology,85069148374,2019,,,,,,
"© Practical Action Publishing In the Oslo Accord-defined Area C of the West Bank, approximately 11,000 Palestinians are unserved by the water network, forced to rely on water trucking at extremely high prices. In response to this situation, Gruppo di Volontariato Civile (GVC), in partnership with UNICEF, created a programme to subsidize water trucking that alleviates water scarcity while enhancing the sustainability of water service delivery, equitability of tariffs, and predictability of demand. Established in 2014, the programme now covers all the water-vulnerable communities in the West Bank and has reached 35,000 people. The programme links humanitarian and development interventions by using a contiguum approach, where the humanitarian provision of trucked water is accompanied by the construction of water infrastructure and the creation of a multilevel water trucking governance system that defines the roles and responsibilities of all national, regional, and local actors in the water supply chain. By embedding water trucking into the Palestinian Water Authority’s normal activities, the programme is designed to escape a cycle of chronic emergency humanitarian response, in line with the national water sector reform agenda. Eventually, the international donor funding on which the programme depends should be phased out by implementing an equitable, universal water tariff schedule across the entire West Bank, with rates set high enough to subsidize the provision of reliable, safe, and affordable water to the vulnerable residents of Area C.",How a water trucking governance mechanism in the West Bank enhances equity and sustainability,Area C *** Equity *** Water access *** Water governance *** Water trucking,waterlines,85080023476,2019,,,,,,

Currently, in force hygienic normative-methodical documents (SanPiN 2.2.2/2.4.1340-03, SanPiN 2.2.2/2.4.2620-10, SanPiN 2.2.4.3359-16) do not allow to objectively estimating EMF on modern workplaces of personal computers (PCs) users by and other means of information and communication technologies (ICT). Aim of the study is scientific substantiation of improvement of normative-methodical documentation on hygienic regulation and evaluation of EMF in computerized workplaces using modern ICT. Material and methods. The analytical method of evaluation of modern normative-methodical documentation regulating hygienic norms and methods of evaluation of EMF in the workplace of PC users is used. More than 11 thousand measurements of EMF levels were carried out. Results. A critical analysis of the current hygienic regulations of EMF in the workplace of PC users and other means of ICT in Russia showed they to be not scientifically justified, and the existing methodology does not allow an adequate hygienic assessing of the electromagnetic environment (EME). The main sources forming EME on modern workplaces of PC users are both PCs, and switching power supplies, network support devices (UPS), cable lines, wiring, broadband wireless access systems (base stations, Wi-Fi routers, access points, external and built-in laptops USB modems), cell phones, lamps of local and general lighting. EMFs on a workplace of PC users are characterized by complex amplitude-frequency composition: electric and magnetic fields at frequencies of 30 Hz - 300 kHz, EMF at frequencies above 300 MHz, electrostatic fields, hypogeomagnetic fields. New EMF hygienic standards at workplaces of PC users and other means of ICT are scientifically proved. Conclusion. The introduction of new regulations will ensure an adequate hygienic assessment of EMF in the workplaces of PC users in each normalized frequency band in total from all sources and will eliminate the current contradictions and shortcomings. The introduction of new EMF hygienic standards in the practice of sanitary and epidemiological supervision will preserve the health of the PC users and other ICT facilities.",Electromagnetic conditions hygienic assessment at workplaces with personal computers: History and present status,Electric fields *** Electromagnetic fields *** Hygienic standards *** Information and communication technolo-gies *** Magnetic fields *** Measurement and control methods *** Personal computers,gigiena i sanitariya,85078351039,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 K. Jacob et al. A sustainable economy fulfills societal needs in a fundamentally different way to the current economic system. Improvements to the efficiency of existing technologies or practices appear insufficient for achieving sustainable development within the planetary boundaries. Disruptive, systemic and transformational changes appear necessary in order to replace existing technologies and practices to establish a sustainable economy. Such innovations often start out in niches; however, the scaling up and the ultimate replacement of current socio-technical systems requires governance to allow for the coordination of actors, the reorganization of socio-technical systems and the mobilization and allocation of resources. As governmental institutions are part of the current (non-sustainable) systems and thereby fail to provide coherent, integrated and transformative governance, we explore whether institutional innovation from non-state actors can step in to provide governance of transformation processes. Based on explorative qualitative case studies of networks in the food sector, city planning and reporting tools, we analyze the potential of bottom-up institutional innovations to coordinate actors in transformation processes.",Governance for the sustainable economy: Institutional innovation from the bottom up?,Governance *** Infrastructures *** Innovation *** Institutions *** Networks *** Supply chains *** Sustainability *** Sustainable economy *** Transformation,gaia,85072070771,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved. It is generally believed that the process of supplier selection plays a critical role in the purchasing management. To improve the performance of a supply chain network, it is essential to build a strategic and a strong relationships. As such, all firms should select the best suppliers by applying appropriate methods through different selection criteria. An appropriate supplier reduces all purchasing costs as well as increases customer satisfaction to improve the final product and strengthen corporate competitiveness. Due to the natural uncertainty of this dilemma, most of recent works show a great deal of interest in applying uncertainty approaches. The main innovation of this paper is to develop a new multi-objective model for both supplier selection and order allocation operations considering incremental discount in a fuzzy environment. The proposed model considers the material cost with incremental discount and the transportation cost, holding costs along with its control and interest as well as the possibility of payment, brought back, and replacement costs, simultaneously, for the first time in this research area. Based on the proposed fuzzy model, the Zimmermann fuzzy approach is used in order to covert the model in a single objective form. Accordingly, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied to solve the proposed problem. Based on the multi-objective optimization proposed, a Non-dominated Sorting GA (NSGA-II) is also employed to solve the developed model through the multi-objective assessment methodologies. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation and discussion based on the results are provided to reveal the performance of developed methodology.",A multi-objective supplier selection and order allocation through incremental discount in a fuzzy environment,genetic algorithm *** incremental discount *** NSGA-II *** order allocation *** Supplier selection *** zimmermann fuzzy approach,journal of intelligent and fuzzy systems,85069449688,2019,,,,,,

"© 1988-2012 IEEE. Smart grids provide great opportunities for design and implementation of sustainable and efficient electricity supply chains that are more resilient to disruptions. The problem with electricity supply chain network design (ESCND) using smart grid has not been broadly explored by researchers. This paper aims to approach this problem using a multiobjective robust optimization method. The three objectives are economic (profit maximization), environmental (greenhouse gas emissions minimization), and resilience (network resilience maximization). Efficiency maximization-power loss minimization-has also been taken into account using its corresponding cost element in the economic objective function. The proposed approach accounts for different unique smart grid components such as demand side management programs, microgrid structure, two-way distribution lines, and supplier-consumer nodes, while incorporating different interrelated decisions including facility location, capacity expansion, load allocation, and pricing. To solve the resultant model, a hybrid multiobjective robust optimization technique is proposed based on cutting plane and AUGMECON2 algorithms. The proposed model and solution approach are then applied to an actual case study and the produced results are thoroughly analyzed. We find that while economic and environmental objectives can be strictly conflicting, the implementation of smart grids can result in concurrent boost in both environmental performance and network resilience.",Green and Resilient Design of Electricity Supply Chain Networks: A Multiobjective Robust Optimization Approach,Adjustable robust optimization *** cutting plane algorithm *** electricity *** multiobjective optimization *** resilience *** smart grid *** supply chain network design (SCND) *** sustainability,ieee transactions on engineering management,85060560861,2019,,,,,,

Increasing urban water demand and water stress conditions due to population growth, combined with climate change and a non-uniform distribution of water resources in space and time, represent major concerns for water companies. As such, long-term management strategies need to improve the resilience of water supply systems and account for the sustainability of water withdrawals. In this context, metabolic modelling may provide a support to decision-making in the medium-long term, based on sustainability criteria. This approach enables mimicking a water supply network (WSN) based on a set of material and energy fluxes that interact and influence each other. By analyzing these fluxes, a suite of key performance indicators (KPIs) is evaluated in order to identify which kind of interventions may be applied to increase the sustainability of the system. Here, we apply a metabolic model,WaterMet2, to a WSN in the Reggio Emilia Province (Italy), combined with hydraulic simulations conducted with EPANET. Different alternative strategies are compared, including a reduction of water withdrawals from the main well field due to a possible future decrease in water availability. Based on KPIs, sustainable long-term strategies are evaluated in order to identify the most suitable solution for dynamic sustainable management of the water supply system.",Sustainability analysis of alternative long-term management strategies for water supply systems: A case study in Reggio Emilia (Italy),KPIs *** Metabolic modelling *** Resilience; water supply network *** Sustainability *** Urban water system,water (switzerland),85064895098,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 by the authors. The process of shaping distribution network structures is one of the most fundamental design tasks, and determines the delivery certainty of media transported by them. It is especially crucial with reference to network elements of a critical character, such as roads or water supply, sewage, or electrical networks. In urban conditions, the geometric shaping of these structures has a quasi-chaotic character that is individual for each network and city. The complexity of these networks increases significantly with the size of a city, and therefore the evaluation of water delivery certainty is also a difficult issue. Despite many years of research, there is no universal method to evaluate this certainty. The objective of this paper is to present two original approaches: the number of minimal efficiency paths from a water source to reference consumption nodes, and the relation of this number to the fractal dimension of a network's geometric structure. The developed methods were tested in the conditions of a few real water supply networks. The obtained results indicate that the analyzed methods can be used for the preliminary and relatively rapid evaluation of water delivery certainty.",Impact assessment of distribution network layout on the reliability of water delivery,Distribution network *** Reliability assessment *** Water delivery,water (switzerland),85064931698,2019,,,,,,
"© 2018 Elsevier B.V. Supply chain risk management typically deals with the systematic identification, analysis and mitigation of risks which affect the whole supply chain network of a company. Business continuity management (BCM) forms part of supply chain risk management and is an important competitive factor for companies by ensuring the smooth functioning of critical business processes in the case of failures. If business operations are severely disrupted, the companies’ decision maker is confronted with a situation which is characterized by a high degree of uncertainty, complexity and time pressure. In such a context, decision support can be of significant value. This article presents a novel decision support methodology which leads to an improved and more robust BCM for severe disruptions caused by disasters. The methodology is part of the Reactive Disaster and supply chain Risk decision Support System (ReDRiSS) to deal with different levels of information availability and to provide decision makers with a robust decision recommendation regarding resource allocation problems. It combines scenario techniques, optimization models and approaches from decision theory to operate in an environment characterized by sparse or lacking information and dynamic changes over time.

The Authors Background: Comparatively, industry clusters in Africa have retrogressed over the years while their counterparts in Asia, Europe and America serve as engines for innovation and economic development. The textile industry cluster in most African economies has been threatened and is negatively affecting productivity, employment and revenue generation. Their survival, growth and sustainability are critical because of the sector’s contribution to national development Objective: In this ariticle we investigate the role fators such as stakeholder relation among actors in the textile ecosystem, influence of supply chain networks, third-party pressures and technological changes affected the development of textile clusters in Ghana and how the country can rebuild the clusters. Method: Using partial least-square structural equation modelling techninque, we tested theoritical hypotheses using survey data from firms in the industrial enclave of Ghana. Result: The findings from the study acknowledges a sharp decline in the productivity and performance of firms in various industrial sectors especially the textile cluster. The influx of copycat products coupled with the firm’s inability to adapt to changing production technology have been a key influencer in the deteriorating state of the textile industries. Again, gaps in stakeholder interactions and underutilised supply chain networks create bottlenecks that hinder the competitiveness and performance of these enterprises. Conclusion: On the contrary, findings from our study suggest external pressure from donors, multinationals and political influencers do not affect the performance and competitiveness of the textile sector as suggested by previous studies. Resuscitating the industry sector requires deliberate effort to improve coordination, information and technology sharing between key actors.",An empirical examination of the influencers of premature decline of African clusters: Evidence from textile clusters in Ghana, ,south african journal of business management,85072338586,2019,,,,,,

"© 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: This paper aims to address the supplier selection (SS) problem under dynamic business environments to optimize the procurement cost of spare-parts in the context of a mining equipment company (MEC). Practically, involved parameters’ value does not remain constant as planning periods due to fluctuation in the demand and their market dynamics. Therefore, dynamicity in the parameter is considered as an important factor when a company forms a responsive chain through most eligible suppliers with respect to planning periods. This area of study may be considered for their complexities to the approaches toward order-allocations with bi-products of unused and repair spare-parts. Design/methodology/approach: An integrated methodology of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and mixed-integer non-linear programming (MILP) is implemented in the two stages during each planning periods. In the first stage, AHP is used to obtain the relative weights with respect to each spare-parts of each criterion and based on that, the ranking is evaluated in accordance with case considered. And in the second stage, MILP is formulated to find the allocations of each spare-part with two distinct approaches through Model-1 and Model-2 separately. Moreover, Model-1 and Model-2 are outlined based on the ranking and efficient parameters-value under cost, limited capacities, quality level and delay lead time respectively. Findings: The ranking and their optimal order-allocation of potential suppliers are obtained during consecutive planning periods for both unused and repair spare-parts. Subsequently, sensitivity analysis is conducted to deduce the key nuggets with the comparison of Model-1 and Model-2 in the changing of capacity, demand and cost per spare-parts. From this analysis, it is found that suppliers who have optimal parameter settings would be better for order-allocations than ranking during the changing planning period. Practical implications: This paper points out the situation-specific approach for SS problem for a mining industry which often faces disruptive supplying environments. The managerial implication between ranking and parameters are highlighted through Model-1 and Model-2 by sensitivity analysis. Originality/value: It provides useful directions for managers who are involved in the procurement of spare-parts in the mining environment. For this, suppliers are selected for order-allocation by using Model-1 and Model-2 in the dynamic business environment. The solvability of the model is presented using LINGO 17. Furthermore, the case company selected in this study can be extended to other sectors.",Dynamic supplier selection approach for mining equipment company,Mathematical programming *** Multicriteria programming *** Sensitivity *** Supply chain management,journal of modelling in management,85058068852,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: The purpose in this paper is to develop a systematic literature review aiming to reveal innovation opportunities associated with the thematic collaboration and trust in the reverse logistics field. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopted a parallel analysis approach segregating the systematic literature review papers in two groups at NVivo®, collaboration and trust in the supply chain and collaboration and trust in reverse logistics, aiming to explore in the first group of papers insights for innovation on collaboration and trust in reverse logistics. The content analysis strategy was supported by the knowledge exchange theory described in Gravier et al. (2008). Findings: Reverse logistics is hardly dissociated from broader sustainable supply chain management approaches, which make all considerations on collaboration and trust designed for such approaches valuable and valid for reverse logistics. Collaboration and trust concepts in supply chain and in reverse logistics contexts are quite similar, while collaboration/trust is mandatory for managing networks in sustainable approaches and in reverse logistics, as well. Downstream and upstream, the chain disruptive innovation business models may be developed between focal companies and returns system third-party logistics providers, fourth-party logistics providers or end-customers, in a business-to-customer collaboration approach. Several collaboration technologies are listed in three perspectives: knowledge sharing, knowledge generation and knowledge implementation. Research limitations/implications: This study uses a specific protocol for the systematic literature review, and due to inclusion and exclusion criteria, other protocols can provide different results. The strategy of analysis under the knowledge exchange perspective may give a type of result different from other perspectives.

"Copyright © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd. Sustainable supply chain design can be performed using optimisation strategies for minimising environmental impacts while maximising profit. It is not clear how such strategies influence the resilience of a supply chain – its ability to handle disturbances without compromising its function. This research used the ecosystem network analysis (ENA) to evaluate the resilience during the design of a sugar beet supply chain. The ε-constraint method was used to solve a multi-objective, mixed integer linear programming (MOMILP) model. Results showed that ENA results are compromised when the strategy of minimising environmental impacts is used, due to the increased fragility of the configuration, compared with the configuration from the profit maximisation strategy. Sensitivity analysis also revealed that, when the number of facilities is increased, ENA results improve while profit is decreased. ENA showed an interesting potential to support the pursuit of balance between resilience and performance during early design stages.",Exploring ecosystem network analysis to balance resilience and performance in sustainable supply chain design,Ecosystem network analysis *** ENA *** Multi-objective programming. *** Resilience *** SSCD *** Sustainable supply chain design,international journal of advanced operations management,85063569882,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 by the authors. Modern supply chains are vulnerable to high impact, low probability disruption risks. A supply chain usually operates in such a network of entities where the resilience of one supplier is critical to overall supply chain resilience. Therefore, resilient planning is a key strategic requirement in supplier selection decisions for a competitive supply chain. The aim of this research is to develop quantitative resilient criteria for supplier selection and order allocation in a fuzzy environment. To serve the purpose, a possibilistic fuzzy multi-objective approach was proposed and an interactive fuzzy optimization solution methodology was developed. Using the proposed approach, organizations can tradeoff between cost and resilience in supply networks. The approach is illustrated using a supply chain case from a garments manufacturing company.",Interactive fuzzy multi criteria decision making approach for supplier selection and order allocation in a resilient supply chain,Disruption risks *** Fuzzy optimization *** Resilient supply chain *** Supplier selection,mathematics,85061096447,2019,,,,,,

"© 1988-2012 IEEE. The literature examining the relationship between green supply chain management and firm performance has expanded greatly in recent years. Although researchers maintain that green supply chain management can bring positive financial performance, to date they have ignored the moderating role of the social control mechanism, especially in the context of China. Drawing on social exchange theory, this study aims to contribute to the literature in this field by proposing social control as an effective mechanism to strengthen the impact of green supply chain management on firms' financial performance. Today, most empirical literature in the field of green supply chain management adopts the static view and overlooks the contextual factors. This study addresses the gap by investigating the green supply chain management in an environment characterized by frequently unavoidable disruptions, and the effectiveness of social control that accommodates this complexity and dynamism. By examining green supply chain management under conditions of environmental dynamism, this study contributes to the literature of interface of green supply chain and resilience. Using a sample of 185 Chinese manufacturers, the theoretical model is empirically verified. The research findings indicate that in a dynamic environment, the joint effect of social control and green supply chain management practices is positive and significant. This paper also discusses the theoretical contribution and managerial implications of the study, outlines the research limitations, and provides recommendations for future research.",Examining Green Supply Chain Management and Financial Performance: Roles of Social Control and Environmental Dynamism,Contingency theory (CT) *** environmental dynamism *** financial performance *** green supply chain management (GSCM) *** social exchange theory (SET),ieee transactions on engineering management,85030757834,2019,,,,,,
"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd Stakeholders are being increasingly encouraged to improve their supply chain risk management in order to cope efficiently and successfully with disruption risks due to unexpected events. Notwithstanding, supply chain managers lagged behind this target overlooking green development in considering environmental impact which has become a main criterion in supply chain management. Where the era of greenness threatens current supply chain partners with the need to either cope with the new green regulations or leave the field for new players. Thus, an approach to design supply chains that are simultaneously resilient, and green is needed. This study satisfies this need by developing a green and resilient (G-resilient, here after) fuzzy multi-objective programming model (GR-FMOPM) to present a G-resilient supply chain network design in determining the optimal number of facilities that should be established. The objectives are minimization of total cost and environmental impact and maximization of Value of resilience pillars where robustness, Agility, Leanness and Flexibility (V-RALF) can be seen four of main pillars required for supply chain resilience. Fuzzy AHP is used for determining the importance weight for each pillar followed by a usage of a Fuzzy technique for assigning the importance weight for each potential facility with respect to RALF. The importance weights obtained by Fuzzy AHP and the Fuzzy technique are then integrated in the third objective (maximization of V-RALF) to maximize the value of resilience pillars. Based on the fuzzy multi-objective model, the ε-constraint method is used to reveal Pareto optimal solutions and TOPSIS was then used to select the final Pareto solution. A case study is used to validate the applicability of the developed GR-FMOPM in obtaining a G-resilient supply chain network design and a trade-off among economic, green and resilience objectives. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed on the importance weight for facilities Pareto solutions with respect to the importance weight of RALF. Research findings proved that the developed GR-FMOPM could be used as a tool in evaluating and ranking related facilities with respect to their resilience performance. It can also be used to obtain a G-resilient supply chain network design in terms of facilities that should be established towards a trade-off among the three aforementioned objectives.",A hybrid MCDM-fuzzy multi-objective programming approach for a G-resilient supply chain network design,Fuzzy AHP *** Fuzzy multi-objective optimization *** G-resilient *** Green development *** Supply chain resilience *** TOPSIS,computers and industrial engineering,85055746791,2019,,,,,,
"© Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher's Office. Supply chain networks generally are composed of four main entity types: supplier, production centers, distribution centers and demand zones that consist of facilities whose activities involve the transformation of raw material into finished products that are later delivered from the suppliers to the end customers. Supply chain network design as the most important strategic decision in supply chain management, plays an important role in overall environmental and economic performance of the supply chain. The nature and complexity of today's supply chains network make them vulnerable to various risks. One of the most important risks is disruption risk. Disruptions are costly and can be caused by internal or external sources to the supply chain, thus it is crucial that managers take appropriate measures of response to reduce its negative effects. Recovery time of disrupted facilities and return it to normal condition can be an important factor for member of the supply chain. In this paper, a bi- objective model is developed for reliable supply chain network design under facility disruption. To solve this model, we have applied two approaches, i.e., ε constraint method as an exact method and non- dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGAII) as a meta-heuristic method.",A bi-objective programming model for reliable supply chain network design under facility disruption,Bi-objective Programming *** Disruption Risk *** Recovery Time *** Reliability *** Supply Chain Network Design,international journal of integrated engineering,85076016376,2019,,,,,,
"IEEE This article demonstrates the application of a novel multiagent modeling approach to support supply network configuration (SNC) decisions toward addressing several challenges reported in the literature. These challenges include: enhancing supply network (SN)-level performance in alignment with the goals of individual SN entities; addressing the issue of limited information sharing between SN entities; and sustaining competitiveness of SNs in dynamic business environments. To this end, a multistage, multiechelon SN consisting of geographically dispersed SN entities catering to distinct product-market profiles was modeled. In modeling the SNC decision problem, two types of agents, each having distinct attributes and functions, were used. The modeling approach incorporated a reverse-auctioning process to simulate the behavior of SN entities with differing individual goals collectively contributing to enhance SN-level performance, by means of setting reserve values generated through the application of a genetic algorithm. A set of Pareto-optimal SNCs catering to distinct product-market profiles was generated using Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm&#x00A0;II. Further evaluation of these SNCs against additional criteria, using a rule-based approach, allowed the selection of the most appropriate SNC to meet a broader set of conditions. The model was tested using a refrigerator SN case study drawn from the literature. The results reveal that a number of SNC decisions can be supported by the proposed model, in particular, identifying and evaluating robust SNs to suit varied product-market profiles, enhancing SC capabilities to withstand disruptions and developing contingencies to recover from disruptions.",Multiagent Optimization Approach to Supply Network Configuration Problems With Varied Product-Market Profiles,Aggregates *** Dispersion *** Genetic algorithms *** Lead *** Optimization *** Resilience *** Robustness *** Supply chain (SC) design *** supply network (SN) dynamics *** supply network configuration (SNC),ieee transactions on engineering management,85076272708,2019,,,,,,
"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd The closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) management as one of the most significant management issues has been increasingly spotlighted by the government, companies and customers, over the past years. The primary reasons for this growing attention mainly down to the governments-driven and environmental-related regulations which has caused the overall supply cost to reduce while enhancing the customer satisfaction. Thereby, in the present study, efforts have been made to propose a facility location/allocation model for a multi-echelon multi-product multi-period CLSC network under shortage, uncertainty, and discount on the purchase of raw materials. To design the network, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model capable of reducing total costs of network is proposed. Moreover, the model is developed using a robust fuzzy programming (RFP) to investigate the effects of uncertainty parameters including customer demand, fraction of returned products, transportation costs, the price of raw materials, and shortage costs. As the developed model was NP-hard, a novel whale optimization algorithm (WOA) aimed at minimizing the network total costs with application of a modified priority-based encoding procedure is proposed. To validate the model and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, some quantitative experiments were designed and solved by an optimization solver package and the proposed algorithm. Comparison of the outcomes provided by the proposed algorithm and exact solution is indicative of high quality performance of the applied algorithm to find a near-optimal solution within the reasonable computational time.",A robust fuzzy mathematical programming model for the closed-loop supply chain network design and a whale optimization solution algorithm,Closed-loop supply chain network design *** Modified priority-based encoding *** Uncertainty *** Whale optimization algorithm,expert systems with applications,85053844296,2019,,,,,,

"© 2019 by the authors. The purpose of this study is to systematically identify and design improvement planning for supply chain resilience (SCRES) for a higher level of sustainability and a competitive advantage. Literature-based interpretive structural modelling (ISM), a pairing of the systematic literature review (SLR) and ISM approaches, is proposed for investigating and identifying a set of key performance measures of resilience for supply chain (SC) management. In line with previous research, we identified and updated 13 key SC capabilities out of 24 as core performance measures of supply network resilience. Furthermore, our findings categorised each capability and element into one of four types of influential power variables (drivers, dependent, autonomous, or linkage). This study (i) lends support to and updates previous research that examined the core capabilities of SCRES and (ii) provides complementary classifications for the influential powers of SCRES capabilities and elements. The literature indicates that there has been no research that has integrated SLR as a basis to ISM for an effective way to utilize existing studies for increasing awareness and developing managerial guidelines to achieve SCRES.",Evidence-based resilience management for supply chain sustainability: An interpretive structural modelling approach,Interpretive structural modelling *** Supply chain resilience *** Sustainability *** Systematic literature review,sustainability (switzerland),85060076421,2019,,,,,,
"© 2019 Author(s). As economic globalisation increases, inclination toward domestic protectionism is also increasing in many countries of the world. To improve the productivity and the resilience of national economies, it is important to understand the drivers and the barriers of the internatiolisation of economic activities. While internatiolisation of individual economic actors is difficult to explain using traditional theories, aggregate patterns may be explained to some extent. We take a network-centric perspective to describe the extent of corporate internatiolisation in different countries. Based on Newman’s assortativity coefficient, we design a range of assortativity metrics which are appropriate in the firm network context. Using these, we quantify companies’ appetite for internatiolisation in relation to the internatiolisation of their partners. We use the Factset Revere dataset, which is provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc., that captures global supply chain relationships between companies. We identify countries where the level of internationalisation is relatively high or relatively low, and we show that subtle differences in the assortativity metrics used change the ranking of countries significantly in terms of the assortativity correlation, highlighting that companies in different countries are prone to different types of internationalisation. Overall, we demonstrate that firms from most countries in the dataset studied have a slight preference to make supply chain relationships with other firms which have undergone a similar level of internationalisation, and other firms from their own country. The implications of our results are important for countries to understand the evolution of international relationships in their corporate environments, and how they compare to other nations in the world in this regard.",Assortativity and mixing patterns in international supply chain networks, ,chaos,85061813912,2019,,,,,,
"Big Data is one of the recent technological advances with the strong applicability in almost every industry, including manufacturing. However, despite business opportunities offered by this technology, its adoption is still in early stage in many industries. Thus, this study aimed to identify and rank the significant factors influencing adoption of big data and in turn to predict the influence of big data adoption on manufacturing companies' performance using a hybrid approach of decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)- adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS). This study identified the critical adoption factors from literature review and categorized them into technological, organizational and environmental dimensions.

"The construction sector is currently undergoing a shift from stick-built construction to modular building systems that take advantage of modern prefabrication techniques. Long established in-situ construction practices are thus being replaced by processes imported from the manufacturing sector, where component fabrication takes place within a factory environment. As a result of this transformation, current construction supply chains, which have focused on the delivery of raw materials to sites, are no longer apt and need to make way to new, strengthened, and time-critical logistics systems. The aim of this study is to establish a mathematical model for the optimisation of logistics processes in modular construction covering three tiers of operation: manufacturing, storage and assembly. Previous studies have indicated that construction site delays constitute the largest cause of schedule deviations. Using the model outlined in this paper we seek to determine how factory manufacturing and inventory management should react to variations in the demand on construction sites. A two-stage stochastic programming model is developed to capture all possible demand variations on site. The model is evaluated using a case study from the residential construction sector. The application shows that the model is effective and can serve as decision support to optimise modular construction logistics.",Optimal logistics planning for modular construction using two-stage stochastic programming,Logistics *** Modular construction *** Inventory *** Supply chain *** Two-stage stochastic programming,automation in construction,WOS:000443663900005,2018,,,,,,
"Food (in)security has become a challenge not only for developing economies but also for High Income Countries. In parallel, food scholars have actively investigated the contribution of alternative food networks (AFNs) to the development of more sustainable and just food systems, paying attention to drivers, initiatives and policies supporting the development of alternatives to the dominant industrialised food system and its detrimental environmental and socio-economic impacts. However, few studies have directly addressed the contribution of AFNs to food security in the Global North. This paper aims to establish new linkages between food security debates and critical AFNs literature. For that purpose, we conduct a place-based approach to food security in a comparative analysis of initiatives of three different European contexts: Cardiff city-region (UK), the Flemish Region (Belgium) and the peri-urban area of the city of Valencia (Spain). The results unfold: i) how AFNs weave a more localised socio-economic fabric that creates new relationships between food security outcomes and specific territories, ii) hybridization processes within alternative but also conventional systems and iii) the role of advocacy and collective action at different levels. The analysis allows identification of key elements on which food security debates hinge and provides new insights to ground conceptual discussions on territorial and place-based food security approaches.",Exploring the contribution of alternative food networks to food security.

"Corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues in suppliers can affect the reputation of buyers or even result in supply chain disruption. Thus, buyer and supplier firms are urged to comply with CSR codes in a coordinated manner. In other words, multinational buyers are expected to extend CSR practices to their suppliers in emerging countries. This is particularly crucial when suppliers' CSR performance is screened under a regulatory agency's inspection regime. To this end, this study formulates an analytical model to understand the effects of buying firms' supportive schemes, i.e., technical assistance programmes, on their partner suppliers' CSR performance. Specifically, we develop a multi-period behavioural model to simulate a system consisting of multiple buyers and suppliers where the government regularly conducts inspections on suppliers' CSR performance. The results from the agent-based simulation analysis shed light on (1) how the dyadic risk preferences of suppliers and buyers affect suppliers' CSR performance; (2) how the gap between the perceived and actual CSR levels in a supplier interacts with the regulatory agency's tactics to influence suppliers' CSR performance; (3) the extent to which the overall suppliers' CSR performance improvement is attributable to the buyers' technical assistance programmes under the regulatory agency's inspection regime. This research contributes to the socially responsible supply chain management literature and provides innovative managerial insights for policy makers (e.g., CSR regulators) to promote CSR practices among suppliers.","Technical assistance, inspection regime, and corporate social responsibility performance: A behavioural perspective",Corporate social responsibility *** Buyer-supplier relationship *** Technical assistance *** Inspection *** Behavioural *** Multi-period,international journal of production economics,WOS:000451938400005,2018,,,,,,

"With the growing attention to Sustainable Production and Consumption (SPC) initiatives, organizations are seemingly locked in a battle with SPC implementation barriers. The successes of improving business activities in the theme of supply chain, motivates this study to investigate SPC trends in supply chain. Therefore, we aim to improve the implementation of SPC by identifying and evaluating the barriers in supply chains. The limitation of necessary resources to remove the barriers requires the organizations to investigate and prioritize the challenges. The proposed framework in this paper applies fuzzy Analytical Network Process for the evaluation. The framework classifies the key barriers into organization, supply chain, regulation, and customer dimensions which the first two are designed to be internal dimensions and the other two are external. A real case from fitting industry is studied and the related supply chain is entirely considered to examine the proposed approach of this study. The results show that for implementation of SPC the internal barriers are of greater concern compared to the external barriers. The organization dimension obtained the highest rank followed by customer, supply chain and regulation barrier dimensions. (C) 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

"Purpose The alignment of procurement strategy with overall business strategy is important for superior firm performance. It is also essential for firms' purchasing structure to fit the purchasing strategy whether it is cost reduction; value analysis and/or improving delivery and increasing flexibility for achieving superior purchasing performance. The purpose of this paper is to scientifically examine the influence of organization culture (OC), green supplier development (GSD), supplier relationship management, flexibility and innovation on sustainability in supply network (SSN) under the moderation effect of institutional pressures and resources availability. Design/methodology/approach The study is grounded by integrating institutional theory (IT) and resource-based view (RBV) theory. The study empirically tests the conceptual model through survey data gathered from 175 respondents in the KwaZulu-Natal province of Southern Africa using structural equation modeling which is a multivariate data analysis technique that permits to simultaneously examine many relationships among manifest and latent variables. Findings It was found that OC plays a crucial role in shaping the workforce behavior and responsible for enhancing GSDs and building good relationship with suppliers which ultimately results into increased flexibility and innovativeness. Coercive pressures (CPs) play a moderating role between the causal relationship of innovation and SSN. Therefore, CPs have got the ability to amplify or reverse the effect between innovation and SSNs. Research limitations/implications The study suffers from few limitations. First, the study is restricted to one particular province in South Africa. Second, cross-sectional data were used for testing of model in the research study. Practical implications The findings are of great importance for both the researchers and supply chain practitioners. Supply chain practitioners may use this knowledge for benchmarking the supply network configuration process and continuously improve the process. The tested model actually shows the mechanism for enhancing SSNs. In today's dynamic and uncertain business environment, all firms in the supply network aims to minimize risks and maximize profitability. The findings show that CPs play a moderating effect on the relationship between innovation and SSN. Whenever government authorities and institutions pressurize firms for minimizing pollution levels, we see a trend of increased innovations in the form of new product developments, usage of eco-friendly raw material and application of eco-friendly technology which ultimately minimizes the carbon footprint. Through such initiatives steel and engineering firms conform to the government norms and regulations. However, innovations are possible through collaboration with specialist suppliers and sub-suppliers by adopting a common standard across the supply network. Through this overall process of innovation, the focal firm and sub-suppliers linked in the network will benefit and ultimately achieve a competitive edge. Therefore, firms can experience multiple benefits in terms of lower development costs, lower project cycle completion time, improvement in design for re-manufacturability, low downtime, low supply risks, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and, ultimately, sustainable development. Originality/value The study is unique from dual perspective - both in terms of scope and contribution to supply chain management literature. First, the study integrates flexibility and innovation to study the impact on SSNs. Second, it integrates both IT and RBV theory of firm to test the moderation effect and the findings further opens up window for future research.",Importance of innovation and flexibility in configuring supply network sustainability,Innovation *** Flexibility *** Institutional theory *** Collaborative relationships *** Resource-based view *** Sustainability in supply networks,benchmarking-an international journal,WOS:000452516900028,2018,,,,,,
"Resilience in the context of supply chains has received particular attention over recent years. Companies have been aware of the need to adopt resilience strategies in supply chain management. Therefore, considering resilience factors in the process of assessing and classifying suppliers (ordinal classification or sorting) is relevant. Supplier classification for further selection is a multiple criteria decision problem, which involves several criteria. In this paper, we adopt the ELECTRE TRI-nC method, which allows us to classify the suppliers taking into account multiple criteria and the decision makers' preferences, including resilience criteria. The method was applied to classify the suppliers of a manufacturing industry from an emerging economy (India). A sorting model was collaboratively constructed through an interaction process between the analysts and the decision makers (industrial managers). The proposed approach contributes to the decision process of selecting suppliers by providing a pre-classification of a set of suppliers into three different categories of overall performance. The results show that the proposed method is suitable and useful as a decision aiding tool for purchasing decisions, allowing managers to obtain robust conclusions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

"Emergencies and disasters place an exceptional demand on the managerial skills of the humanitarian aid community. Most of the developing countries lack in such kind of resilience and effective humanitarian supply chain. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to identify and analyse the factors to develop the resilience in the humanitarian supply chain. Based on the literature review, total 12 factors related to resilient humanitarian supply chain have been identified. Some of these factors are process oriented and some are result oriented. Interpretive structural modelling with Fuzzy MICMAC analysis is used to develop structural relationships among these factors and to find the driving and the dependence power of these factors. Government support, strategy and capacity planning; and continuous assessment of project progress have emerged as the major drivers for the development of resilient humanitarian supply chain. By managing these driving factors, humanitarian aid programme can be made resilient and agile. The findings will be useful for the humanitarian aid agencies to develop effective and sustainable aid relief programme.",Analysing the interaction of factors for resilient humanitarian supply chain,supply chain coordination *** supply chain resilience *** fuzzy logic *** resilience management *** supply chain management,international journal of production research,WOS:000453290100006,2018,,,,,,
"Sustainable development is a common global theme of the 21st century. Global environmental issues have attracted increasing public attention in recent years. As one of the most important industries in Taiwan, the automotive industry needs to implement green supply chain management to comply with current trends, and the selection of suppliers of green parts is particularly important in this regard. Supplier selection is a classic case of multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM). A traditional method, called the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)-based analytical network process (ANP) (DANP), is appropriate to solve the problem of supplier selection. This study proposes a novel variant of DANP, called grey DANP, to effectively reduce the huge problem arising from pairwise comparisons. An empirical study was used to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed grey DANP. It contributes to finding the key factors of selecting green suppliers for Taiwan's automotive industry, including technology, delivery time, environmental management system and pollution control. The cause-effect relationships among key factors indicate that the environmental management system should be given more attention by manufacturers in the selection of green suppliers.",Green supplier selection for sustainable development of the automotive industry using grey decision-making,analytical network process *** DEMATEL *** green supplier *** grey relational analysis *** MCDM *** sustainable development,sustainable development,WOS:000454305300034,2018,,,,,,
"This paper considers the trade-offs of two-tier supply chain enterprises in an uncertain environment, and can be formulated into a two-tiered multi-programming formula. The model we proposed considers green building alternatives' cost, duration and carbon emissions uncertainties simultaneously, making it more realistic comparing to models in previous literature. In this model, the interval number and expected value based on Me are adopted to handle the uncertain coefficients contained in the objective function and constraints, then a stochastic-based robust optimization method is developed to get a solution that can resist the uncertain environment. To solve the complex and non-linear bi-level multi-follower model, an interactive fuzzy programming technique combined an effective multi-objective algorithm, NSGA-II, is designed as the solution method. Finally, an applicant for a contractor of Urban Construction Group and its sub-contractors is given as an illustration that demonstrates the practicality and efficiency of the proposed model. The sensitivity analysis towards the change of important parameters is also provided. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

"A closed-loop supply chain network design is a facility location problem combined with forward and reverse logistics. To reflect the environmental fluctuations and the market competitiveness, recycled products will be remanufactured and sold to obtain the advantages of achieving green environmental protection and of reducing cost. This study considers the uncertain factors such as the quantity of customer product demand, the quantity of recycled used products, and the facility opening cost to design a fuzzy mixed-integer linear programming model for a closed-loop supply chain network design under uncertainty. A two-stage interactive possibilistic programming procedure is constructed to obtain a preferred compromise solution. Four fuzzy optimization approaches are embedded into the two-stage interactive possibilistic programming model and are compared. After computing experimental testing, we find that this study, based on the TH fuzzy approach, obtains a more efficient balanced compromise solution than other fuzzy approaches.",Comparisons of interactive fuzzy programming approaches for closed-loop supply chain network design under uncertainty,Closed-loop supply chain network *** Uncertainty *** Facility location *** Fuzzy programming *** Possibilistic programming,computers & industrial engineering,WOS:000449569500040,2018,,,,,,
"Due to globally increased demand of drinkable and usable water, countries are focusing more in building desalination plants. Desalination plant location selection is a strategic decision and decision makers need to deal with multiple criteria that are sometimes conflicting in nature. In addition to technical and operational aspects, sustainability (social, environmental, economical) aspect needs to be considered in desalination plant location decision. The purpose of this paper is to develop a multi-criteria decision support system (DSS) to rank desalination plant location criteria in United Arab Emirates (UAE) by considering social, environmental, economical, technical and operational aspects. Result shows that technical (21.9%) and economical (20.9%) are top two main aspects of desalination plant location criteria. Similarly, waste water discharge (22.2%), life species (13.3%), real cost of water and government subsidy (18%), quality and quantity of fresh water (12.4%), and water supply network (9%) are the top ranked sub-criteria of environmental, social, economic, technical, and operational aspects respectively.",A multi-criteria decision support system to rank sustainable desalination plant location criteria,Desalination plant *** Decision support system *** Plant location criteria *** Analytical hierarchal process *** Sustainability criteria *** Multi-criteria decision making,desalination,WOS:000443662900004,2018,,,,,,
"This paper intends to develop a multi-objective solid transportation problem considering carbon emission, where the parameters are of gamma type-2 fuzzy in nature. This paper proposed the defuzzification process for gamma type-2 fuzzy variable using critical value (CV) and nearest interval approximation method. A chance constraint programming problem is generated using the CV based reduction method to convert the fuzzy problem to its equivalent crisp form. Applying the a-cut based interval approximation method, a deterministic problem is developed. Some real life data are used to minimize the cost and carbon emission. LINGO standard optimization solver has been used to solve the multi-objective problem using weighted sum method and intuitionistic fuzzy programming technique. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm are implemented to generate efficient optimal solution by converting the multi-objective problem to a single objective problem using penalty cost for carbon emission. After solving the problem, analysis on some particular cases has been presented. The sensitivity analysis has been shown to different credibility levels of cost, emission, source, demand, conveyance to find total cost, emission and transported amount in each level. A comparison study on the performance of three algorithms (LINGO, GA and PSO) is presented. At the end, some graphs have been plotted which shows the effect of emission with different emission parameters.",A gamma type-2 defuzzification method for solving a solid transportation problem considering carbon emission,Solid transportation problem *** Gamma type-2 fuzzy variable *** CV reduction method *** Carbon emission *** Nearest interval approximation *** Weighted sum method *** Intuitionistic fuzzy programming technique *** Genetic algorithm *** Particle swarm optimization,applied intelligence,WOS:000446426900009,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: This study aims to present a competitive advantages framework suited for disaster prone regions in the era of climate change, present supply chain cooperation (SCC) as an integral part of GrSCM within the automobile industry and evaluate the competitive advantages framework merits based on SCC as a new implementation tool. Design/methodology/approach: In an effort to address limited green supply chain management implementation strategies in disaster prone regions, the paper presents SCC as an economic, social and political implementation tool. To explore this; the study introduces SCC in a three-phase competitive advantages model adopted from the Barney 1995 model (with slight differences). Smart PLS 3.0 software package was adopted to carry out multi-variable data analysis. The study’s assumption is a capital economic system and bases its argument of analysis on stockholder theoretical lenses. Findings: Big company size does not significantly affect SCC, suggesting that companies of all size can organize and enhance their network to be cooperative. Companies with cooperative supply chain network tend to have competitive advantages. SCC is also a viable way to manage business risks, be there internal or external. Research limitations/implications: One of the study’s limitation is the stockholder theory it adopts, which shoulders its assumptions on a capital economic model of operation. Indeed, the study covered China, which is seen to be a communist-based economy. Another study’s limitation is that it narrows its data collection to disaster prone areas as documented by Guha-Sapir et al. (2012). Consequently, the findings of this study might be only applicable to areas that experience significant level of disruptions usually caused by disaster incidents. Originality/value: The study is also the first of its kind to propose a model for automobile manufacturing in disaster prone regions. This is done by introducing SCC as an economic, social and political factor, while risk ranking is introduced as an environmental factor to constitute the external changes that Barney 1995 introduced.",Supply chain cooperation as a green supply chain management implementation strategy to achieve competitive advantages in natural disaster prone regions,Automobile industry *** Competitive advantages *** Green supply chain management *** Natural disasters *** Supply chain cooperation,competitiveness review,85057812504,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to theoretically hypothesise and empirically test the impact of sustainable supply chain practices (SSCPs) on firms’ financial risk. Design/methodology/approach: This research adopts signalling theory to explain the signalling role of SSCPs and the moderating role of the signalling environment in terms of supply chain characteristics. It collects and combines longitudinal secondary data from multiple sources to test the direct impact of SSCPs on firms’ financial risk and the moderating role of supply chain complexity and efficiency. It conducts various additional tests to check the robustness of the findings and to account for alternative explanations. Findings: This research shows that SSCPs help firms reduce financial risk but do not affect their returns. Moreover, the risk reduction of SSCPs is greater for firms with more complex and efficient supply chains. The findings are robust to alternative variable measurements and analysing strategies. Research limitations/implications: This research reveals the role of SSCPs in reducing financial risk, urging researchers to pay more attention to the financial risk implications of supply chain practices in general and SSCPs in particular. Practical implications: This research encourages firms to engage in SSCPs to reduce financial risk and enables them to assess the urgency of their SSCPs investments in view of the complexity and efficiency of their supply chains. Originality/value: This is the first research examining the impact of SSCPs on financial risk, based on longitudinal secondary data and signalling theory.

"© 2018 Elsevier B.V. Product management activities have typically focused on the innovation, acquisition, expansion and management of product lines and products. However, product deletion or discontinuation is also critical. Despite its strategic importance, product deletion has received relatively less attention in both academia and practice. Researchers have conceptually investigated product deletion, its influence on firm's resources, the factors influencing product deletion decisions, and the product deletion process. However, very few papers have related product deletion decisions to supply chain management, especially when leanness and sustainability are major objectives. This paper aims to integrate lean and sustainable supply chain dimensions with product deletion by proposing a multilevel decision model that can facilitate a product deletion decision with an objective of developing a leaner and more sustainable supply chain. The model has three major decision dimensions with 8 factors with 29 influencing determinants. The model uses an integrated analytical hierarchy/network process (AHP/ANP) and a benefits, opportunities, cost and risks (BOCR) analysis. An illustrative company scenario is provided for the model application. The paper contributes by filling an important gap by integrating lean and sustainable supply chain management and product deletion literature to formulate a product deletion decision making model which aids in enhancing the leanness and sustainability of supply chains. The model also allows for cross-functional participation involving marketing, operations, finance, and environmental sustainability fields.",Addition by subtraction: Integrating product deletion with lean and sustainable supply chain management,Analytical hierarchy/network process model *** BOCR analysis *** Lean supply chain *** Product deletion *** Supply chain management *** Sustainability,international journal of production economics,85054859479,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018, Springer Nature B.V. The electronics industry is growing fast with the advent of new technologies and product innovation across the globe. Short product life cycle coupled with the huge demand for electronics products, generating a pile of discarded products results in e-waste generation. The industry is also facing the higher product returns due to the increase in online business and liberal policies offered to the consumers. Effective and efficient reverse supply chain implementation may help in managing these returns along with the end of life product returns. Despite a growing body of research in the area of reverse supply chain, industries are reluctant to adopt best practices of the reverse supply chain. The proposed study aims at exploring the key strategic issues and challenges faced by the electronics industry by using case study method. A case of Indian Electronics Organization is analyzed to identify key strategic issues and challenges in the managing reverse supply chain.

This paper investigates the relationship between product complexity, disruption and performance using the role of resilience capabilities as moderating variables in the relationships mentioned above. The relationships have been tested using data from the sixth editions of the International Manufacturing Strategy Survey (IMSS). Data highlights how product complexity increases the probability of disruption occurrence, which in turn affects plant performance, while resilience allows supply chains to reduce the harmful effects of a disruption.","Linking product complexity, disruption and performance: the moderating role of supply chain resilience",capabilities *** complexity *** International Manufacturing Strategy Survey (IMSS) *** plant performance *** Supply chain resilience,supply chain forum,85058194507,2018,,,,,,
"Lignocellulosic biomass derived fuels and chemicals are a promising and sustainable supplement for petroleum-based products. Currently, the lignocellulosic biofuel industry relies on a conventional system where feedstock is harvested, baled, stored locally, and then delivered in a low-density format to the biorefinery. However, the conventional supply chain system causes operational disruptions at the biorefinery mainly due to seasonal availability, handling problems, and quality variability in biomass feedstock. Operational disruptions decrease facility uptime, production efficiencies, and increase maintenance costs. For a low-value high-volume product where margins are very tight, system disruptions are especially problematic. In this work we evaluate an advanced system strategy in which a network of biomass processing centers (depots) are utilized for storing and preprocessing biomass into stable, dense, and uniform material to reduce feedstock supply disruptions, and facility downtime in order to boost economic returns to the bioenergy industry. A database centric discrete event supply chain simulation model was developed, and the impact of operational disruptions on supply chain cost, inventory and production levels, farm metrics and facility metrics were evaluated. Three scenarios were evaluated for a 7-year time-period: (1) bale-delivery scenario with biorefinery uptime varying from 20 to 85%; (2) pellet-delivery scenario with depot uptime varying from 20 to 85% and biorefinery uptime at 85%; and (3) pellet-delivery scenario with depot and biorefinery uptime at 85%. In scenarios 1 and 2, tonnage discarded at the field edge could be reduced by increasing uptime at facility, contracting fewer farms at the beginning and subsequently increasing contracts as facility uptime increases, or determining alternative corn stover markets. Harvest cost was the biggest contributor to the average delivered costs and inventory levels were dependent on facility uptimes. We found a cascading effect of failure propagating through the system from depot to biorefinery. Therefore, mitigating risk at a facility level is not enough and conducting a system-level reliability simulation incorporating failure dependencies among subsystems is critical.",Simulation Modeling for Reliable Biomass Supply Chain Design Under Operational Disruptions,operational disruptions *** biorefinery *** pre-processing *** biomass *** depots *** simulation,frontiers in energy research,WOS:000447327200001,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd Honey is a natural sweetener that requires minimal industrial technologies and is the subject of thriving markets along with its derived products. It has been estimated that about 35% of food consumption depends directly on the pollination of fruit and vegetable crops. A Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) case-study is applied in the agro-food sector to assess the social and socio-economic aspects of the life cycle of honey through the Subcategory Assessment Method (SAM). The objectives of this paper are three-fold: i) evaluate the capability of S-LCA to capture the complexity of a multifunctional product, which delivers fundamental ecosystem services with consequences at environmental, economic and social levels; ii) identify how to define and represent, with robust indicators, the positive social aspects generated by honey life cycle; iii) identify the steps to improve the S-LCA methodology, especially for its application to complex product systems, such as the agri-food ones. This paper presents a methodological framework to support decision makers in order to evaluate the social sustainability of the Italian honey sector. The presence of positive social aspects in the life cycle of a jar of honey was highlighted as well as a strong connection between the honey product and local community. Furthermore, a weak relation between suppliers along the entire supply chain emerged. The findings lead to the conclusion that further developments are required in order to improve the assessment of the multifunctional product and to reinforce the awareness of the social sustainability by starting from strong collaborations within the supply chain.",Assessment of social dimension of a jar of honey: A methodological outline,Honey *** Multifunctionality *** Semi-qualitative method *** Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) *** Social sustainability *** Subcategory Assessment Method (SAM),journal of cleaner production,85053140810,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 Elsevier B.V. When managing a global supply chain, one critical challenge encountered by multinational enterprises (MNEs) is the extension of corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices to suppliers in emerging countries. In this study, we use a multi-method approach to explore 1) the nature of suppliers’ CSR heterogeneity based on the various components of CSR in emerging countries, and 2) the choices of MNEs for extending CSR to different types of suppliers in dynamic environments. We begin with a survey of Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) servicing MNEs to examine how these suppliers vary in CSR implementation based on cluster analysis results. To understand the choices made by MNE buyers for extending CSR to their OEM suppliers, we conduct an agent-based simulation study considering the dynamics of a system with multiple agents (i.e., MNE buyers, OEM suppliers, and the government). The cluster analysis results show that CSR practices implemented by Chinese OEMs differ significantly from one another and can be classified into three clusters (i.e., Leader, Follower, and Laggard). The simulation results provide insights into how the adaption costs (e.g., upgrade cost and cost saved by downgrading) and punitive (inspection with possible penalties) and supportive (subsidies) tactics adopted by the government affect the choices made by MNE buyers for extending CSR practices to suppliers in emerging countries. Moreover, we demonstrate when supportive tactics are more effective than punitive tactics under varying conditions and extend the model to investigate the consequences of switching between these two types of tactics in a sequential simulation.",Multinational enterprise buyers’ choices for extending corporate social responsibility practices to suppliers in emerging countries: A multi-method study,Emerging country *** Empirical analysis *** Extending corporate social responsibility *** Multi-agent simulation *** Multinational enterprise buyer *** Original equipment manufacturer supplier,journal of operations management,85047303417,2018,,,,,,

"© 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Organic and low-input food systems are emerging worldwide in answer to the sustainability crisis of the conventional agri-food sector. “Alternative” systems are based on local, decentralized approaches to production and processing, regarding quality and health, and short supply-chains for products with strong local identities. Diversity is deeply embedded in these food systems, from the agrobiodiversity grown in farmers’ fields, which improves resilience and adaptation, to diverse approaches, contexts and actors in food manufacturing and marketing. Diversity thus becomes a cross-sectoral issue which acknowledges consumers’ demand for healthy products. In the framework of the European project “CERERE, CEreal REnaissance in Rural Europe: embedding diversity in organic and low-input food systems”, the paper aims at reviewing recent research on alternative and sustainable food systems by adopting an innovative and participatory multi-actor approach; this has involved ten practitioners and twenty-two researchers from across Europe and a variety of technical backgrounds in the paper and analysis stages. The participatory approach is the main innovation and distinctive feature of this literature review. Partners selected indeed what they perceived as most relevant in order to facilitate a transition towards more sustainable and diversity based cereal systems and food chains. This includes issues related to alternative food networks, formal and informal institutional settings, grass root initiatives, consumer involvement and, finally, knowledge exchange and sustainability. The review provides an overview of recent research that is relevant to CERERE partners as well as to anyone interested in alternative and sustainable food systems. The main objective of this paper was indeed to present a narrative of studies, which can form the foundation for future applied research to promote alternative methods of cereal production in Europe.",A multi-actor literature review on alternative and sustainable food systems for the promotion of cereal biodiversity,Locally based agriculture *** Low-input cereal supply-chains *** Low-input farming *** Safe and healthy diet *** Sustainable agriculture,agriculture (switzerland),85056566005,2018,,,,,,

"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd Certain sectors and paths along supply chains play a critical role in climate change mitigation. We develope a consumption-based framework, which combines input–output analysis, a power-of-pull approach and structural path analysis, and applied it to supply chain networks derived from 2010 and 2012 Jing-Jin-Ji interregional input–output tables. The aim of this study is to identify (1) the key economic sectors for controlling carbon emissions and their changes, (2) the critical directions from a carbon-pulling sector to the emissions of key economic sectors, and (3) the paths with the largest carbon emissions flux in these critical directions. Our results show that the key sectors are from Hebei and Tianjin, more concentrated in Hebei. Most sectors have the largest pulling power over their own carbon emissions, and within-region connections dominated in the emission network, with a stronger tie between Beijing and the other two regions. Critical paths along carbon-pulling directions are located in tiers 0 and 1. Our framework can provide new insight into the creation of carbon emissions control policies.",Critical sectors and paths for climate change mitigation within supply chain networks,Carbon emissions *** Climate change *** Input-output analysis *** Power-of-pull analysis *** Structural path analysis *** Supply chain,journal of environmental management,85053085907,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the self-declared sustainability initiatives of the world’s four largest chocolate manufacturers (Ferrero, Mars, Mondelez and Nestlé) and the measures they take to tackle social problems within the context of establishing sustainable sourcing of cocoa in Ghana and the Ivory Coast. Global cocoa supply chains are under continuous media and public scrutiny. Recent incidents of malpractice in supply chain management have left global chocolatiers vulnerable in terms of how they deal with social issues across their global supply chain networks. Critics have argued that there is a lack of consistency and transparency between what companies say and do in upholding sustainable practices across their supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: The authors draw from the sustainable supply chain literature to develop our theoretical parameters and undertake a case-based analysis of the existing sustainability practices of these chocolatiers. Using the insights from this analysis, the authors propose a conceptual framework for a rigorous comparative assessment of self-declared sustainable sourcing initiatives of global agricultural supply chains. The methodology is qualitative and the research method is a secondary-data case study. Findings: Four main parameters were identified and used to compare self-declared initiatives, namely: social sustainability certification from respectable bodies; code of conduct for suppliers; partnerships with the primary supply chain stakeholders; and supplier collaboration programme and improvement initiatives. The case companies chosen have implemented several initiatives, but the most prominent seem to indicate the reliance on third-party certification. Not all companies adopted a supplier code of conduct. The partnerships and collaboration programmes with different associations are presented as efficient for companies as well as farmers. Improvements in the conditions of farmers are advocated as a key result. Research limitations/implications: This paper is based on self-declared secondary data. Subsequently, it is possible that the case companies did not document some practices; or that companies do not do what they claim. Practical implications: This paper provides a comprehensive framework for agricultural businesses to compare their sustainability efforts and improve the performance of their supply chains, particularly those who belong to the cocoa supply chains. The proposed framework allows an assessment of initiatives at policy, strategic, tactical and operational levels to improve social sustainability of supply chains. Social implications: This paper may help companies to think more clearly about greater transparency and provide the impetus for dealing more effectively with serious social issues in agricultural supply chains such as: child labour, child trafficking, modern slavery, etc. It may also instruct consumers to better understand what companies do as part of their sustainability agenda, alongside the communication of other features of their products, such as quality. Originality/value: The framework adds value by providing a novel way to systematically compile and analyse data around self-declared sustainable initiatives. Actors within agricultural supply chains can use the framework to assess and drive their sustainability efforts and practices, leading to ways to improve the social performance of their global supply chains.",Benchmarking self-declared social sustainability initiatives in cocoa sourcing,Agricultural products *** Cocoa supply chain *** Social sustainability *** Supply chain ethics *** Sustainable sourcing *** Sustainable supply chains,benchmarking,85058025054,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd As policy makers acknowledge the high degree of supply chain vulnerability and the impact of maritime emissions on coastal population health, there has been a consistent effort to strengthen maritime security and environmental regulations. In recent years, overdependence on deeper and wider multinational supply and production chains and lean-optimization has led to tightly integrated systems with little “slack” and high sensitivity to disruptions. This study considers the impact of Emission Control Areas and establishes a link between environmental and network resilience performance for maritime supply chains using operational cost and SOx emissions cost metrics. The proposed methodological framework analyzes various abatement options, disruption intensities, fuel pricing instances and regulatory strategies. The methodology utilizes a minimum cost flow assignment and an arc velocity optimization model for vessel speed to establish the payoff for various network states. Additionally, an attacker defender game is set up to identify optimal regulatory strategies under various disruption scenarios. The results are complemented by a sensitivity analysis on SOx emissions pricing, to better equip policy makers to manage environmental and resilience legislation. The methodology and findings provide a comprehensive analytic approach to optimize maritime supply chain performance beyond minimisation of operational costs, to also minimize exposure to costly supply chain disruptions.",The impact of flexible environmental policy on maritime supply chain resilience,Attacker-defender game *** Emission control areas *** Network resilience *** Supply chain management,transport policy,85054803396,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd In today's world supply chain has become more complex due to the multiplicity of drivers created by globalization, global geopolitical risk, technological disruption, market uncertainty, mass-customization and changing laws and regulations. Supply Chain Complexity (SCC) is one of the most difficult problems in today's global supply chains and assumed as the key impediment to business performance. SCC has the significant adverse impact on competitiveness, cost efficiency, customer satisfaction, product innovation and market share. It is imperative for the focal firm and its supply chain managers to know SCC drivers causing supply chain complexity. Identification and prioritizing of SCC drivers are required for effective monitoring and controlling of supply chain management. SCC drivers can be categorized based on the origin of their generation as upstream, operational, downstream and external. This paper presents the study conducted in leading earthmoving and mining equipment manufacturing firms in India, to understand the supply chain complexities for off-road & mining equipment industries. Qualitative situation-actors-process (SAP) and learning-action-performance (LAP) model has been applied to understand and analyze the concept of supply chain complexity drivers and its dynamic behavior. Quantitatively multi-criterion decision making (MCDM) is used in prioritizing SCC drivers due to the subjectivity of drivers. An AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) study has also been done to quantify and prioritize SCC drivers for managerial decision making. This study contributes towards developing a priority ranking of SCC drivers based on its impact on overall SCC which have significant importance in supply chain strategic planning. The current research investigates evolving SCC drivers like supplier resourcing risk, supplier competence, regional strategies, shortening product life-cycle, changing customer service expectation which were not adequately addressed in existing literature. Our research findings provides practical insights to managers in understanding the role of SCC drivers like market uncertainty and risk, changing laws and regulations, constant change in customer requirement, multiplicity of customers, forecast inaccuracy, sustainable supply chain practices in the overall outcome of ranking. The outcome of this study also enriches the existing literature of SCC with practitioners’ insight from manufacturing industry.",Analysis of supply chain complexity drivers for Indian mining equipment manufacturing companies combining SAP-LAP and AHP,Analytic hierarchical process *** Mining equipment *** Supply chain complexity driver *** Supply chain management,resources policy,85052150148,2018,,,,,,
"Managing highly evolved supply chains and maintaining environmental sustainability at the same time is not easy, especially when it is vulnerable to various disruption risks. In the event of a disruption, the sustainability of a supply chain will be compromised as a consequence of attempting to quickly recover from the disruption with minimal costs. However, a balance can be achieved between sustainability and recovery. Companies can maintain its sustainability, while recovering its operations with a comprehensive analysis of the decision criteria for the intended system. This study presents a recovery model of a two-stage serial supply chain subject to supply disruption with consideration of safety stock and carbon emission. The system consists of a single manufacturer and a single retailer, while the carbon emission consideration is from the transportation activities during the recovery cycle. The model is capable of determining the new recovery schedule of the manufacturer and the retailer, the optimal safety stock level, and the carbon emission cost impact during recovery. The results show that for a range of short disruption periods, the optimal safety stock level is significantly affected by the holding cost values. Furthermore, the cost of carbon emission is dependent on the number of recovery cycles, the distance between supply chain entities, and the social cost of carbon at the time of the disruption. A comparison of two disruption scenarios with different transportation arrangement illustrates a solution for a better recovery plan with faster recovery cycles, lower total recovery cost, and without any change to carbon emission cost impact. This study contributes to the supply disruption literature with the findings on how safety stock and environmental effect consideration affect the disruption recovery decision-making process in term of lot sizing and transportation arrangement.

"Owing to the growing number of risk factors that can be triggered by natural and manmade disasters, management of disruption risks in supply chains has become increasingly significant. Since the market concentration of raw material suppliers is a determinant of the supply disruption risk, identification of raw materials vital in a supply chain and concurrently whose markets are highly concentrated will help supply chain risk management. In this study, we develop a graph theory-based methodology for assessing supply chain vulnerability to disruption risks by using the life cycle inventory (LCI) database as a data source for nationwide supply chains. A supply chain structure, i.e., raw material-to-product links and overall chain, is modeled by a directed graph and its adjacency matrix, adapted from physical input-output data in the LCI database. The reachability components in the supply chain are identified by Boolean matrix calculations. Vulnerability indicators for each reachability component are determined on the basis of market concentration as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index in terms of domestic production regions and import partners as a proxy for the extent of supply disruption risks. The methodology developed is demonstrated using the national-level LCI database of Japan, and vulnerability factors are presented for 23 types of Japanese synthetic resins. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"Awareness of environmental pollution, interest in recycling, and the importance of closed-loop supply chain management are all on the rise. In a closed-loop supply chain, production planning is influenced by uncertainty not only from customers' demand, but also from collectors due to difficulties in the reverse logistics flow. Therefore, it is important to develop a robust closed-loop supply chain model to respond to uncertainty from reverse logistics. In this study, we develop a deterministic mixed-integer optimization model and robust counterparts to cope with the uncertainty of recycled products and customer demand in the fashion industry. We show that a robust counterpart with a budget of uncertainty is equivalent to a robust counterpart with a box uncertainty under special conditions. To avoid the conservatism of a robust solution, an alternative optimization problem is developed to take advantage of the budget of uncertainty. To verify the performance of the proposed model, numerical experiments are conducted. The simulation results show the proposed model responds robustly to uncertainty and is superior to a deterministic model and other robust counterparts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

"Purpose The purpose of this study is to identify and discuss the role of intelligent materials in the emergence of new business models based on the Internet of Things (IoT). The study suggests new areas for further research to better understand the influences of material intelligence on the business models in industry-wide service ecosystems. Design/methodology/approach The study uses data from an earlier study of intelligent materials in the steel industry networks. The insights are based on 34 qualitative interviews among 15 organizations in the industry. The data are reanalyzed for this study. Findings The observations from the steel industry show how material intelligence can be harnessed for value creation in IoT-based business ecosystems. The results suggest that not all things connected to the IoT need to be intelligent, if information related to the things are collected, stored and shared for collaborative value creation among the actors involved in the business ecosystem. Research limitations/implications The study discusses how IoT deployments allow businesses to benefit from the velocity and variety of information associated with things and guides future research to study the ways in which value is created through IoT-enabled business models. Practical implications Rather than focusing on improving the efficiency of the supply network, the study presents new paths for competitive advantages in the new IoT ecosystems.

"Electronic waste recycle (e-recycling) is gaining increasing importance due to greater environmental concerns, legislation, and corporate social responsibility. A novel approach is explored for designing the e-recycling reverse logistics network (RLN) under uncertainty. The goal is to obtain a solution, i.e., increasing the storage capacity of the logistics node, to achieve optimal or near-optimal profit under the collection requirement set by the government and the investment from the enterprise. The approach comprises two parts: a matrix-based simulation model of RLN formed for the uncertainty of demand and reverse logistics collection which calculates the profit under a given candidate solution and simulated annealing (SA) algorithm that is tailored to generating solution using the output of RLN model. To increase the efficiency of the SA algorithm, network static analysis is proposed for getting the quantitative importance of each node in RLN, including the static network generation process and index design. Accordingly, the quantitative importance is applied to increase the likelihood of generating a better candidate solution in the neighborhood search of SA. Numerical experimentation is conducted to validate the RLN model as well as the efficiency of the improved SA.",Improved Simulated Annealing Based Network Model for E-Recycling Reverse Logistics Decisions under Uncertainty, ,mathematical problems in engineering,WOS:000454815600001,2018,,,,,,
"How are teams able to cope with environmental threats? Why are some teams better than others in facing this challenge? This paper addresses these questions by investigating two drivers of team resilience: the team size and the density of social interactions among team members. We adopt a complex system approach and employ a model of team decision-making where collective dynamics of team members are governed by a continuous-time Markov process. The model simulates team performance in complex and turbulent environments. It is used to measure the resilient ability of team to quickly adapt to disturbance and secure a new more desirable condition. Scenarios characterized by increasing levels of complexity and turbulence are simulated, and the resilience performance is calculated and compared. Results show that the team size negatively affects the team resilience, whilst the density of social interactions plays a positive influence, especially at a high level of complexity. We also find that both the magnitude and the frequency of disturbance moderate the relationship between team size/density and the team resilience.",Team Resilience in Complex and Turbulent Environments: The Effect of Size and Density of Social Interactions, ,complexity,WOS:000440914300001,2018,,,,,,
"The concept of sustainability has become an essential theme for many industries and organisations due to a heightened sensitivity towards environmental protection and social responsibility. At the same time, firms still need to achieve economic viability and retain their competitive advantage. Because suppliers are the first entity and the initial source of any supply chain, organisations should select their suppliers by a careful evaluation of their critical success factors (CSF). Achieving a successful sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) strategy requires a firm to consider its stakeholders' views. Based on the CSF theory and by considering the multi stakeholders' view in a sustainability perspective, this work provides a decision support system for the sustainable supplier selection (SSS) problem in a real world textile industry located in the emerging economy of India. Through a three-phase methodology, this study examines Indian suppliers by considering the sustainability views of various stakeholders, including employees, customers, researchers, shareholders, and a government environmental officer. The CSF priorities show that the first four influential CSFs are categorized as social concerns (i.e., maintaining long-term relationships and affiances, stakeholder empowerment, equity labour sources, and individual human rights). The fifth factor is an environmental issue (i.e., production of polluting agents). Among the five suppliers being evaluated in this work, Supplier 4 receives the top ranking. Specifically, the results show that the supplier rankings are highly influenced by CSF's social dimensions. Hence, to validate the influence of CSF's social dimensions in relation to the SSS process, a sensitivity analysis has been done by varying the respective weights. The study concludes with the relevant managerial implications and limitations.",Role of multiple stakeholders and the critical success factor theory for the sustainable supplier selection process,Stakeholder theory *** Critical success factor *** Triple bottom line *** Sustainable supplier selection *** Multi criteria decision making *** Fuzzy Delphi *** ISM *** ANP *** COPRAS-G,international journal of production economics,WOS:000418974300030,2018,,,,,,
"This study aims to map out the relationships that make up green innovation initiatives in Brazilian industry. The sample comprised 100 managers at manufacturing companies, most of them operating in the business of farm machinery and equipment (45 managers) and steel structures (14 managers). To develop this study, Medeiros et al. (J Clean Prod 65:76-86, 2014) study, mapping critical factors that drive the success of green product innovation and the paradigm of complexity, was used as a reference study. Based on the results, it was possible to identify that the operational dynamic of the factors and variables that affect market success do not happen in an isolated or fragmented way; they occur systematically with different contingencies and structured basic and intermediate skills in order to meet the expectations of consumers, laws, and environmental legislation. Initially, the technological expertise factor was noted as very important for sustaining green product innovation. Furthermore, since proactive leaders are an important factor for successfully developing environmentally sustainable products, it must be added to technological expertise as the foundation for developing green innovation. After defining the basis for green product innovation, the intermediary conditions necessary for using the available technology appropriately were mapped out. In this sense, variables such as elimination of cultural barriers, capacity for critical reflective analysis, and experimentation are also very important. In addition, some of the variables of the cross-functional collaboration and market knowledge factors were a part of the structure that organizations need to transform potential into developing green products, which is the basis for the third level of the model. The fourth level of the model has the meeting consumer expectations and following law and legislation factors, which make up the main goals for developing environmentally sustainable products according to a number of surveys that were conducted.",Driving Factors for the Success of the Green Innovation Market: A Relationship System Proposal,"Innovation strategy *** Teams, people and organization *** Methodology",journal of business ethics,WOS:000419949900005,2018,,,,,,
"Purpose This conceptual paper aims to explore how supply chain managers deal with social threats to supply chains, in the process of demonstrating the potency of a largely neglected strand of realist social theory. This theory, as posited, sheds a great deal of light on the behavioural reality of how supply chain managers operate within the social aspects of their risk environments. Design/methodology/approach The paper is presented as a narrative synthesis of classical realist sociological literature. Findings The Machiavellian approach provides a template that can be used to help academics and practitioners understand how and why supply chain managers orient themselves to the social threats they confront in very different ways. The theory's contention that the behavioural reality can be subdivided between two basic patterns allows it to serve as a constructively simple template for becoming attuned to ways in which supply chain managers socially construct and act within their social threat environments. Research limitations/implications The growing social complexity of supply chains gives behavioural responses a complexity reduction function. The authors theorise that such patterns, once activated, may not necessarily adapt rationally as guides to optimise the chance of success against the full range of social threats they are likely to encounter. Originality/value Cross-disciplinary supply chain management research is increasingly drawing upon sociology and behavioural science to facilitate greater understanding of not only the supply chain environment but also the roles of supply chain managers as relationship influencers and managers of conflict. The authors posit that Machiavellian-realist social theory can contribute to supply chain management scholarship by offering a constructively simple approach to evaluate the behavioural realities associated with social threats.",A Machiavellian behavioural framing of social conflict risks in supply chains,Managers *** Risk *** Conflict *** Machiavellianism *** Realism *** Analysis *** Other management related topics,management research review,WOS:000447559800003,2018,,,,,,
"Purpose - Strategic sourcing and supply risk management have become interesting topics of research in the recent years. Automotive industry experts are increasingly focussing on improving the supply efficiency and performance towards gaining sustainable competitive advantage. This study aims to classify, through an exhaustive review of past literature, the various enablers and barriers of strategic sourcing risk management (SSRM) and use them to identify the problems in the automobile sector. Design/methodology/approach - For the purpose of this research, responses were collected through structured questionnaire from respondents belonging to senior management cadre in the industry. Factor analysis and force field analysis tools have been used for analysis. Findings - Through independent exploratory factor analysis (EFA), four SSRM enablers, namely, supplier risk assessment, data sharing in supply network, partnership with supplier and supply flexibility, were identified. Similarly EFA revealed four SSRM barriers, namely, cost focus, ad hoc or poor planning, data security/privy breaches and hard visualization of SSRM benefits. Through a force field analysis, it was found out that the barriers had a higher impact on the SSRM initiatives than enablers. Practical implications - The research suggests the ways how managers can reduce the impact of barriers and increase the enabling forces. Originality/value - This paper enumerates the barriers and enablers together on the same platform to prioritize and evolve strategies to overpower the barriers and strengthen the enablers.",Force field analysis of Indian automotive strategic sourcing risk management enablers and barriers,Enablers *** Barriers *** Force field analysis *** Strategic sourcing,measuring business excellence,WOS:000444807300004,2018,,,,,,
"Despite companies' efforts to develop lean thinking in their industrial context, the implementation of many lean projects has not been consistently successful, often resulting in delay, failure, abandonment or rejection. Whereas some authors emphasised that company characteristics, like the product demand profile, are significant factors in lean projects, other studies analysed the impact of national culture. This paper aims to study the combined effect of various factors related to national culture and company characteristics of lean implementation barriers in order to determine whether the environmental context in which the company operation can affect the outcome of lean project implementation. A survey has been conducted to collect information about companies of various sizes (small-medium-large) in all industry fields. Data from companies, including manufacturing firms, in 23 different countries, were analysed in depth by a combination of Association Rules and Network Analysis. The results show that some national culture dimensions, such as Performance Orientation and Gender Egalitarianism, influence lean management success and help to maintain a lean culture. Maintaining a lean culture is even more critical than developing it. Furthermore, if the implementation of lean practices is an arduous task for large organisations, it becomes even greater for SMEs. Other cultural factors of individuals such as Uncertainty Avoidance, Future Orientation and Institutional Collectivism also help to support a lean culture and overcome human and cultural barriers.",The moderating effects of corporate and national factors on lean projects barriers: a cross-national study,Lean management *** barriers for lean implementation *** lean success factors *** national culture *** association rules,production planning & control,WOS:000449072200002,2018,,,,,,
"In the past few decades, an interest in reverse logistics has attracted the attention of industries and also has become a subject of interest for researchers. However, while reverse logistics is becoming a mandatory element of the supply chain in developed countries particularly due to legislation issues, the subject is still in a state of infancy in emerging economies such as Brazil. In these connections, impediments to reverse logistics implementation must be considered and analyzed, as well as the many different perspectives from the key stakeholders for their development. The objective of this research is to evaluate the interrelationship among reverse logistics barriers from the perspectives of the most important stakeholders in the Brazilian context. For this purpose, a Multi-Criteria Decision Making tool named grey-based Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (grey-DEMATEL) was used to extract a multiple company-customer-government association perspective. Three respondents - one expert from each stakeholder - have been consulted to obtain the pair-wise comparison of barriers. Thus, both the net effect and the importance level of each impediment are provided by means of a Euclidean distance analysis, as well as the similarities and differences among stakeholders' opinions. The uniqueness of this paper relies on the fact that no previous work was found in the domain of multiple stakeholders' perspective for reverse logistics barriers. This research uncovers that most of the key barriers from the reverse logistics multiple perspectives framework are from the organizational point of view. This stakeholder holds 10 out of 13 key barriers for RL implementation; as such, it is an important outcome because it indicates that firms may begin product return implementation by first tackling key internal barriers. Moreover, knowing the influential factors in their environment may assist industry managers to better implement and manage reverse flows, and to see through current and future green solutions for reverse logistics.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the strength and weakness connected to the implementation of a local food logistics services, designed to facilitate and enable the use of local food among restaurants. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 60 restaurateurs located in a small Italian city and 100 owners of micro and small-sized farms, located within a 30 km radius from the city, have been interviewed. The collected data have been analysed through descriptive analysis and Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests for differences between gender, production type and business size. Findings - The results agree with existing literature: poor communication and an unstructured logistics limit the interaction among actors. However, significant for the purpose, the data show that producers are interested in expanding their market and restaurateurs are interested in a broader supply of local products, and they both open to a logistics service that improves the supply of local food. Research limitations/implications - The following exploratory study is based on a sample of farmers and restaurants in a specific area so the results could not be generalised in a national/international context. Practical implications - The logistics service objective is the promotion of a sustainable territory development in support of the social economy values.

"In recent years maritime logistics infrastructures are the global links among societies and economies. This challenges adversaries to intrude on the cyber-dependent ICTs by performing high-level intelligent techniques. A potential cyber-attack on such infrastructures can cause tremendous damages starting from supply chain service disruption ending up with threatening the whole human welfare. Current risk management policies embed significant limitations in terms of capturing the specific security requirements of ICTs and control/monitoring devices, such as IoT platforms, satellites and time installations, which are primary functioning for the provision of Maritime Logistics and Supply Chain (MLoSC) services. This work presents a novel risk assessment methodology capable of addressing the security particularities and specificities of the complex nature of SCADA infrastructures and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) of the Maritime Logistics Industry. The methodology identifies asset vulnerabilities and threats to estimate the cyber-risks and their cascading effects within the supply chain, introducing a set of subsequent security assessment services. The utilization of these services is demonstrated via a critical, real-life SCADA scenario indicating how they can facilitate supply chain operators in comprehending the threat landscape of their infrastructures and guide them how to adopt optimal mitigation strategies to counter or eliminate their cyber-risks.",A Novel Risk Assessment Methodology for SCADA Maritime Logistics Environments,maritime logistics services *** SCADA infrastructures *** cyber-physical systems *** risk assessment *** cyber-attacks *** mitigation strategies *** LNG transport,applied sciences-basel,WOS:000445760200066,2018,,,,,,
"The upcoming logistic environment is about to modify deeply the way we supply products. In fact, some new trends are going to require more and more agility between a large number of stakeholders in open and dynamic networks. This should be possible to achieve thanks to new data collection and treatment abilities. Considering this moving technological and logistic environment, it appears necessary to define and categorize more specifically the main disruptive events that can affect a supply chain. In fact, amount of data are collected on the field and must be helpful to make relevant decisions in case of disruption. In order to understand automatically what these data mean, it is necessary to detect and classify the disruptive events in order to find the best adaptation.

"Due to increasing diversity and growing size of modern industrial supply chains, today problems of identification, assessment and mitigation of disruption risks become challenging goals of the supply chain risk management. In this paper, we focus on environmental (ecological) risks in supply chains which represent threats of adverse effects on living organisms, facilities and environment by effluents, emissions, wastes, resource depletion, etc. arising due to supply chain's activities. Harmful environmental disruptions may ripple through the supply chain components like a wave. The paper presents the entropy-based optimisation model for reducing the supply chain model size and assessing the economic loss caused by the environmental risks subject to the ripple effect. A main advantage of the suggested entropy-based approach is that it permits to essentially simplify the hierarchical tree-like model of the supply chain, at the same time retaining the basic knowledge about main risk sources.",Entropy-based model for the ripple effect: managing environmental risks in supply chains,industrial supply chain *** risk analysis *** environmental risks *** ripple effect *** information entropy,international journal of production research,WOS:000433968100008,2018,,,,,,
"Purpose Most scholars acknowledge the role of firm-stakeholder relationship for enabling corporate sustainability (CS), but existing literature tends to apply a superficial understanding of interaction. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to advance knowledge by challenging classical stakeholder theory with fundamental insights from the IMP perspective, which in turn leads to a deeper conceptualization of interactive CS. Design/methodology/approach A typology framework is developed through an abductive research design grounded in the concepts of actors, resources, and activities. The authors illustrate the potential of the framework through a longitudinal case study. The empirical case revolves around an initiative for recycling of plastic material in a partly beforehand established supply chain, and the study reveals three main findings. Findings First, recycling solutions can result in major technological challenges. For example, using recycled material can jeopardize industrial quality standards. Second, third-party stakeholders represent critical knowledge and competence that can remedy technological challenges. Finally, R&D projects are important means for developing firm-stakeholder relationships. Research limitations/implications The paper introduces IMP concepts to the CS debate, which can illuminate the emerging literature on tensions and paradoxes related to CS phenomena. Further research is needed on the role of non-business actors as capacity generators for social and environmental change in traditional business networks. Practical implications The proposed framework can be used to analyze why some stakeholders (individuals and groups) turn into contributing actors in inter-organizational relationships, while others remain latent. Originality/value This paper illustrates the usefulness of actor bonds, resource ties and activity links as explanatory concepts. Moreover, developed relationships in terms of collaboration and networks represent a capacity to change, which is overlooked in current CS debates.",The role of interaction for corporate sustainability,Case study *** Corporate sustainability *** Interaction *** Tensions *** ARA *** Stakeholder relationships,imp journal,WOS:000427150600008,2018,,,,,,
"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to measure and map the potential transportation network impedance to last-mile delivery (LMD) using spatial measures representing attributes of road network and planning controls. Design/methodology/approach The transport network impedance is estimated as the potential hindrance to LMD as imposed by the characteristics of the built and regulatory environment. A matrix of key transport and planning measures are generated and overlaid in geographical information systems to compute and visualise the levels of transportation network impedance to LMD using a composite indexing method. Findings The mapped outputs reveal significant spatial variation in transportation network impedance to LMD across different part of the study area. Significant differences were detected along the road segments that connect key industrial hubs or activity centres especially along tram routes and freight corridors, connecting the Port of Melbourne and logistic hub with the airport and the Western Ring Road. Research limitations/implications The use of static measures of transport and urban planning restricts the robustness of the impedance index, which can be enhanced through better integration of dynamic and real-time movements of business-to-business LMD of goods. Spatial approach is valuable for broader urban planning at a metropolitan or council level; however, its use is somewhat limited in assisting the daily operational planning and logistics decision making in terms of dynamic routing and vehicle scheduling. Practical implications The built and regulatory environment contributes to the severity of LMD problem in urban areas. The use of land use controls as instruments to increase city compactness in strategic nodes/hubs is more likely to deter the movement of urban freight. The mapped outputs would help urban planners and logisticians in mitigating the potential delay in last-mile deliveries through devising localised strategies such as dedicated freight corridors or time-bound deliveries in congested areas of road network. Originality/value This is the first study that measured the potential transport network impedance to LMD and improved understanding of the complex interactions between urban planning measures and LMD.

"As a natural disaster and inevitable phenomenon, droughts are frequently seen in vast areas of different countries, particularly in areas with hot and dry climates. It has resulted in heavy economic, social, and environmental losses. Undoubtedly, the first step to cope with droughts and their consequences is to have an accurate understanding of droughts and their effects on different aspects by specifying the related strategies and approaches in this regard. Given the importance of this issue, the present study was conducted to investigate how to model farmers' perception of consequences of drought through structural equation modeling in Birjand Township, Iran. All farmer households living in rural areas of Birjand (a city in the Iranian province of Southern Khorasan) composed the statistical population of this study (N=6057). As many as 200 households were chosen for the study by using Bartlett's table. In total, 20 villages were considered as the target districts using stratified random sampling. The results showed that the most important consequences of droughts understood by the farmers are their economic (0.341), environmental (0.261), and social (0.138) consequences. The highest indirect effects on the farmers' perception of consequences of drought in Birjand were: reduced income (0.286), increased bank debts (0.272), reduced purchasing power (0.265), and the wells, aqueducts and springs that have dried (0.224) respectively. In this regard, measures such as supporting the investment and entrepreneurship, granting banking facilities and credits, governmental oversight on water withdrawals from groundwater sources, development of infrastructures and irrigation and water supply networks, reuse of wastewater, identification and promotion of products compatible with saline and unconventional waters, development of support services and social security for rural communities and development and promotion of drought insurance are proposed in order to reduce the consequences of drought.","USING STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING APPROACH TO INVESTIGATE FARMERS' PERCEPTION CONSEQUENCES OF DROUGHT (CASE STUDY: BIRJAND TOWNSHIP, IRAN)",drought *** consequences of drought *** structural equation modeling *** farmers' perception *** Birjand Township,applied ecology and environmental research,WOS:000424382600034,2018,,,,,,
"Logistics sustainability plays a critical role in our daily life since logistics involves in large number of resources such as manpower, transportation vehicles, warehouses, and products which should be sustain ably leveraged. One possible way to achieve the sustainability is to make the coordinated development of logistics and economy. Due to the complexity of the logistics industry, better coordination among all relevant parties are challenging. The purpose of this research is to analyze the key factors on the coordinated development between metropolitan economy and logistics. This paper uses a Bayesian Network to examine their impacts. Several contributions are significant. Firstly, it is observed that the coordinated development of metropolitan economy and logistics heavily relies on their development levels as their posterior probability values are both over 80%. Secondly, two causation chains greatly affected the coordinated development are found. Scientific value of this research is that special attentions should be paid to key factors like logistics infrastructure investment, the development level of logistics industry, basic research and development level, and the technological development level within the chains when carrying out sustainable decision-makings.

"Petroleum Supply Chain is one of the most important and sophisticated managing missions in both developing and developed countries. Nowadays, environmental pollution is another critical factor in designing the petroleum supply chain. This importance encourages the governments to minimize the amount of environmental pollution and maximize their obtained profit simultaneously, by enacting required legislations on the transportation modes and the refineries. Considering maximizing the job creation and each stakeholder's profit, and minimizing the emission of CO2 and other greenhouse gases at the same time is called Sustainable Petroleum Supply Chain which has been paid little attention despite its significance. Therefore, the modelling of petroleum supply chain considering sustainability and pricing issues is investigated for the first time in this work and a sustainable competitive petroleum supply chain (SCPSC) model is developed to minimize pollution while maximizing the profits and job creation. This problem is a two level model. The first level in SCPSC is the competition between the supply chains of the government and the private sectors, which is modelled by the game theory approach including Nash and Stackelberg equilibria. The optimal price and demand for each supply chain determined in the first level are considered as the second level parameters. In the second level, the optimal values of the decisions in designing the petroleum supply chain will be obtained by solving Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) under the mentioned three objective functions. Finally, the proposed model is applied to a real world case in the national Iranian oil company (NIOC). Based on the results of the Stackelberg equilibrium, the government profits increase by 11.12% while that of the private sector decreases by 25.4 and 28.11%. Increasing in the government profit is due to increased demand provided by government. The results show that the whole profit of the petroleum supply chain in Nash equilibrium is 9.8% more than that in the Stackelberg equilibrium.

"The purpose of this article is to analyze the role of critical success factors in Short Food Supply Chain (SFSC). The study presents a small farmers' cross-cultural analysis - two Italian and two Brazilian milk and dairy producers - that shortened their Food Supply Chain (FSC) to get closer to the consumers and to deliver products with high quality and traceability, and at the same time increase profits. The reduction of distances and the elimination of intermediaries, solely, may increase production earnings in the SFSC, but it does not assure a long-term position in food markets. Success factors for SFSC were identified and retrieved from the literature and presented to three Italian and three Brazilian experts in FSC for analyzing each case. It was found that producers had cultural difficulties for SFSC model adoption, but economic reasons as cutting costs of transportation and elimination of intermediary agents justified their initiatives. However, consolidation of SFSC implementation still requires environmental protection efforts linked to better production processes in small farms, and health safeguards for consumers, as well as the preservation of the cultural heritage associated with the region of origin of the production.

"Nowadays, process optimization has been an interest in engineering design for improving the performance and reducing cost. In practice, in addition to uncertainty or noise parameters, a comprehensive optimization model must be able to attend other circumstances which might be imposed in problems under real operational conditions such as dynamic objectives, multi-responses, various probabilistic distribution, discrete and continuous data, physical constraints to design parameters, performance cost, computational complexity and multi-process environment. The main goal of this paper is to give a general overview on topics with brief systematic review and concise discussions about the recent development on comprehensive robust design optimization methods under hybrid aforesaid circumstances. Both optimization methods of mathematical programming based on Taguchi approach and robust optimization based on scenario sets are briefly described. Metamodels hybrid robust design is discussed as an appropriate methodology to decrease computational complexity in problems under uncertainty. In this context, the authors' policy is to choose important topics for giving a systematic picture to those who wish to be more familiar with recent studies about robust design optimization hybrid metamodels, also by attending real circumstances in practice. In particular, production and project management are considered as two important methodologies that could be improved by applications of advanced robust design combining with metamodel methods.

"In this work an extended pooling problem is formulated to select the optimal price policy for the ingredients of a formulated product such as a detergent. Various contracts for obtaining discounts as a functionof the amount purchased are considered including fixed discount, linear, logit, a discount beyond a certain amount purchased and constant elasticity. The feature is that while certain ingredients are used in large amounts, others represent only a small fraction of the product. The problem becomes an MINLP that it is solved for the optimal product formulation selecting the contract on a year and on a multiperiod basis. Various mathematical reformulations are proposed. The results show the selection of the contractis ingredient dependent but it is quite robust with the environmental burden. However, this decision can change when actual contract conditions on the limiting amounts for the discount are provided to the model. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"This article proposes a mixed-integer programming (MILP) model to determine the strategic and tactical level decisions of lignocellulosic bioethanol supply chain subject to different sources and types of uncertainty. A comprehensive classification, including sources of uncertainty, corresponding parameters and possible reasons which may cause the uncertainty, as well as an up to date and systematic literature review of biofuel supply chain optimal design and planning studies which consider uncertain input data are presented. To handle different types of uncertainty, including randomness, epistemic and deep uncertainties, a hybrid robust optimization model is proposed. Uncertainty in technology is presented as imprecise conversion rates, which are expressed as probabilistic scenarios. Biomass yield is treated as fuzzy numbers while demand is assumed to vary in a known interval. Furthermore, fixed costs of the biorefineries are calculated according to the piecewise linear functions in which segments are capacity level intervals. In order to investigate the performance of the proposed models a case study is developed for bioethanol supply chain located in Iran. Computational results show that the proposed robust model outperforms deterministic model in terms of given performance measures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"To save lives and reduce suffering of victims, the focus of this paper is to design the strategies of relief distribution regarding beneficiary perspective on sustainability. This problem is formulated as a multi objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming model to maximize the lowest victims' perceived satisfaction, and minimize respectively the largest deviation on victims' perceived satisfaction for all demand points and sub-phases. Then, genetic algorithm is proposed to solve this mathematical model. To validate the proposed methodologies, a case study from Wenchuan earthquake is illustrated. Computational results demonstrate genetic algorithm here can achieve the trade-off between solution quality and computation time for relief distribution with the concern of sustainability. Furthermore, it indicates that the methodology provides the tools for decision-makers to optimize the structure of relief distribution network and inventory, as well as alleviate the suffering of victims. Increasingly, this paper expects to not only validate the proposed model and method, but also highlight the importance and urge of considering beneficiary perspective on sustainability into relief distribution problem.

"Cashew consumption has been increasing globally, but environmental issues through the whole cashew supply chain, from production, processing and transportation, have been raised. Thus, green supply chain redesign has been put forward but implementation of related practices faces many barriers. Using the case of the Africa cashew industry, which produces over half of global raw cashew nuts but only process less than 10% to kernel, this paper systematically identifies these barriers considering stakeholders through the whole cashew supply chain. Based on evaluation of four experts, results by grey Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory reveal that successful green supply chain redesign implementation needs two elementary efforts by kernel distributors. One is increased collaboration with multi-tier suppliers (producer organizations and processors) and the other is to get strategic support from industry bodies, non-governmental organizations and development agencies. Additionally, in the short-term, kernel distributors need to overcome three key operational barriers, lack of internal top-level management commitment, lack of integrated management information and traceability systems, and uncertainty of economic benefits. Furthermore, barriers such as difficulties to assess environmental sustainability performance and lack of consumer demand for green cashew should be addressed in the long-term. This study contributes to identify barriers to the successful implementation of green supply chain redesign from perspectives of both the focal enterprise and the whole supply chain. A robust multi-criteria decision making method further reveals the most important and fundamental barriers which can offer decision support for kernel distributors and policymakers in the cashew industry.",Evaluating barriers to green supply chain redesign and implementation of related practices in the West Africa cashew industry,Green supply chain *** Redesign *** Barriers *** Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation *** Laboratory *** Cashew *** West Africa,resources conservation and recycling,WOS:000437079300022,2018,,,,,,
"This investigation aims to propose a hybrid three-stage Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) - Artificial Neural Network (ANN) - Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) approach, together abbreviated as the SEANIS, for analyzing the factors influencing cloud computing adoption (CCA) services in the context of Indian private organizations. This study proposed new determinants, namely risk analysis and perceived IT security risk as an extension of the Technology Organization Environment (TOE) model. The data collected from the industry experts were analyzed using SEM and ANN approaches. The results of SEM revealed that trust (T), management style (MS), technology innovation (TI), risk analysis (RA), and perceived IT security risk (PITR) exercised a significant influence on CCA. The SEM results were taken as inputs for the ANN approach and ISM methodology. The results of ANN highlighted that perceived IT security risk, trust, and management style were the most important determinants for CCA. On the other hand, the ISM tool identified five factors, namely, decrease of internal systems availability (F1) (PITR cluster), utilization of internal resources (F14) (MS cluster), assurance of data privacy increases adoption rate (F16) (T cluster), innovativeness (F21), and previous experience (F22) (both from the TI cluster) as the top five significant variables with high driving power, among the 43 factors. The outcome of the hybrid approach is intended to guide the decision and policy-makers for easy evaluation of their organizational goals for choosing the most suitable computing environment for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of their business performance.",Analyzing the factors influencing cloud computing adoption using three stage hybrid SEM-ANN-ISM (SEANIS) approach,Cloud computing adoption *** SEM *** ANN *** ISM *** MCDM *** SEANIS,technological forecasting and social change,WOS:000440116500008,2018,,,,,,
"Supply disruption is a common phenomenon in industry, which brings destructive effects to downstream firms and damages the sustainability of the supply chain. To mitigate the supply disruption risk, the authors investigate two types of procurement strategies for a firm with two ordering opportunities. Through establishing Stackelberg game models, the authors drive the supplier's optimal production, and the firm's optimal procurement and replenishment strategies under the option purchase (OP) strategy and the procurement commitment (PC) strategy, respectively. The findings show that, under both types of strategies, the firm's procurement follows a threshold principle. Moreover, the firm's procurement quantity can be represented by two newsvendor solutions. A lower option price or option exercise price benefits the firm, while it damages the supplier. The supplier benefits from a higher mean value (MV) of emergency procurement price and the firm benefits from a lower market demand variability. Counter-intuitively, a lower MV of the emergency procurement price is not always beneficial to the firm. A higher market demand variability could be beneficial to the supplier under the PC strategy. The firm should first choose the PC strategy and then change to the OP strategy as the disruption risk increases.",Managing Procurement for a Firm with Two Ordering Opportunities under Supply Disruption Risk,supply disruption *** option purchase strategy *** procurement commitment strategy *** random emergency procurement price *** strategy selection,sustainability,WOS:000446770200336,2018,,,,,,
"With the strategic importance of discerning opportunities and threats from technological development to achieve sustainable competitiveness, exploring technological trends becomes critical for a successful technology strategy in logistics. Given the rapid pace of development and varying technological options, logistics also increasingly requires methodological support and appropriate data to reduce the complexity and burden of exploring technology trends. While previous research has largely relied on experts' insights, the value of patent-based approaches for exploring technological trends has been underestimated in logistics. To address this gap, this study proposes a topic modeling-based approach using logistics-related patents registered at the United States Patents and Trademark Office (USPTO). The core of the suggested approach is latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), allowing the identification of logistics-related technological topics behind patents. The topics identified by LDA are further investigated regarding both filed-level and firm-level trends. The suggested approach is expected to offer implications of the use of patents for the purpose of exploring the trends of technology development outside the organization in logistics. In addition, we believe that the information on the technological topics and their trends generated by the suggested approach can offer an enhanced understanding of the technological landscape in logistics.",Exploring Technological Trends in Logistics: Topic Modeling-Based Patent Analysis,technological trends in logistics *** technology trend exploration *** patent analysis *** topic modeling *** latent dirichlet allocation,sustainability,WOS:000446767700226,2018,,,,,,

"The extensive use of hazardous products has resulted in quickly increasing on hazardous wastes. Due to the rising environmental pressure and economic benefit, the reverse supply chain design for hazardous products is becoming increasingly important and urgent. In this paper, we consider the closed-loop supply chain network design for hazardous products (HP-CLSCND), including both forward supply chain and reverse supply chain. The uncertainty inherent in closed-loop supply chain network will significantly influence the overall performance of the closed-loop supply chain network design. This paper focuses on the HP-CLSCND problem with uncertain demands and returns, and a two-stage stochastic programming model (scenario-based) is proposed, in which a risk restriction constraint and reward-penalty mechanism are simultaneously considered. Two solution approaches, parallel enumeration method (PEM) and genetic algorithm (GA) are designed to solve the proposed model. The PEM is an exact solution approach and can rapidly obtain the global optimal solution of the proposed model by utilizing multiply processors. Finally, an application example is provided to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model and two solution approaches. The performance of PEM is evaluated by speedup radio. In addition, the sensitivity analyses about maximum acceptable risk and reward-penalty intensity are conducted, and some management insights for the government are obtained. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

"With a great emphasis on both social and environmental responsibilities, sustainable supply chain management has gradually been adopted and promoted as an innovative business model. In sustainable supply chain practice, the choice of sustainable suppliers relates to the long-term development of a company. While the environmental performance of suppliers has been commonly considered, the social dimension has not yet received enough attention. This paper first proposes a novel criteria system for evaluating sustainable suppliers from three aspects and six dimensions, and then introduces an integrated evaluation model with a novel hybrid information aggregation. To verify the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method, a real case of a large supermarket is introduced and analyzed. The research results show that (1) the indicator system based on Triple Bottom Line theory can serve as a framework of sustainable supplier selection for manufacturing and circulation enterprises; (2) the introduction of hybrid information aggregation can effectively handle the uncertainties of indicator scores under the realistic fuzzy environment and objectively reflect the intentions of the scorers; and (3) in comparison with the TOPSIS algorithm, the priority order finally obtained is consistent, but the proposed model shows more robustness in the sensitivity test.",An Integrated Sustainable Supplier Selection Approach Based on Hybrid Information Aggregation,sustainable supplier selection *** DEMATEL *** ANP *** fuzzy VIKOR *** IVTFN *** hybrid information aggregation *** TBL theory,sustainability,WOS:000440947600434,2018,,,,,,
"In the present paper, a robust approach is used to locate hub facilities considering network risks. An additional objective function, minimax regret, is added to the classical objective function in the hub location problem. In the proposed model, risk factors such as availability, security, delay time, environmental guidelines and regional air pollution are considered using triangular fuzzy-stochastic numbers. Then an equivalent crisp single objective model is proposed and solved by the Benders decomposition method. Finally, the results of both Benders decomposition and commercial optimization software are compared for different instances. Numerical instances were developed based on the well-known Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) data set, considering different levels of uncertainty in parameters. The results show that the proposed model is capable of selecting nodes as sustainable hubs. Also, the results confirm that using Benders decomposition is more efficient than using classical solution methods for large-scale problems.",ROBUST SOLUTION FOR A MINIMAX REGRET HUB LOCATION PROBLEM IN A FUZZY-STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENT,Hub location *** robust optimization *** minimax regret *** Benders decomposition algorithm,journal of industrial and management optimization,WOS:000438848400023,2018,,,,,,
"Bioenergy-based eco-industrial parks or bioenergy parks are integrated networks of biomass processing industries that optimally allocate products, by-products, waste, as well as common utilities in order to further improve sustainability. This multifunctional system produces high value products such as power, biochar, biochemicals, etc. alongside with the conventional biofuels (e.g., bioethanol). However, these networks are characterized as inherently vulnerable to cascading disruptions in cases of inoperability (i.e., reduction in production levels) of one or more of its component bioenergy plants. The inoperability of bioenergy plants can be caused by supply-side disruptions due to reductions in the available biomass feedstocks (i.e., caused by climate change-induced events) as well as due to seasonal variations in the demand for bioenergy products. It is therefore essential to incorporate these factors in the systematic risk analysis prior to designing of bioenergy parks. This work thus develops an extension to the P-graph based method for criticality analysis in bioenergy parks considering multiple supply-side and demand-side perturbation scenarios. Results show that the average net output reduction in the bioenergy park is higher for multiple plant disruption scenarios and criticality of bioenergy plants is greatly influenced by variations in product demands. The proposed method can be used in the long-term planning and developing of robust bioenergy parks while considering both uncertainties in the supply and demand. A bioenergy park case study is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the P-graph based approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

"In this paper, the problem of sustainable closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) design under multi-uncertainties is studied. To identify an efficient way to enhance environmental and operational benefits of CLSC, we use Big Data and propose data-driven approaches to generating robust CLSC designs that mitigate uncertainty and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions burdens. More specifically, in addressing multi-uncertainties (i.e., buyers' expectations, demands, and recovery uncertainties), a distributed robust optimization model (DRO) and an adaptive robust model (ARO) are developed for designing carryings and waste disposal facility locations of CLSC. Both models use historical data based on uncertain parameters for previous periods to make decisions on future stages in a robust way. Moreover, we incorporate K-L divergence into an ambiguous set of uncertain parameters to measure the value of data. The results of numerical analysis show the need to account for K-L divergence in an ambiguous set of DRO models, as GHG emission costs increase even when little K-L divergence disturbance is in place. Furthermore, from the data-driven framework, we find that government subsidies and an accurate estimation method (i.e., less K-L divergence) enhance environmental and operational benefits. Regarding model robustness levels, solutions generated from our ARO models outperform deterministic solutions not only in terms of their average objective value but also in terms of differences from ideal solutions.

"The level of uncertainty, unpredictability and complexity is magnified in a food supply chain as compared to the conventional supply chains such as automobile and FMCG. This is mainly because of the short product shelf life and the need of high variety. This necessitates the food industry to adopt various quick response systems to achieve effective supply chain management. The situation becomes even more critical when dealing with humanitarian relief operations where time window is very short (usually 24 hours). One of the solutions which are adopted in modern food supply chains is to locate cross-docking centre (CDC). Cross-docking is used to reduce the turnaround time of the food products. The practical situation is complex as it caters to multiple customers. The number of suppliers, in such cases, plays a significant role. Selection of a right CDC is, therefore, a crucial task. It is a strategic decision and needs to be taken by considering the relationships between each stakeholder present in the supply chain. In this article, we present an approach to select one (or few) CDC/s facilities among n CDCs. The method is based on the relationship between each actor (actors are the stakeholders in the supply chain). The relationship is in terms of the physical flow of materials or information flow or another kind of flows or relationships that connects them to form a network. These network characteristics are required to find out key stakeholders. The present article proposes the application of social network analysis (SNA) to analyse the characteristics of the network, thus helping supply chain managers to locate strategic CDCs considering both qualitative and quantitative aspects. The proposed methodology can be easily extended to locate temporary warehouse site in the context of humanitarian relief operations.",Cross-docking Centre Location in a Supply Chain Network: A Social Network Analysis Approach,Cross-docking centre (CDC) *** food supply chain *** humanitarian logistics (HL) *** social network analysis (SNA) *** supply chain network design *** supply chain relationship,global business review,WOS:000429806600014,2018,,,,,,
"Recently, offshore outsourcing has become extremely important for companies that compete worldwide. In many industries, only companies that manage to be competitive globally can aspire to attain sustainable competitive advantages. Therefore, offshore outsourcing has become essential for many companies and recently has become more and more a vital part of the long-term strategies of the leading firms. The rapidly shifting conditions in the marketplace is forcing management to constantly review and defend its core competencies. Management is now confronted with a higher level of complexity and disruptions brought about in particular by the new waves of globalization and the irresistible march of technological changes. For these reasons, offshore outsourcing is transforming the functions of the traditional firms into a network of competencies.

"This study considers a multi-objective combined budget constrained Facility Location/Network Design Problem (FL/NDP), in which system uncertainty is considered. The most obvious practical examples of the problem are territorial designing and locating of academies, airline networks, and medical service centers. In order to assure network reliability versus uncertainty, an efficient robust optimization approach is applied to model the proposed problem. The formulation is minimizing the total expected costs, including transshipment costs, Facility Location (FL) costs, and fixed cost of road/link utilization as well as minimizing the total penalties of uncovered demand nodes. Then, in order to consider several system uncertainties, the proposed model is changed to a fuzzy robust model by suitable approaches. An efficient sub-gradient based Lagrangian relaxation algorithm is applied. In addition, a practical example is studied. In the following, a series of experiments, including several test problems, is designed and solved to evaluate of the performance of the algorithm. The obtained results emphasize that considering practical factors (e.g. several uncertainties, system disruptions, and customer satisfaction) in modelling of the problem can lead to significant improvement of the system yield and, subsequently, more efficient utilization of the established network.

"This paper offers a critical assessment of the value and utility of the evolving City Region Food Systems (CRFS) approach to improve our insights into flows of resources-food, waste, people, and knowledge-from rural to peri-urban to urban and back again, and the policies and process needed to enable sustainability. This paper reflects on (1) CRFS merits compared to other approaches; (2) the operational potential of applying the CRFS approach to existing projects through case analysis; (3) how to make the CRFS approach more robust and ways to further operationalize the approach; and (4) the potential for the CRFS approach to address complex challenges including integrated governance, territorial development, metabolic flows, and climate change. The paper begins with the rationale for CRFS as both a conceptual framework and an integrative operational approach, as it helps to build increasingly coherent transformational food systems. CRFS is differentiated from existing approaches to understand the context and gaps in theory and practice. We then explore the strength of CRFS through the conceptual building blocks of 'food systems' and 'city-regions' as appropriate, or not, to address pressing complex challenges. As both a multi-stakeholder, sustainability-building approach and process, CRFS provides a collective voice for food actors across scales and could provide coherence across jurisdictions, policies, and scales, including the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact, the Sustainable Development Goals, the Habitat III New Urban Agenda, and the Conference of the Parties (COP) 21. CRFS responds directly to calls in the literature to provide a conceptual and practical framing for policy through wide engagement across sectors that enables the co-construction of a relevant policy frame that can be enacted through sufficiently integrated policies and programs that achieve increasingly sustainable food systems.","Validating the City Region Food System Approach: Enacting Inclusive, Transformational City Region Food Systems",city region *** food systems *** sustainability *** policy coherence,sustainability,WOS:000435587100376,2018,,,,,,
"Governments in developing countries often face the daunting task of designing a network of grain storage facilities to simultaneously benefit the various stakeholders (farmers, market traders, exporters, etc.) in the grain supply chain irrespective of the conflicting objectives of these stakeholders. Existing decision support systems either require data that are unavailable in most developing countries or have objectives irrelevant in the context of developing countries. This paper therefore develops a decision support system that integrates transportation, pseudo p-median, forecasting and goal programming models to optimally design networks of grain storage facilities to reduce the transportation cost of respective stakeholders. The effectiveness of the proposed decision support system has been demonstrated by comparing phantom networks developed with the decision support system to the Government of Ghana's network of 48 grain storage facilities.",Decision support system for designing sustainable multi-stakeholder networks of grain storage facilities in developing countries,Goal programming *** Grain storage facilities *** Warehouses *** Facility location *** Developing countries,computers and electronics in agriculture,WOS:000428828200014,2018,,,,,,
"Unlike their inherent advantageous features, photovoltaic systems have not yet penetrated the market adequately due to their high price against other electricity generation options. To propel this fledgling industry further towards commercialization, the efficient and effective design of its supply chain is of paramount importance. In this regard, this study proposes a hybrid robust-scenario based optimization model to design a resilient photovoltaic supply chain under both business-as-usual and hazard uncertainties. To capture business-as-usual uncertainty, a customized robust optimization method is developed, which is capable of tackling correlated uncertain parameters and adjusting the level of conservatism in the solutions. Likewise, a number of proactive and reactive resilience strategies are incorporated into the model to ameliorate the resilience level of the concerned supply chain in the presence of hazard uncertainty. The capabilities of the developed model are explored by discussing a real case study via which helpful managerial insights are gained. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

"Process sustainability is one of the major concerns in the process systems engineering area. Addressing this concept inevitably requires a multi-objective analysis to evaluate the social and environmental impacts in addition to the usual economic performance objective. Furthermore, the final sustainability of the proposed solutions very often depends on uncertain conditions, especially in the very frequent case that renewable resources are considered in order to enhance environmental sustainability: these resources are usually affected by unpredictable variations in their quality/quantity availability. But the approaches presented for solving multi-objective problems under uncertainty are limited by the amount of scenarios required to represent the unknown conditions. Here it is presented a solution strategy that combines a scenario reduction algorithm within the framework of a multi-objective formulation. Such a strategy is able to produce a fast and robust multi-objective optimization (MOO) while considering uncertainty in the raw material conditions (more precisely quality and availability). The solutions forming the resulting set of Pareto solutions are sorted hierarchically using the Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality IV (ELECTRE IV) method, which identifies the ones showing better overall performance considering the uncertain parameters space.

"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd This study aims to critically evaluate whether the implementation of selected green supply chain management (GSCM) practices will drive and empower sustainability among ISO14001-certified manufacturing firms in Malaysia. Besides this, the significance and strength of the relationships between GSCM practices and sustainability performance were also investigated and subsequently ranked using a two-stage PLS–ANN approach. Primary data was collected from 178 large ISO14001-certified Malaysian manufacturers through self-administered survey questionnaires. PLS–SEM using SmartPLS 3.0 and artificial neural network analysis (ANN) served as statistical analysis tools. This study draws out the prominence of GSCM practices as strategies to achieve sustainability performance. However, the relationship between supplier selection and supplier evaluation with sustainability performance is surprisingly insignificant. Furthermore, cooperation with customers is found to be significantly but negatively related to sustainability performance. Nevertheless, this contributes new knowledge to the literature with sensible justifications being offered accordingly.",A gateway to realising sustainability performance via green supply chain management practices: A PLS–ANN approach,Artificial neural network analysis (ANN) *** Green supply chain management (GSCM) *** Malaysia *** Manufacturers *** Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS–SEM) *** Sustainability performance,expert systems with applications,85045716523,2018,,,,,,

"© 2018, Springer Nature B.V. The costs associated with inspecting wind turbines are high due to their size and complexity. One potential method by which such costs can be reduced, is through the development of robust systems that can monitor the conditions of wind turbines remotely. This study proposes embedding sensors into wind turbines to monitor the conditions of the wind turbines throughout their life cycles. The information retrieved from these sensors could be helpful in two ways: It could facilitate the provision of predictive maintenance for the turbines and enhance the performance of end-of-life (EOL) processing operations. During the maintenance phase, sensors can help to predict failures before they occur because they provide condition information about the products. During the EOL processing phase, they help to improve disassembly and inspection operations. Therefore, the use of embedded sensors in wind turbines could potentially reduce maintenance costs and increase EOL profit. This study compares regular and sensor-embedded wind turbine systems, which are modeled using discrete event simulation. A design of experiments study was carried out on the models. During the experimental stage, while conducting experiments, key variables, such as maintenance cost, disassembly cost, inspection cost, and EOL profit, were monitored. At the analysis stage, pairwise t-tests were performed to determine the statistical significance of the results. The results stage revealed that sensors can provide significant benefits to closed-loop supply chain systems when they are embedded into wind turbines.",Maintenance and remanufacturing strategy: using sensors to predict the status of wind turbines,Closed-loop supply chain *** Maintenance *** Predictive maintenance *** Remanufacturing *** Sensor embedded products *** Wind turbines,journal of remanufacturing,85051872473,2018,,,,,,
"© 2017 Elsevier Ltd Pallets are fundamental assets critical to worldwide supply chain logistics. This research develops models for closed-loop pallet pooling providers to understand the environmental and economic impact of customer characteristics and design options. First, an analytical model is developed to quantify the effects of repair facility location and pallet service conditions on a pallet pooling system's economic and environmental performance. Next, a simulation model is developed to investigate two common operational policies, crossdocking and take-back, and to quantify the impact of pallet handling and loading conditions and customer network structures on several key performance indicators. Results indicate that pallet handling and loading conditions are the most important factors determining the cost and carbon equivalent emission of a pallet pooling operation. Better pallet handling and appropriate loading increase the percentage of pallets that can be repositioned with little or no repair. This increases the radius within which a closed-loop pallet pooling system is feasible. Under random handling/loading conditions and distances, a crossdocking approach satisfies demand with 28% fewer pallets than a take-back policy. This is due to a quicker reissue time under a crossdocking approach. However, associated costs and emissions of the two policies are nearly identical due to the increased transportation costs associated with crossdocking. The models and insights proposed in this work can help support decision making by pallet pooling providers to determine operational regions and customer selection, among other network design trade-offs.",Investigating the environmental and economic impact of loading conditions and repositioning strategies for pallet pooling providers,Carbon emissions *** Closed-loop logistics *** Pallet pooling *** Remanufacturing *** Repositioning *** Simulation,journal of cleaner production,85038871058,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: Approximately, 800m tons of e-waste is generated per year in India. Reverse supply chain (RSC) is the probable strategy to cope up with the issue. Setting up a RSC process is not popular in the Indian sector. There are several factors that basically control the profitability of such kind of business. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to develop a causal model among the identified issues and sub-issues for setting up a RSC in an Indian semiconductor manufacturing industry and then evaluate the critical issues based on the causal relations. Design/methodology/approach: Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method along fuzzy set theory is used to develop the causal framework among the identified strategical and tactical issues. According to the causal relations from DEMATEL, analytical network process is then used to identify the weights of the sub-issues. Findings: The cause–effect interactions among the main issues show that legislations and regulations, market-related issues and organizational issue are the most significant strategic issues. Uncertainty in the acquisition time is the most significant tactical issue because it has a crucial impact on the quality and quantity of the used products. Based on the obtained causal relations of the main issues, it is identified that the reduction of waste, creation of new opportunity, market competition, cost reduction, change in technology and location, capacity and number of recovery facility are the major sub-issues in RSC implementation. Practical implications: This study is conducted on the basis of the experts’ opinion from a semiconductor manufacturing industry, situated in the southern part of India. Therefore, this proves its practical implications. Originality/value: The paper provides the detail illustration of the issues in the RSC process, and the prioritization of the issues based on the cause–effect relationships also provides some meaningful managerial insights.",Developing a causal model to evaluate the critical issues in reverse supply chain implementation,ANP *** DEMATEL *** Fuzzy set theory *** Reverse supply chain *** Sustainability,benchmarking,85053708934,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 Haizhou Tang et al. Urban power supply network plays a vital role in maintaining the city operation. The vulnerability of power supply network in the face of events has been one of significant concerns. This study presents a new methodology and framework for ""dose-response"" vulnerability assessment of urban power supply network. This framework can explore the vulnerability of power supply network under two types of events: random type and intentional type. It also integrates a new metric that calculates the vulnerability of power supply network in both structural dimension and functional dimension. Taking the power supply network of a city in east China as an example, network vulnerability under different types of events was assessed, and the ""dose-response"" interrelationships between network performance and event scale under different types of events were thoroughly discussed. The results demonstrated that power supply network was more vulnerable to intentional events in both dimensions. For intentional events, power supply network was more vulnerable to degree-based attack than to betweenness-based attack. After that, the redundancy coefficient α of power supply network was optimized. The conclusion and some suggestions for future research were given in the end.","""dose-Response"" Vulnerability Assessment of Urban Power Supply Network: Foundation for Its Sustainability and Resilience", ,mathematical problems in engineering,85059681252,2018,,,,,,

"© 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: The competitiveness of mining regions largely depends on the performance of the regional supply chains that provide services to mining companies. These local supply chains are often highly intertwined and represent a regional supply network for the industry. Individual companies often use supply chain strategies that are sub-optimal to overall supply network performance. To effectively respond to an uncertain business environment, policy-makers and supply chain participants would benefit by a governance framework that would allow to incentivise the formation of supply networks structures enabling effective operations. The purpose of this paper is to offer an empirically grounded conceptual framework based on Complex Adaptive Systems (CASs) governance principles, which links network governance mechanisms with supply network structure and operational performance to incentivise the formation of adaptive and resilient supply networks in the mining industry. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed method research design and a case study of the South Australian mining sector were used to collect empirical data. Qualitative interviews and network analysis of the SA mining industry regional supply network structure were conducted. The relationships between network parameters were interpreted using CAS theory. Findings: An empirically grounded conceptual framework based on CAS governance principles is developed. The case study revealed that supply chain strategies and governance mechanisms in the SA mining industry have led to the formation of a hierarchical, scale-free structure with insufficient horizontal connectivity which limits the adaptability, responsiveness and resilience of the regional supply network. Research limitations/implications: The findings are drawn from a single case study. This limits generalisability of the findings and the proposed framework. Practical implications: The proposed framework draws the attention of the policy-makers and supply chain participants towards the need for utilising CAS governance principles to facilitate the formation of adaptive, responsive and resilient regional supply networks in the mining industry.

"© 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  &  Francis Group. Green supply chain management (GSCM) involves consideration of environmental impacts of all the processes involved in a typical supply chain to minimise their negative consequences. In this paper, we present a DEMATEL-based approach for investigating barriers in GSCM in Canadian context. Seven manufacturing firms from electronic goods sector are involved. The results of our study yield three main categories of barriers. These barriers are knowledge-related (lack of awareness of the environmental impacts on business, lack of training courses/consultancy/institutions to train, monitor/mentor progress specific to each industry, lack of technical expertise and difficulty in identifying environmental opportunities), commitment-related (lack of corporate social responsibility) and product design-related (complexity of design to reuse/recycle used products). The proposed study is one of the first few to be conducted in the Canadian context for green supply chain barrier analysis for electronic goods sector. Secondly, the barriers are investigated through causality and prominence relations which can help decision-makers, policy planners and managers of organisations in addressing those critical few for making green supply chain practices a success.",A DEMATEL based approach for investigating barriers in green supply chain management in Canadian manufacturing firms,barriers *** DEMATEL *** green supply chain management *** multicriteria decision-making *** supply chain management *** sustainability *** sustainable supply chain,international journal of production research,85032705676,2018,,,,,,
"© 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  &  Francis Group. In our increasingly volatile world, very unlikely events, so-called black swans, occur more often, inflicting massive damage on production environments. But there are also so-called grey swan events, equally destructive, but not utterly unpredictable. They have already occurred in the past, perhaps in related production settings. We present a dynamic model that analyses how grey swan events originate in supply networks and how they can be prevented. Most of the literature so far has focused on external risks, beyond the scope of managerial control. This paper introduces a formal model in which a central role is played by management and its inability to observe and act timely on signals of growing operational issues which cause grey swan events. The paper starts with an empirical investigation of one grey swan event, the Airbus A380 introduction. Our model can replicate this type of grey swan behaviour. With this model, we conduct a system dynamics analysis of the mechanisms that can create or prevent a particular type of grey swan event, a business tsunami. The level of managerial preparedness to actively ‘search for the grey swans’ is found to be a key prerequisite to prevent destructive impact on production supply networks. Our paper suggests ways in which the field of production research can help foster such structurally high managerial preparedness.",A dynamic model of managerial response to grey swan events in supply networks,disruption management *** grey swans events *** management decision-making *** supply chain disruptions *** supply chain dynamics *** supply networks *** system dynamics,international journal of production research,85032687770,2018,,,,,,
"© 2017 Elsevier Ltd The screening of sustainable agro-industrial biorefinery pathways for the production of bio-based products and energy is a complex challenge and needs investigation. Critical tools for predicting the commercialization feasibility of biorefining pathway includes laboratory and pilot-scale experimental results, processes modeling, technoeconomic and market analysis. The objective of the present study was the potential pathways experimental proof of concept of the sunflower meal (SFM), by-product in the sunflower oil production process, at TRL3-4 level, in an effort to assist the bio-based industries in evaluating the profitability of different possible production routes and product portfolios. Taking a reflexive approach, various processes and products were investigated, adding insights in the technical feasibility of conversion towards multi-product pathways at lab scale. Many sets of experiments were conducted in two laboratories, investigating SFM biorefining using physical, biological and thermochemical processes (fractionation, fermentation, enzymatic hydrolysis and pyrolysis) for the production of various added-value products, biochar and energy carriers. Product yields, mass balances, Effective Mass Yield (EMY) and Feature Complexity (FC) were estimated for each pathway. The study demonstrated that SFM cascade refining concept is feasible leading to the production of antioxidants, protein isolate, biochar, bioenergy carriers (pyro-oil and pyro-gas) and also poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) and microbial oil with a Feature Complexity (FC): 6-7. The studied pathways were based on the principle of optimised resource utilisation. Pyrolytic chars showed suitable for soil amendment, thus, closing the loop in agriculture (from land-to-land).

"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd Ports are key elements of global supply chains, providing connection between land- and maritime-based transportation modes. They operate in cooperative, but competitive, co-opetitive, environments wherein individual port throughput is linked through an underlying transshipment network. Short-term port performance and long-term market share can be significantly impacted by a disaster event; thus, ports plan to invest in capacity expansion and protective measures to increase their reliability or resiliency in times of disruption. To account for the co-opetition among ports, a bi-level multiplayer game theoretic approach is used, wherein each individual port takes protective investment decisions while anticipating the response of the common market-clearing shipping assignment problem in the impacted network. This lower-level assignment is modeled as a cost minimization problem, which allows for consideration of gains and losses from other ports decisions through changes in port and service capacities and port cargo handling times. Linear properties of the lower-level formulation permit reformulation of the individual port bi-level optimization problems as single-level problems by replacing the common lower-level by its equivalent Karush Kuhn Tucker (KKT) conditions. Simultaneous consideration of individual port optimization problems creates a multi-leader, common-follower problem, i.e. an unrestricted game, that is modeled as an Equilibrium Problem with Equilibrium Constraints (EPEC). Equilibria solutions are sought by use of a diagonalization technique. Solutions of unrestricted, semi-restricted and restricted games are analyzed and compared for a hypothetical application from the literature involving ports in East Asia and Europe. The proposed co-opetitive approach was found to lead to increased served total demand, significantly increased market share for many ports and improved services for shippers.","Co-opetition in enhancing global port network resiliency: A multi-leader, common-follower game theoretic approach",Co-opetition *** Complementarity optimization *** Freight transportation protection *** Game theory *** Multi-leader common-follower *** Port resiliency *** Protective infrastructure investment planning,transportation research part b: methodological,85044387016,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. Today’s complex supply chains are increasingly susceptible to the turbulent and fast-changing business environment and their economic implications. Resilience as an effective strategic planning during disturbances is a way to mitigate supply chain vulnerabilities. After reviewing the literature on the topic of a resilient supply chain, this paper extracts a complete series of 16 resilience enablers. These identified enablers form the foundation of a questionnaire distributed among over 150 experts and staffs of a real case associated with an Iranian automotive supply chain. The reliability and validity of the questionnaire are evaluated by statistical tests and Cronbach’s alpha. Then, a hybrid of the Z-number data envelopment analysis and neural network is employed for the efficiency score calculation, separately. Finally, the associated results are combined and the final efficiency scores are obtained. The case study findings indicate that by improving the resilience enablers, especially ones with the greatest influence on the supply chain performance, firms can be less vulnerable in times of supply chain disruptions. The framework proposed in this study may find a broad practical application in all types of supply chains.",A hybrid Z-number data envelopment analysis and neural network for assessment of supply chain resilience: a case study,Automotive supply chain *** Neural network *** Supply chain resilience *** Vulnerability *** Z-numbers data envelopment analysis,central european journal of operations research,85057953043,2018,,,,,,
"© 2017 The Authors Maritime port infrastructures rely on the use of information systems for collaboration, while a vital part of collaborating is to provide protection to these systems. Attack graph analysis and risk assessment provide information that can be used to protect the assets of a network from cyber-attacks. Furthermore, attack graphs provide functionality that can be used to identify vulnerabilities in a network and how these can be exploited by potential attackers. Existing attack graph generation methods are inadequate in satisfying certain requirements necessary in a dynamic supply chain risk management environment, since they do not consider variables that assist in exploring specific network parts that satisfy certain criteria, such as the entry and target points, the propagation length and the location and capability of the potential attacker. In this paper, we present a cyber-attack path discovery method that is used as a component of a maritime risk management system. The method uses constraints and Depth-first search to effectively generate attack graphs that the administrator is interested in.

"© 2013 IEEE. Urban water supply network is ubiquitous and indispensable to city dwellers, especially in the era of global urbanization. Preventative maintenance of water pipes, especially in urban-scale networks, thus becomes a vital importance. To achieve this goal, failure prediction that aims to pro-actively pinpoint those 'most-risky-to-fail' pipes becomes critical and has been attracting wide attention from government, academia, and industry. Different from classification-, regression-, or ranking-based methods, this paper adopts a point process-based framework that incorporates both the past failure event data and individual pipe-specific profile including physical, environmental, and operational covariants. In particular, based on a common wisdom of previous work that the failure event sequences typically exhibit temporal clustering distribution, we use mutual-exciting point process to model such triggering effects for different failure types. Our system is deployed as a platform commissioned by the water agency in a metropolitan city in Asia, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on an urban-scale pipe network. Our model is generic and thus can be applied to other industrial scenarios for event prediction.",Dynamic modeling of failure events in preventative pipe maintenance,event series modeling *** pipe failure prediction *** Point process,ieee access,85042102500,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd The assessment of biomass at high spatial resolution is critical to manage supply risks and to identify optimal plant sites for producing sustainable biofuels and co-products. The spatial variabilities in soil type, topography, climate, and crop management practices further require vast computational time and resources to estimate the availability of sustainable biomass for a large study area. In this study, we developed a GIS-based integrated predictive modeling platform to assess the availability of sustainable crop residues at high spatial (30 m) and temporal (2010–2022) scales. A GIS-based multi-criteria inclusion-exclusion analysis and facility location-allocation models were used to identify suitable sites, and optimal siting of biogas plants respectively with biomass delivered cost. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based predictive models were well suited to predict sustainability indicators (soil erosion SE- R2 = 0.96, soil conditioning index, SCI– R2 = 0.98 and organic matter factor, OMF- R2 = 0.83) for assessing sustainable removal rates of crop residues (corn stover and wheat straw). The GIS-based integrated model was applied to the State of Ohio and found that about 4–13 dry Tg of crop residues can be sustainably available to build 1–25 regional biogas plants. A typical optimal biogas plant with a feedstock capacity of up to 500 dry Gg could be drawn from a transport radius of about 19–35 km with a delivered cost of 40–46 $ dry Mg−1.

"© 2017, The Author(s). This study investigates the reliable multi-configuration capacitated logistics network design problem (RMCLNDP) under system disturbances, which relates to locating facilities, establishing transportation links, and also allocating their limited capacities to the customers conducive to provide their demand on the minimum expected total cost (including locating costs, link constructing costs, and also expected costs in normal and disturbance conditions). In addition, two types of risks are considered; (I) uncertain environment, (II) system disturbances. A two-level mathematical model is proposed for formulating of the mentioned problem. Also, because of the uncertain parameters of the model, an efficacious possibilistic robust optimization approach is utilized. To evaluate the model, a drug supply chain design (SCN) is studied. Finally, an extensive sensitivity analysis was done on the critical parameters.

We show that nitrogen balance-the difference between nitrogen inputs and nitrogen outputs in an agricultural production system-is a robust measure of nitrogen losses that is simple to calculate, easily understood, and based on readily available farm data. Nitrogen balance provides farmers with a means of demonstrating to an increasingly concerned public that they are succeeding in reducing nitrogen losses while also improving the overall sustainability of their farming operation. Likewise, supply-chain companies and policymakers can use nitrogen balance to track progress toward sustainability goals. We describe the value of nitrogen balance in translating environmental targets into actionable goals for farmers and illustrate the potential roles of science, policy, and agricultural support networks in helping farmers achieve them.",The Nitrogen Balancing Act: Tracking the Environmental Performance of Food Production,agricultural production *** environmental outcomes *** nitrogen balance *** nitrogen pollution *** supply chain,bioscience,85042926317,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 by the authors. Today's supply chains (SCs) are more than ever prone to disruptions caused by natural and man-made events with water scarcity identified as one of the highest impact events among these. Leading businesses, understanding that natural resource scarcity (NRS) has become a critical supply chain risk factor, extensively incorporate sustainable water management programmes into their corporate social responsibility and environmental management agenda. The question of how industries can efficiently evaluate the progress of these water scarcity mitigation practices, however, remains open. In order to address this question, the present study proposes a conceptual maturity model. The model is rooted in strategies for water scarcity mitigation using a framework developed by Yatskovskaya and Srai and develops an extensive literature review of recent publications on maturity frameworks in the fields of sustainability and operations management. In order to test the proposed proposed, model an exploratory case study with a leading pharmaceutical company was conducted. The proposed maturity model presents an evaluation tool that allows systematic assessment and visualisation of organisational routines and practices relevant to sustainable manufacturing in the context of water scarcity. This model was designed to help illustrate mitigation capabilities evolution over time, where future state desired capabilities were considered through alternative supply network (SN) configurations, network structure, process flow, product architecture, and supply partnerships.",Integrated supply network maturity model: Water scarcity perspective,Maturity model *** Mitigation capabilities *** Sustainable supply networks *** Water scarcity,sustainability (switzerland),85044215657,2018,,,,,,
"Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd. In a multi-tier supply network, sourcing strategy, consisting of supplier selection (SS) and order quantity allocation (OQA) to selected supplier(s), is a critical and challenging task for practitioners. Every player, in every tier of sourcing network, attempts to select quality conscious suppliers and optimise its own inventory cost per unit time for OQA. However, this may results in sub-optimal solution(s) for overall multi-tier supply network. Considering centralised sourcing strategy for SS and OQA may provide global best solution and sustainable supply network. This paper attempts to quantitatively illustrate inventory cost saving for coordinated centralised sourcing strategy for all tiers compared to independent decentralised sourcing strategy at individual tier in the supply network. Suitable mathematical models (single and multi-tier) and corresponding solution framework is used to determine local optima and global best solution for a comparative analysis. A real life electric goods manufacturing industry case study is used to demonstrate significant cost advantage for a centralised as compared to decentralised sourcing strategy.

"© 2018 Tirazheh Zare-Garizy et al. Globalization and outsourcing are two main factors which are leading to higher complexity of supply chain networks. Due to the strategic importance of having a sustainable network, it is necessary to have an enhanced supply chain network risk management. In a supply chain network many firms depend directly or indirectly on a specific supplier. In this regard, unknown risks of network's structure can endanger the whole supply chain network's robustness. In spite of the importance of risk identification of supply chain network, firms are not willing to exchange the structural information of their network. Firms are concerned about risking their strategic positioning or established connections in the network. The paper proposes to combine secure multiparty computation cryptography methods with risk identification algorithms from social network analysis to address this challenge. The combination enables structural risk identification of supply chain networks without endangering firms' competitive advantage.",A Privacy Preserving Approach to Collaborative Systemic Risk Identification: The Use-Case of Supply Chain Networks, ,security and communication networks,85051346969,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 A revolution in manufacturing systems is underway: substantial recent investment has been directed towards the development of smart manufacturing systems that are able to respond in real time to changes in customer demands, as well as the conditions in the supply chain and in the factory itself. Smart manufacturing is a key component of the broader thrust towards Industry 4.0, and relies on the creation of a bridge between digital and physical environments through Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, coupled with enhancements to those digital environments through greater use of cloud systems, data analytics and machine learning. Whilst these individual technologies have been in development for some time, their integration with industrial systems leads to new challenges as well as potential benefits. In this paper, we explore the challenges faced by those wishing to secure smart manufacturing systems. Lessons from history suggest that where an attempt has been made to retrofit security on systems for which the primary driver was the development of functionality, there are inevitable and costly breaches. Indeed, today's manufacturing systems have started to experience this over the past few years; however, the integration of complex smart manufacturing technologies massively increases the scope for attack from adversaries aiming at industrial espionage and sabotage. The potential outcome of these attacks ranges from economic damage and lost production, through injury and loss of life, to catastrophic nation-wide effects. In this paper, we discuss the security of existing industrial and manufacturing systems, existing vulnerabilities, potential future cyber-attacks, the weaknesses of existing measures, the levels of awareness and preparedness for future security challenges, and why security must play a key role underpinning the development of future smart manufacturing systems.",Security of smart manufacturing systems,Cyber-physical systems *** Design for manufacturing *** Information security *** Internet of Things *** Smart manufacturing *** Sustainable manufacturing,journal of manufacturing systems,85045653026,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd. Security and risk management in warehouses and logistics is a key factor to achieve a sustainable and safe supply chain. The paper aims at proposing RFID-IoT-enabled warehouse management focused on safety assurance for goods and people leveraging product class-based storage (pCBS), communicating object, RFID and IoT components. Security issues between products, storage locations, transportation equipment, environment and people are handled with the use of potential fields methods associated with smart product management in RFID-IoT warehouse architecture. A dynamic calculation of suitable storage locations is proposed, founded on negotiation mechanisms between products and shelves and their availability and compatibility constraints according to pCBS method. A safe and secure product storage path discovery method is presented using attractive/repulsive potential fields for path minimisation while maximising security level along the way.

"© 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide an analysis of a major retailer’s transition to omnichannel retailing (OCR) from an existing multichannel retailing (MCR) base. Using the illustrative case of Seven & I (S&I) Holdings, the paper positions OCR in terms of its goal to provide added customer value through a seamless brand experience. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses a case study methodology, based on a series of in-depth interviews. Executives at S&I were interviewed as the core of the case, and supporting interviews were carried out with executives at Yamato Transport, Inditex Japan and Rakuten. Data collected in interviews were cross-referenced to industry and trade press reports, providing an illustration of the motivation and strategic decisions behind the transition to OCR, and of factors that have direct impact on the implementation of the model. Findings: The results illustrate the difficulty in achieving OCR in terms of unifying customer experience across multiple channels. The case demonstrates the potential for cross-channel integration through multiple, but integrated touchpoints, and the leveraging of existing multichannel retail infrastructure and systems. In addition to confirming previous conceptual understanding of the transition process, the core findings demonstrate the importance of the strategic implementation process, the importance of the retailer’s brand portfolio and brand management, and the need to adjust and leverage existing facilities and infrastructure. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited by the single case employed, although the complexity of OCR implementation does not take away from the practical implications in a broader sense. It could be argued that the Japanese retail industry has some differences to other markets, but the customer-orientated nature of S&I’s implementation, and its aim to leverage existing infrastructure, is illustrative for similar strategies of retailers elsewhere in the world. Practical implications: The study has value to both researchers and practitioners as a structured synopsis of an actual case of transition, and adds to the literature that relates to OCR and to Japanese distribution. It demonstrates not only the need for robust supply chain, logistics, IT, marketing and retail infrastructure, and integration across distribution systems, but also the importance of the retailer’s brand portfolio, which may need significant adjustment to best promote added customer value. The success of S&I is predicated on both the high population densities, characteristic of the Japanese market, and a strong, longstanding MCR base. Similar systems and implementation issues apply to other markets that operate under similar conditions. Social implications: The social implications of the paper relate to the fact that, although the transition to OCR may be a difficult, costly, and time-consuming proposition for a retailer, increasingly consumers are coming to expect both informational and purchasing options for brands to be available as, when and where they want them. The 24-7 nature of omnichannel also generates significant challenges in terms of work volumes and environmental impact. These issues are touched upon this paper. Originality/value: This paper provides a case of a major and well-known retailer and the transition process towards an OCR model, of which there are currently few case studies available. It also adds significantly to the body of literature relating to Japanese distribution and provides insights into strategy not generally known in the English-speaking world.",Build touchpoints and they will come: transitioning to omnichannel retailing,Convenience stores *** Japanese distribution *** Multichannel retailing *** Omnichannel retailing *** Seven Eleven,international journal of physical distribution and logistics management,85045456789,2018,,,,,,
"© 2016 Elsevier B.V. Innovative and efficient use of municipal solid waste as a source of energy is an important way to promote the transition to low-carbon cities. One key strategy to improve energy efficiency is to create a network of multiple sectors that can produce and utilize energy from waste. This mechanism has already been adopted at the urban scale in several developed countries as a way to enhance environmental efficiency and reduce adverse impacts. However, to use waste efficiently, it is necessary to examine the supply chain of wastes as a source of materials with potential to generate energy. Such an examination can inform the design of an efficient waste-to-energy process that will create a symbiosis between industry and the waste management sector. In this paper, we describe a model that evaluates energy recovery efficiency by considering the costs and benefits of an innovative waste-to-energy system. In the model, we also consider the material and energy flow of wastes in accordance with the quantity and quality of waste emissions, the separation system, treatment technologies and combinations thereof, and energy recovery and use in other sectors. The scenario was designed by identifying waste management options, including waste quantity/quality; the separation system; the treatment technology model for wet or dry methane fermentation; incineration; a combined system that involves superheating with exchanging heat between the incineration plant and fermenter; and use of refuse paper and plastic fuel (RPF). The results revealed that energy recovery efficiency was most dependent on the effective use of RPF with a relatively high lower heating value and superheating of boiler steam by methane gas in the combined system. An important conclusion was that the most efficient system was a combined system in which paper, plastic, and RPF were separated from 80% of the waste, and 20% of the waste was incinerated and used for wet methane fermentation. The amounts of energy recovered from that system was 54.5 kWh/t, and the efficiency was 33.4%. Analytical results indicated that it is possible to create the critical technology and to develop policy insights needed to make efficient waste management systems for the transition to low-carbon cities.",Efficient energy recovery through a combination of waste-to-energy systems for a low-carbon city,Energy recovery *** Industrial symbiosis *** Methane fermentation *** Waste management *** Waste-to-energy,"resources, conservation and recycling",85034079990,2018,,,,,,

"© 2017 Society of Chemical Industry Food losses and waste have always been a significant global problem for mankind, and one which has become increasingly recognised as such by policy makers, food producers, processors, retailers, and consumers. It is, however, an emotive subject whereby the extent, accuracy and resolution of available data on postharvest loss and waste are questionable, such that key performance indicators on waste can be misinformed. The nature and extent of food waste differ among developed economies, economies in transition and developing countries. While most emphasis has been put on increasing future crop production, far less resource has been and is still channelled towards enabling both established and innovative food preservation technologies to reduce food waste while maintaining safety and quality. Reducing food loss and waste is a more tractable problem than increasing production in the short to medium term, as its solution is not directly limited, for instance, by available land and water resources. Here we argue the need for a paradigm shift of current funding strategies and research programmes that will encourage the development, implementation and translation of collective biological, engineering and management solutions to better preserve and utilise food. Such multidisciplinary thinking across global supply chains is an essential element in the pursuit of achieving sustainable food and nutritional security. The implementation of allied technological and management solutions is reliant on there being sufficient skilled human capital and resources. There is currently a lack of robust postharvest research networks outside of the developed world, and insufficient global funding mechanisms that can support such interdisciplinary collaborations. There is, thus, a collective need for schemes that encourage inter-supply chain research, knowledge exchange and capacity building to reduce food losses and waste. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.",Minimising food waste: a call for multidisciplinary research,food security *** fresh produce *** postharvest loss *** sustainability,journal of the science of food and agriculture,85032740045,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 Ribeiro et al. Background: Although water and sanitation are considered human rights, worldwide approximately three of 10 people (2.1 billion) do not have access to safe drinking water. In 2016, 5.6 million students were enrolled in the 34% of Brazilian schools located in rural areas, but only 72% had a public water supply network. The objective was to evaluate effectiveness of environmental intervention for water treatment in rural schools of the Western Amazonia, and determine the efficacy of water treatment using a simplified chlorinator on potability standards for turbidity, fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli. Methods: A simplified chlorinator was installed for treatment of potable water in 20 public schools in the rural area of Rio Branco municipality, Acre state, Brazil. Results: Before the intervention, 20% (n = 4), 100% (n = 20) and 70% (n = 14) of schools had water that failed to meet potability standards for turbidity, fecal coliforms and E. coli, respectively. However, after intervention, 70% (p = 0.68), 75% (p < 0.001) and 100% (p < 0.001) of schools complied with potability standards. Discussion: This intervention considerably improved schools' water quality, thus decreasing children's health vulnerability due to inadequate water. Ancillary activities including training, educational lectures, installation of equipment, supply of materials and supplies (65% calcium hypochlorite and reagents) were considered fundamental to achieving success full outcomes. Installation of a simplified chlorinator in rural schools of the Western Amazon is therefore proposed as a social technology aiming at social inclusion, as well as economic and environmental sustainability.",Drinking water and rural schools in the Western Amazon: An environmental intervention study,Drinking water *** Escherichia coli *** Intervention study *** Schools *** Water quality,peerj,85048540084,2018,,,,,,

Major accidents involving dangerous substances pose a serious threat to the health and safety of local communities and the environment, as well as to the integrity and development of infrastructure where Seveso establishments are located. In some cases, the disastrous effects may affect larger, even cross-border areas. At European level, there are continuous efforts to develop land-use planning policies and regulations to reduce consequences and to prevent future accidents from happening. Hence, research in this field comes to support the current actions and strategies of the European Commission to improve the capacity of the EU Member States to cope with and respond to the identified risks through effective prevention, preparedness and response measures. In Romania, the Seveso establishments are mostly located in or very close to urban areas. This paper analyses vulnerability in case of two different accident scenarios (explosion and toxic dispersion) in Targu-Mures, a city hosting one of the largest Seveso upper-tier establishments in Romania. The approach starts with exposure analysis - the first step in the process of vulnerability analysis - which identifies all the elements at risk, be they social (population, medical facilities, schools), environmental (protected areas, water bodies) or economic (transport infrastructure, buildings, utility and water supply networks, fuel or food storage facilities). Following the exposure analysis, vulnerability is assessed based on indicators selected in such way so that they cover the entire range of social, economic, environmental aspects, as well as the existing response capabilities in case of a major accident.",Vulnerability analysis for two accident scenarios at an upper-tier seveso establishment in Romania,Chemical accident *** Dangerous substances *** Exposure *** Seveso establishments *** Vulnerability,geographia technica,85044732063,2018,,,,,,
"Copyright © 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l. The P-graph framework was originally developed to address Process Network Synthesis (PNS) problems in the preliminary design of chemical plants. P-graph provides a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient framework for solving PNS problems via the maximal structure generation (MSG), solution structure generation (SSG) and accelerated branch-and-bound (ABB) algorithms. MSG ensures rigorous generation of the maximal structure, while the ad hoc generation of a superstructure as basis for a mathematical programming model can lead to significant modelling errors. In addition, SSG allows the generation of combinatorially feasible network structures that can be utilized for practical decision-making by designers. For very large problems, ABB can reduce the computational effort of reaching globally optimal solutions by multiple orders of magnitude compared to conventional branch-and-bound solvers for Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models. In addition to conventional PNS problems, P-graph has been applied to the optimization of separation processes, Heat Exchanger Networks (HENs), Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems, chemical reaction pathways, polygeneration plants, biorefineries, and supply chains. Further non-conventional applications have also been reported, such as the optimisation of office processes, human resource networks, and economic structures at the level of cities or regions. In addition to synthesis and design problems, P-graph has also been applied to operational problems, such as determining the best abnormal operating conditions for process networks. These diverse applications suggest the potential for applying the P-graph framework as a problem-solving strategy for a broad class of generalized process networks, beyond the traditional PNS problems in chemical plant design. This paper surveys recent trends in the P-graph literature and uses bibliometric analysis to identify promising trends and discusses potential directions for novel applications for optimization of generalized process networks, particularly for applications that address critical sustainability issues.",Towards generalized process networks: Prospective new research frontiers for the p-graph framework, ,chemical engineering transactions,85051317524,2018,,,,,,
"Copyright © 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l. Hazardous chemicals have their own intrinsic properties such as explosive, flammable, corrosive, toxicity, and radioactivity, which will lead to great threats and substantial security risks in the transportation, application and storage processes. Problems, if possibly arisen in the transportation and management processes, may cause a major accident. We have to fight through some troubles in the whole process. For this purpose, the paper designs and implements a chemical logistics supervision and forewarning system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) cloud computing, which integrates IoT technology to collect, merge and transmit geographical location information and operation conditions for chemical supply chain such as storage and distribution, environmental parameters for hazardous chemicals, monitor and analyze the transportation route safety and driver operation status. This is a real-time surveillance over the whole logistics chain for hazardous chemicals. Here analyze and aggregate the parameter thresholds of the feature elements that lead the hazardous chemicals logistics to accidents. When the platform detects there is a parameter that reaches the critical threshold, the system automatically issues a warning signal according to the preset forewarning decision program, and then takes measures for level-to-level troubleshooting against it, thereby realizing the monitoring and forewarning on the hazardous chemicals logistics. It is proved by the test that the function modules on the platform all fill the bill for the design and implementation. Given the above, this platform can well apply to monitoring and early warning for hazardous chemicals logistics.",Implementation of chemicals logistics supervision forewarning platform based on iot cloud computing, ,chemical engineering transactions,85059756221,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018, Zahir Irani and Amir M. Sharif. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the use, applicability and relevance of strategic planning as a process and tool when applied to exploring food security challenges, in the context of existing research on food security and food waste in the food supply chain. The issues associated with robust and resilient food supply chains within a circular economy are increasingly being seen as supportive of creating enhanced levels of food security but the authors argue that this is only sustainable when strategically planned as part of a cross-enterprise, information-rich and complex supply chain. The relevance of the Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal and Environmental (PESTLE) strategic planning tool is explored to establish whether it can play a role tacking the complexity of food insecurity (i.e. a lack of food security). Design/methodology/approach: This is a viewpoint piece therefore as a result, thought, normative literature and supposition are used as a means to ground and orientate the views of the authors. Findings: The authors identify and conclude that strategic planning tools like PESTLE across enterprises may not be relevant in supporting the reduction of food insecurity. This conclusion is predicated on the heightened level of complexity surrounding the pursuit of food security and the simplistic categorisation of PESTLE factors in a linear fashion that underpin this tool. Rather, the authors’ call for the use of strategic planning tools that are able to capture a large number of inter-related factors holistically. Practical implications: This insight to the inter-related factors that contribute to food insecurity will allow policy developers, decision makers and others to develop their understanding of how strategic planning can support increased levels of food security within a circular economy and across cross-enterprises. Originality/value: The authors contribute to the literature through a new insight of how normative strategic planning tools need to evolve in a complex, inter-connected world of international business and geo-politics. In doing so, it is expected that this research will motivate others to develop their line of enquiry around uncovering and exploring those inter-relationships connecting PESTLE factors.","Food security across the enterprise: a puzzle, problem or mess for a circular economy?",Circular economy *** Food security *** Food supply chain *** Food waste *** Strategic planning,journal of enterprise information management,85041546969,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018, Jamie Stone and Shahin Rahimifard. Purpose: Resilience in agri-food supply chains (AFSCs) is an area of significant importance due to growing supply chain volatility. While the majority of research exploring supply chain resilience has originated from a supply chain management perspective, many other disciplines (such as environmental systems science and the social sciences) have also explored the topic. As complex social, economic and environmental constructs, the priority of resilience in AFSCs goes far beyond the company specific focus of supply chain management works and would conceivably benefit from including more diverse academic disciplines. However, this is hindered by inconsistencies in terminology and the conceptual components of resilience across different disciplines. The purpose of this study is to use a systematic literature review to identify which multidisciplinary aspects of resilience are applicable to AFSCs and to generate a novel AFSC resilience framework. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a structured and multidisciplinary review of 137 articles in the resilience literature followed by critical analysis and synthesis of findings to generate new knowledge in the form of a novel AFSC resilience framework. Findings: Findings indicate that the complexity of AFSCs and subsequent exposure to almost constant external interference means that disruptions cannot be seen as a one-off event; thus, resilience must concern the ability to not only maintain core function but also adapt to changing conditions. Practical implications: A number of resilience elements can be used to enhance resilience, but their selection and implementation must be carefully matched to relevant phases of disruption and assessed on their broader supply chain impacts. In particular, the focus must be on overall impact on the ability of the supply chain as a whole to provide food security rather than to boost individual company performance. Originality/value: The research novelty lies in the utilisation of wider understandings of resilience from various research fields to propose a rigorous and food-specific resilience framework with end consumer food security as its main focus.",Resilience in agri-food supply chains: a critical analysis of the literature and synthesis of a novel framework,Food industry *** Food security *** Resilience *** Supply chain disruptions *** Sustainability *** Systematic literature review,supply chain management,85044571090,2018,,,,,,

"Copyright © 2018 Xianglan Jiang et al. Sustainable supply chain network design has attracted great attention of academia and industry in recent years. Baijiu is one of the world's oldest distilled alcoholic beverages and plays a significant role in Chinese culture and Chinese people's daily life. As the production and consumption of Baijiu have a significant influence on the economic, environmental, and social performance of supply chainmanagement, sustainable supply chain network design decisions are critical to the long-term success of the industry. In concertwith the rapidly growing Chinese economy, there is a growing demand for a sustainable Baijiu industry. Therefore, this paper constructs and optimizes a network decision-support model for a sustainable Baijiu industry network design. To achieve this, the Baijiu supply chain is examined and a model is proposed for a design that encompasses economic (costs), environmental (carbon emissions), and social (local employment and regional per capita GDP) dimensions. R language programming is then applied to solve the model. A case example indicated that S1 was the optimal decision for reducing costs, S2 was the optimal solution for minimizing carbon emissions, and S3 was the best for maximizing the social impact. Considering the situation of the Baijiu industry and the focal enterprise, it was concluded that S1 would be the best solution for the case company. And the results verified the effectiveness of the framework. This paper develops a systematic and effective approach that decision-makers can use to conduct sustainable network design for Baijiu enterprises.",Network design towards sustainability of Chinese baijiu industry from a supply chain perspective, ,discrete dynamics in nature and society,85062400004,2018,,,,,,
"Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd. Today, organisations have focused on improving their supply chain performance to achieve sustainable profit and proceed in volatile markets. The nature of today’s volatile markets imposes parametric uncertainty to optimisation problems particularly in strategic decision making problems such as supply chain network design (SCND) problem. Two-stage stochastic programming (TSSP) and robust stochastic programming (RSP) approaches are widely used to deal with the uncertainty of optimisation problems. In this paper, the performance of these two approaches in a SCND problem is evaluated through conducting a case study in Iran and performing realisation process. The main objectives of this study are optimising three stage SCND problems under uncertainty and evaluating the performance of TSSP and RSP methods in optimising SCND problem under uncertainty. The results show that the RSP method leads to more robust solution than TSSP method. Also, the RSP method has more degree of flexibility to deal with the uncertainty according to DM preferences.",Evaluating the performance of robust and stochastic programming approaches in a supply chain network design problem under uncertainty,Robust stochastic programming *** RSP *** SCND *** Supply chain management *** Supply chain network design *** TSSP *** Two-stage stochastic programming *** Uncertainty,international journal of advanced operations management,85048378283,2018,,,,,,

Within business firms, executives and managers depend on demand and inventory data to make decisions for business operations. In this technological era, many firms are reliant on technological platforms to share mission critical information between their business units to prevent bullwhip effect due to information lag, and to improve coordination and collaboration among the units. Extant literature reveals that there is a strong research emphasis on information sharing practices between firms, and little on the information sharing practices within the firms for supply chain efficiencies. There is also limited research done to understand the impacts of information quality e.g. sharing mechanism, accuracy, timeliness and relevance have on the management of supply chains. Research often tend to focus on information sharing practices in modern businesses that utilises sophisticated IT systems for supply chain management, and neglects the business firms that operating in less developed environments.

"© 2017 Elsevier Ltd Sustainability of agro-food supply chains has recently become the subject of greater interest from consumers, firms, governmental organizations and academia as the environment continues to deteriorate. One of the most critical factors influencing the sustainability of an agro-food supply chain is its network design. A particularly challenging aspect in this context is the broad range of influencing indicators associated with the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) of sustainability that need to be considered. However, many of these indicators could not be fully integrated or measured by single-step optimization problems. This paper presents a critical literature review of operational research methods for the design of sustainable supply chains. A novel two-stage hybrid solution methodology is proposed. In the first stage, a partner selection is performed using a hybrid multi criteria decision making based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method and the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) aggregation method. The result obtained in the first stage is used in the second stage to develop a multi-objective mathematical model to optimize the design of the supply chain network. This approach allows the simultaneous consideration of all three dimensions of sustainability including carbon footprint, water footprint, number of jobs created and the total cost of the supply chain design. The proposed approach generates a Pareto frontier to aid users in making decisions. Numerical experiments are completed utilizing data from an agro-food company to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution methodology. The analyzes of the numerical results provide important organizational, practical and policy insights on (1) the impact of financial and environmental sustainability on supply chain network design (2) the tradeoff analysis between environmental emission, water footprint, societal implications and associated cost for making informed decision on supply chain investment.",Sustainable agro-food supply chain design using two-stage hybrid multi-objective decision-making approach,Agro-food supply chain design *** Analytical hierarchy process *** Decision-making *** Multi-objective optimization *** Sustainability,computers and operations research,85010999493,2018,,,,,,

"© 2017 Elsevier Ltd The rising concern about environmental impacts of fossil fuels has forced supply chains to focus more on environmentally sustainable energy sources. Solar is one of the most promising alternative sources of energy that is widely available and environment friendly. In this respect, this paper develops a two-phase approach based on data envelopment analysis and robust optimization models to design and plan a solar photovoltaic supply chain in an uncertain environment. Applying the data envelopment analysis model, the first phase identifies the most suitable candidate locations for solar plants according to a set of technical, geographical and social criteria. The selected locations are utilized later in the optimization model. This phase is capable of reducing the computational complexity of the optimization model by removing inappropriate sites. In the second phase, the robust optimization model determines both strategic and tactical decisions of photovoltaic supply chain, while ensuring that supply chain network is stable under almost all possible realizations of uncertain parameters. The performance of the proposed approach is examined by a real case study in Iran through which important managerial and practical insights are derived.",Robust design and optimization of solar photovoltaic supply chain in an uncertain environment,Data envelopment analysis *** Photovoltaic supply chain *** Robust optimization *** Solar energy *** Supply chain network design *** Uncertainty,energy,85031997990,2018,,,,,,
"© 2017 For decades agricultural development has been led by a modernisation paradigm based on specialisation, intensification and scale enlargement. This model of development model has been supported by means of price support policies and, often, strong central marketing agencies, which had a stabilising effect on prices and significantly reduced market risks for an array of commodities. The economic rationale of this model is based on the pursuit of economies of scale and highly efficient technical production. This model has led farmers to increasing their technical capacity and to neglect activities such as marketing, which was delegated to specialised marketing agencies. In this paper we argue that such specialisation has weakened the economic resilience of farms. Although a high level of specialisation allows farmers to be technically efficient, acquire highly specific production skills and apply the latest production techniques, it also leads specialised farms to be highly dependent on the commodity market(s) in which they operate, increasing their economic vulnerability. As markets have become deregulated, prices of both inputs and produce have become more volatile, often compromising the economic sustainability of these specialised farms. The weakened economic resilience of such farms has been aggravated by the gradual dismantling of producer price support causing an increase in price volatility, which has become a near-universal phenomenon for almost all agricultural produce. Highly specialised farming is now only viable where markets are stable and this requires the existence of effective market agencies and strong inter-branch organisations and/or the prevalence of contract farming. The increasing market orientation of the CAP, the fragmentation and weakening of marketing agencies and – last but not least– the growing societal demand for a more sustainable agriculture have led many farmers to rethink their farm development strategies. They are rediscovering farm diversification as one way of reducing market risks, as well improving the efficiency of the farm's organisation and resource use. Economies of scope emerge when a farmer can use the same input(s) to produce two or more products, and lower the cost of producing them separately. To achieve this end the inputs have to be complementary. By developing cost complementarities between different crops or livestock species, diversified farms can become more efficient than specialised farms. Another way that diversified farms can increase their economic sustainability is to partially produce for niche markets thereby generating a higher added value. A product mix of high quality products, possibly from the same production sector, but aimed at different, specific, market segments can further contribute to increasing the overall profitability of diversified farms. This paper summarises a series of case studies from EU member states and Israel which illustrate how farmers are experimenting with alternative pathways of development based on diversification. It is also shows the challenges they face. These include learning the skills for marketing high value-added farm products, establishing short food chains and the rebuilding supportive social and economic networks. The latter is particularly important when farms are too small to diversify effectively individually. Farms that participate in these economic networks are more able to internalise external economies generated within these networks and develop their knowledge of marketing and production through close cooperation with other farms. In some of the case studies the success of diversification clearly depended on the ability of farms to collaborate and share knowledge especially when new technical capacities for say, introducing crop diversification or intercropping, needed to be acquired. The knowledge involved in developing new crop rotation patterns, knowing about crop associations and combinations of crop and livestock activities was either developed ex novo or by rediscovering traditional knowledge. At the same time training in marketing food products is also a key to successfully shifting from being a specialised farm to a diversified one. Farmers need encouragement in order to work together and share their knowledge and experiences of diversification strategies. To this end policies that support collaborative networks are needed. Policies are also required to help establish and sustain collective marketing initiatives, especially short and direct supply chains. Finally, public support to assure against market risks is very helpful when farmers are entering into new markets. These policies are essential to support the existing processes of change that are occurring at grassroots level which are leading to a new model of farm modernisation. The specific contribution that this paper makes to the rural social science literature is to empirically highlight the limitations of theories about the benefits of economies of scale.",Specialisation and economies of scale or diversification and economies of scope?

"Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd. In this paper, designing of a supply chain regarding environmental consideration is addressed. For this purpose, a mixed integer linear programming model is proposed which integrates decisions about environmental investment and selection of active facilities in the network of the supply chain. In the proposed model, the emission of the environmental pollutants is considered through all stages of the supply chain for calculating the environmental effects of products according to the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. For each product, some limitations are considered that affect supply chain decisions. Such limitations may be imposed by environmental protection agencies or regional scheme. Also, due to uncertainty in some parameters of the proposed model, a robust optimisation approach is applied which makes the obtained solution robust and feasible with predetermined level of confidence against variability in uncertain parameters. The computational results illustrate the high performance of the proposed model.",Designing a green supply chain network using LCA method: A robust optimisation approach,Environmental investment *** green supply chain *** GSC *** LCA *** Life cycle assessment *** Robust optimisation,international journal of logistics systems and management,85054124966,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd A biocomposite production system (BPS) contains a wide range of elements that are vulnerable to internal as well as external factors that may stimulate a system to be disrupted. Hence, there is a need to manifest resiliency in order to withstand the inevitable change without affecting its robustness and stability. The three aspects of a resilient BPS are interconnectivity, adaptability and transformability. The interconnectivity concept deals with the reliability and effectiveness of the supply chain network and production systems’ resourcefulness. The adaptability aspect reinforces the agility and adjusting capacity of a system towards versatility and flexibility across the range of elements involved in the production system. Transformability deals with the capacity of a system to alter into a new system based on research, innovation and creativity. Therefore, the core aspects of resiliency in a BPS would result in increased stability and effectiveness. System dynamics models have been developed depicting the cause and effect of each of the three aspects. Finally, a model has been presented which could enable researchers and organizations to take guided decision towards a more robust and resilient BPS.",Imparting resiliency in biocomposite production systems: A system dynamics approach,Adaptability *** Biocomposite *** Interconnectivity *** Resiliency *** Sustainability,journal of cleaner production,85041471962,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 by the authors. Efficient and wise management of freshwater resources in South Africa has become critical because of the alarming freshwater scarceness. The situation requires a thorough examination of how water is utilized across various departments that use water. This paper reports on an examination of the water footprint and economic water productivities of the wheat-bread value chain. The assessment methodology of the Water Footprint Network was employed. The findings reveal that 954.07 m3 and 1026.07 m3 of water are utilized in the production of a ton of wheat flour in Bainsvlei and Clovelly in South Africa. The average water footprint for wheat bread was 954.53 m3 per ton in Bainsvlei and 1026.53 m3 per ton in Clovelly. More than 99% of the water is used in producing the grain at the farm level. The processing stage of the value chain uses less than 1% of the total water footprint. About 80% of all the water utilised along the wheat bread value chain is attributed to blue water. The findings revealed a significant shift from green water consumption to higher blue water use, and this is a major concern for water users and stakeholders along the wheat-bread value chain, given that blue water is becoming scarce in South Africa. The groundwater contributes about 34% and 42% of the average total water footprint of wheat at the farm level in Clovelly and Bainsvlei, respectively, suggesting the need to have an idea of the contribution of groundwater in water footprint evaluation and water management decision of farmers. This insight will aid in minimizing irrigation water use and pressure on groundwater resources. A total of ZAR 4.27 is obtained for every m3 of water utilized along the wheat-bread value chain. Water footprint assessment has moved away from sole indicator assessment, as a deeper awareness of and insight into the productive use of water at different stages has become vital for policy. To make a correct judgment and to assess the efficient and wise use of water, there is a need for catchment- or region-specific water footprint benchmarks, given that water footprint estimates and economic water productivities vary from one geographical area to another.",Water footprint accounting along the wheat-bread value chain: Implications for sustainable and productive water use benchmarks,Economic water productivities *** Groundwater *** South Africa *** Value addition *** Water footprint accounting *** Wheat-bread,water (switzerland),85052703469,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers Strategy focused supply chains, in general follow an evolutionary sequence as observed from literature. This evolutionary sequence extends from lean to green and to sustainable supply chains; as well as from agile to leagile and to resilient supply chains. In this research, the sequence of evolution of resilient and sustainable supply chains has been investigated with respect to the positioning of partition line in supply networks. Partition line, which is a point of separation of strategic objectives, can be sensibly positioned in a supply network to fetch the benefits of sustainability and resilience together. Aligning the objectives of sustainability and resilience in a supply network is explained through multiple case analyses of manufacturing networks. Case analysis, as elaborated in this research could help managers in matching and scrutinizing their supply networks by finding analogy of the pertinent case from the explicated model cases. Positioning the partition line in a supply network and assigning strategic objectives on either sides of it open insights into a new category of both sustainability and resilience oriented networks, which is the concept of discussion in the paper.","On sustainability, resilience, and the sustainable–resilient supply networks",Partition line *** Resilience *** Supply networks *** Sustainability,sustainable production and consumption,85047414582,2018,1,1,1,,,
"© 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. The waste in the perishable goods supply-chain has prompted many global organizations (e.g.; FAO and WHO), to develop the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) protocol that ensures a high degree of food quality, minimizing the losses in all the stages of the farm-to-fork chain. It has been proven that good warehouse management practices improve the average life of perishable goods. The advances in wireless sensors network (WSN) technology offers the possibility of a “smart” storage organization. In this paper, a low cost reprogrammable WSN-based architecture for functional warehouse management is proposed. The management is based on the continuous monitoring of environmental parameters (i.e.; temperature, light exposure and relative humidity), and on their combination to extract a spatial real-time prediction of the product shelf life. For each product, the quality decay is computed by using a 1st order kinetic Arrhenius model to the whole storage site area. It strives to identify, in a way compatible with the other products’ shelf lives, the position within the warehouse that maximizes the food expiration date. The shelf life computing and the “first-expired first-out” logistic problem are entrusted to a Raspberry Pi-based central unit, which manages a set of automated pallet transporters for the displacement of products, according to the computed shelf lives. The management unit supports several commercial light/temperature/humidity sensor solutions, implementing ZigBee, Bluetooth and HTTP-request interfaces. A proof of concept of the presented pro-active WSN-based architecture is also shown. Comparing the proposed monitoring system for the storage of e.g.; agricultural products, with a typical one, the experimental results show an improvement of the expected expiration date of about 1.2 ± 0.5 days, for each pallet, when placed in a non-refrigerated environment. In order to stress the versatility of the WSN solution, a section is dedicated to the implemented system user interfaces that highlight detecting critical situations and allow timely automatic or human interventions, minimizing the latter.",Spatio-temporal optimization of perishable goods’ shelf life by a pro-active WSN-based architecture,Automated platform *** Bluetooth *** Shelf life *** WSN *** ZigBee,sensors (switzerland),85049435747,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd Green purchasing is a critical factor in sustainable enterprise development, and it often affects a company's business performance and environmental protection practices. An enterprise must have an appropriate assessment model to address the complexities of green purchasing. Most green purchasing studies have focused on the use of green criteria in the selection of suppliers to develop sustainable operations. By contrast, there have been few articles on green supply chain management discussing both green supplier evaluation and order allocation. This study proposes a novel model that integrates the best–worst method (BWM), modified fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), and fuzzy multi-objective linear programming (FMOLP) to solve problems in green supplier selection and order allocation. We demonstrated the proposed method using actual data provided by an electronics company.

"© 2018, Taiwan Fuzzy Systems Association and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. The complex relationships between firms in today’s competitive business world affect supply chain (SC) structures so that managers have to consider SC versus SC relations instead of firm versus firm ones. In the corporate or multi-business companies, it is possible to share a number of resources between different SCs to achieve synergy and reduce costs. This paper addresses the strategic–tactical SC planning decisions (i.e., SC network design and master planning) in an uncertain environment for allied SCs belong to a single corporate. First, a fuzzy mixed-integer mathematical programming model that considers the imprecise nature of critical parameters such as cost coefficients, capacity levels, market demands is developed for integrated design of two SCs. Then, a robust possibilistic programming model is proposed to cope with the inherent uncertainty in the model parameters. The proposed model is able to achieve significant cost synergies via integrating the design of corporate SCs. Using hypothetical data inspired by an industrial case, the performance and applicability of the proposed models are investigated via experimental evaluations. Computational results indicate that our proposed model and solution approach can effectively be used to solve the allied SCs under uncertain condition.",Network Design for Allied Supply Chains under Uncertain Conditions: A Possibilistic Programming Approach,Allied supply chains *** Cooperation *** Corporate supply chain *** Integrated supply chain network design *** Robust possibilistic programming,international journal of fuzzy systems,85050770098,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd The aim of this research is to consider the issue of sustainability in designing a blood supply chain network by presenting a multi objective mixed integer mathematical programming model that aims to simultaneously minimize the total cost of the supply chain network and the total environmental impacts of the activities of the supply chain network. As the nature of supplying the blood by the donors and also demand for the blood product are uncertain, a robust optimization approach is applied in the model to deal with this type of uncertainty. To convert the proposed multi objective model into a single objective one, the bounded objective function method is used. Then, as the presented mathematical model is a complicated mixed integer linear programming model, an algorithm based on the Lagrangian relaxation approach is proposed to solve the model. At the end, a computational study is done to present the competency of the proposed Lagrangian relaxation algorithm.","Green-blood supply chain network design: Robust optimization, bounded objective function &amp; Lagrangian relaxation",Blood supply chain *** Bounded objective function *** Green supply chain *** Lagrangian relaxation *** Multi-objective optimization *** Robust optimization,computers and industrial engineering,85047799347,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 Elsevier B.V. This study combined the input-output clustering analysis and structural path betweenness analysis, and identified critical sectors belonging to important emission clusters in the global supply chain networks associated with final demand of transport equipment in five countries (United States, China, Germany, Japan, and France). Clustering analysis can divide the groups constructing the strong connecting supply chain with large emissions from the global supply chain network, and structural path betweenness represents how much CO2 emissions from the supply chain paths a sector has in global supply chain network. I applied the combined method to the EORA database which covers 189 countries and focused on the whole global supply chain networks in detail. The results demonstrate that the global supply chain networks of transport equipment were well separated into emission clusters with higher emissions that consist of sectors with higher structural path betweenness. Chinese emission clusters were identified from the global supply chain networks for the five countries in question and the betweenness of Chinese sectors tend to be higher values in the supply chain networks. In this study, I suggested supply chain management of high priority sectors for a reduction in CO2 emissions of transport equipment in the producing countries.",Environmentally-Targeted Sectors and Linkages in the Global Supply-Chain Complexity of Transport Equipment,Climate mitigation policy *** CO  emissions 2 *** Global supply chain complexity *** Input-output clustering analysis *** International trade *** Structural path betweenness analysis,ecological economics,85046090534,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 ICIC International. In the supply chain realm, Reverse Logistics (RL) is a feasible strategy to comply with environmental regulations because it can contribute to increasing resource-efficiency by recollecting and refurbishing leftover wastes. However, RL unavoidably causes environmental burdens due to the uses of transportation vehicles. Thus, it is critical to develop an environmentally-conscious transportation model that can improve resource-efficiency through reducing subsidiary materials under given circumstance. Additionally, such the model’s environmental performance should be quantitatively analyzed through a common methodology, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). However, the dynamic, various and complex characteristics in RL are major obstacles of the application of LCA, which is mainly targeted at static product systems. This paper presents: the proposition of an environmentally-conscious transportation model, the design of an integration method of LCA with RL, and the application of LCA to a case of home appliances in an RL network.",Integration of environmentally-conscious transportation model with life cycle assessment in reverse logistics,Environmental consciousness *** Green supply chain management *** Life cycle assessment *** Reverse logistics,"icic express letters, part b: applications",85050616361,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 by the authors. This research offers the first use of graph theory mathematics in social network analysis to explore relationships built through an alternative food network. The local food system is visualized using geo-social data from 110 farms and 224 markets around Baltimore County, Maryland, with 699 connections between them. Network behavior is explored through policy document review and interviews. The findings revealed a small-world architecture, with system resiliency built-in by diversified marketing practices at central nodes. This robust network design helps to explain the long-term survival of local food systems despite the meteoric rise of global industrial food supply chains. Modern alternative food networks are an example of a movement that seeks to reorient economic power structures in response to a variety of food system-related issues not limited to consumer health but including environmental impacts. Uncovering the underlying network architecture of this sustainability-oriented social movement helps reveal how it weaves systemic change more broadly. The methods used in this study demonstrate how social values, social networks, markets, and governance systems embed to transform both physical landscapes and human bodies. Network actors crafted informal policy reports, which were directly incorporated in state and local official land-use and economic planning documents.

"© 2018 Cisa Publisher. Since biomass and bio-waste to energy systems condense activities that have important socio-economic and environmental sustainability effects, it is important that viability and impact studies have a socio-economic dimension, beyond the techno-economic and institutional aspects. This is necessitated in particular, by the limited and scattered availability of biomass or its residues, links to agricultural and forestry activities and associated socio-economic sustainability issues like land use, harvesting, transporting and economic conversion plant supplies. Such socio-economic studies, done prior to the project, can reflect a lot on the feasibility of projects, likely impacts and even help to optimize facility locations, network configurations or fleet management at various points or on the whole the supply chain. When the studies are done in retrospect of the project, as impact studies, they show how bioenergy projects can transform societies. The impact studies can then be useful precursors to similar projects within the same country/region or other similar regions. This review classifies socio-economic study literature into ‘viability’ studies-done prior to the project; and ‘impact’ studies-usually done after the project, except for ‘projected impact studies’. The studies are also classified as ‘quantitative and systematic’ or ‘qualitative’. Nonetheless, there are occasional overlaps between these study class-es. Intentionally designed integrated approaches could actually give more comprehensive results, although in most cases, they result in complex models. This classification can guide researchers to make the right choice of the socio-economic study to carry out based on their objectives.",A critical taxonomy of socio-economic studies around biomass and bio-waste to energy projects, ,detritus,85085487629,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd This paper presents a fuzzy bi-objective bi-level model with a price-dependent demand for the network design of a closed-loop supply chain in the presences of random disruptions at suppliers. The environmental issues resulted in considering two strategies, namely: adding a reverse flow to the supply chain and controlling the amount of CO2 emissions. In this model, the uncertain demand is assumed as a function of price offered to the customers by the supply chain and its rival. The proposed model determines outsourcing strategies, pricing decisions that maximize the total profit in such a competitive situation and minimizes the amount of CO2 emissions by production processes. A hybrid approach combining Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (K-K-T) conditions and possibilistic method was developed to solve the fuzzy bi-level model. Then the ε-constraint method is used to convert the integrated bi-objective model to a single-objective one. Finally, important managerial insights are obtained from an empirical case study of a filter industry.",A fuzzy pricing model for a green competitive closed-loop supply chain network design in the presence of disruptions,Competition *** Disruption *** Fuzzy theory *** green closed-loop supply chain *** Karush-Kuhn-tucker condition *** Pricing,journal of cleaner production,85056233518,2018,,,,,,

This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License. Background: Drug counterfeiting is a global problem with significant risks to consumers and the general public. In the Philippines, 30% of inspected drug stores in 2003 were found with substandard/spurious/falsely-labeled/falsified/counterfeit drugs. The economic burden on the population drug expenditures and on governments is high. The Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) encourages the public to check the certificates of product registration and report any instances of counterfeiting. The National Police of Philippines responds to such reports through a special task force. However, no literature on its impact on the distribution of such drugs were found. Blockchain technology is a cryptographic ledger that is allegedly immutable through repeated sequential hashing and fault-tolerant through a consensus algorithm. This project will develop and test a pharmacosurveillance blockchain system that will support information sharing along the official drug distribution network. Objective: This study aims to develop a pharmacosurveillance blockchain system and test its functions in a simulated network. Methods: We are developing a Distributed Application (DApp) that will run on smart contracts, employing Swarm as the Distributed File System (DFS). Two instances will be developed: one for Ethereum and another for Hyperledger Fabric. The proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm of Ethereum will be modified into a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) or practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm as it is scalable and fits the drug supply chain environment. The system will adopt the GS1 pedigree standard and will satisfy the data points in the data standardization guidelines from the US FDA. Simulations will use the following 5 nodes: for FDA, manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, and the consumer portal. Results: Development is underway. The design of the system will place FDA in a supervisory data verification role, with each pedigree type-specific data source serving a primary data verification role. The supply chain process will be initiated by the manufacturer, with recursive verification for every transaction. It will allow consumers to scan a code printed on the receipt of their purchases to review the drug distribution history. Conclusions: Development and testing will be conducted in a simulated network, and thus, results may differ from actual practice. The project being proposed is disruptive; once tested, the team intends to engage the Philippine FDA to discuss implementation plans and formulate policies to facilitate adoption and sustainability.",Blockchain technology for detecting falsified and substandard drugs in distribution: Pharmaceutical supply chain intervention,Blockchain *** Counterfeit drugs *** Distribution *** Information systems *** Supply,journal of medical internet research,85096028707,2018,,,,,,

"© 2018 Elsevier B.V. The traditional supply chains faces several challenges such as uncertainty, cost, complexity and vulnerable problems. To overcome these problems the supply chains must be more smarter. For establishing a large-scale of smart infrastructure to merge data, information, products, physical objects and all processes of supply chain, we applies the internet of things (IOT) in supply chain management (SCM) through building a smart and secure system of SCM. We have prepared a website for suppliers and managers. We tracked the flow of products at each stage in supply chain management through the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. Each product attached with RFID tag and scanned through RFID reader and ESP8266 at each phase of supply chain management. After scanning the tag we stores tag id in the database. All information about products will be entered by suppliers and then uploaded to managers. In our system the supplier and manager gets perfect information of the entire life cycle of goods, and this will achieve transparency of supply chain management. For assessing security criteria of proposed system of supply chain management, we also proposed a framework which integrates neutrosophic Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (N-DEMATEL) technique with analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The neutrosophic Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (N-DEMATEL) technique is utilized to infer cause and effect interrelationships among criteria of smart supply chain security requirements. Depending on obtained information from (N-DEMATEL) the neutrosophic AHP is utilized to calculate weight of criteria and sub-criteria. Then the integrated framework will help researchers and practitioners to design secure system of supply chains. We presented DEMATEL and AHP in neutrosophic environment to deal effectively with vague, uncertain and incomplete information. So the proposed system of supply chain management will be able to overcome all challenges of traditional SCM and provide secure environment of SCM processes.","Internet of Things (IoT) and its impact on supply chain: A framework for building smart, secure and efficient systems",Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) *** DEMATEL technique *** Internet of Things (IOT) *** Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) *** Neutrosophic set *** Radio frequency identification (RFID) *** Supply chain management (SCM),future generation computer systems,85046668669,2018,,,,,,

"© 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a conceptual and historical overview of the evolution of outsourcing. The authors then focus and prognosticate on the future of outsourcing and develop several compelling ideas based on extant insights and the rule of three axioms. Design/methodology/approach: The insights are developed based on a review of the extant literature and evolution of trends. Findings: The paper generates several insights. First, there is a need to carefully differentiate between core and non-core functions when deciding on whether/what to outsource. Some outsourcing options may boost financial performance in the short run but undermine the long-term viability of the firm. Public firms outsource more than private firms after controlling for size. In many cases, the optimal number of primary suppliers for a critical function/process/stock keeping unit (SKU) is three (while also allowing for a number of secondary suppliers). The optimal share distribution between the suppliers for the same SKU is rank ordinal (i.e. not equal). The complexity and the maturity of the supply chain as well as industry life cycle, regulation and technology influence the optimal number of primary suppliers. Research limitations/implications: The insights have significant implications for outsourcing decisions and for improving their impact on firm performance. The emergence of the shared economy, subscription-based business models and crowdsourcing will lead to consumers, business and society that increasingly borrows rather than one that makes or buys. Originality/value: The paper represents the first attempt to integrate the axioms of the rule of three with the outsourcing literature and the theory of the firm. It emphasizes the need to align (long-term) performance objectives with managerial incentives as businesses manage their outsourcing efforts.","Make, buy, borrow or crowdsource?

"© 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature. It is estimated that recycling can avert approximately 50% annual landfill cost, while simultaneously recovering lost materials valued at 4 to 9.5% of the total logistics network cost. This study proposes a robust integrated reverse logistics supply chain planning model with a modular product design at different quality levels. A mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is formulated to maximise the profit by considering the collection of returned products, the recovery of modules and the proportion of the product mix at different quality levels. This paper proposes the collection of returnable items (end-of-life, defective and under-warranty products) through retail outlets and the appropriate recovery of modules to manage these using a network of recovery service providers. The modular product design approach is adopted to create design criteria that provide an improved recovery process at a lower cost. This robust model seeks solutions close to the mathematically optimal solutions for a set of alternative scenarios identified by a decision-maker. The efficacy of the proposed model is evaluated by a given set of variously sized numerical expressions and sensitivity analyses. A robust solution is found that appraises the impact of two major sources of uncertainty, demand rate and the volume of returned products of a key recycled material.",Modular recycling supply chain under uncertainty: a robust optimisation approach,Closed-loop supply chain network *** MIP model *** Reverse logistics (RL) *** Robust optimisation *** Uncertainty environment,international journal of advanced manufacturing technology,85044747455,2018,,,,,,

Firstly, ontology model is employed to represent domain and response knowledge including disaster scenario features, UWSN risks and response strategies. Secondly, a two-step case retrieval method is used to match disaster scenarios in order to generate available case set and then obtain similar case set by risk matching. Thirdly, based on the differences between scenarios, inappropriate risk response strategies in the similar case set are adjusted in order to generate practical response strategy plan.

"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd This paper makes an in-depth analysis on demand-driven natural resource requirements in China via the methods of thermodynamic input-output analysis and structural path analysis, in order to reveal the connections between the country's rapid economic development and its intensive use of natural resources. The main natural resources investigated include crops, forestry, rangeland, aquatic products, coal, crude oil & natural gas, ferrous metal ores, nonferrous metal ores, nonmetallic minerals and other primary energy, and exergy is adopted as a common metric for the resource accounting. In 2012, the total domestic resource exergy input into Chinese economic system amounted to 130.1 EJ, of which 44.6% was induced by investment demands. The embodied resource use (ERU) in China's exports was equivalent to over one fifth of its domestic resource supply. The two integrative sectors of Manufacturing and Construction accounted for 44.1% and 28.7% of the national total ERU, respectively. We identified critical supply chain paths starting from resource extraction to final demand, as well as key industrial sectors in driving the extraction, transmission and final use of embodied resources.

"© 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Purpose: The environmental life cycle management (LCM) literature proposes many factors considered critical in order to successfully conduct LCM. This study contrasts these vague and general factors proposed as critical to LCM in existing literature, with detailed accounts of LCM in practice. Methods: A literature review of three related research fields, i.e., LCM, life cycle thinking, and sustainable supply chain management, is contrasted with a study of how LCM is enacted in practice in a large multinational manufacturing company recognized for its LCM work. A qualitative study, with mainly a managerial focus, is conducted based on interviews, workshops, part-time observations, and document studies. Results and discussion: The literature review demonstrates that the three related research fields provide different accounts of LCM: all apply a holistic environmental perspective, but with different emphases and using largely different research methods. The empirical study shows that integration was a common topic at the studied company and that solutions were often sought in tools and processes. Middle management support proved important, and challenging, in these integration efforts. Challenges identified also included further integrating LCM into departments such as purchasing and sales. Conclusions: The constant focus on integration at the studied company implies that LCM work is an ongoing effort. Several integration paths are identified: (1) inclusion of sustainability aspects in tools and processes, (2) finding ways to work around certain organizational levels, and (3) using networks and social interaction to create commitment and integration. Although the concept of LCM implies a holistic approach, LCM in practice reveals a lack of a comprehensive overview of LCM-related initiatives and of involved sustainability practitioners within the studied organization.",Organizing life cycle management in practice: challenges of a multinational manufacturing corporation,Environmental life cycle management (LCM) *** Integration *** Networks *** Organization *** Practice-oriented *** Product chains *** Sustainability,international journal of life cycle assessment,85098041366,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd The water-energy-food-climate nexus has risen rapidly in global water governance over the past decade. This article examines the role of global financial networks in articulating the nexus and in connecting it to sustainability programs. It provides new insights into critical engagements with the nexus that, to date, have focused predominantly on water security and governance. The article examines how global financial networks conceptualized and concretized the nexus towards two ends: First, the nexus was used to effect the transition from state-oriented development models to financialized approaches of water development and sustainability. Here, the nexus was formulated in critique of, and as a solution to, the previously dominant approach to water development: integrated water resources management (IWRM). Second, the nexus was deployed to connect water, energy, food, and climate to the global economy in terms of complex systems. The identification of risks to the resilience of environmental and economic systems provided a new form of integration across the supply chains affected by the governance and security of water, energy, food, and climate. In both cases, the nexus mobilizes technologies of global finance, such as credit-risk ratings, to construct and defend new strategies for governing water security and to enable sub-sovereign actors, such as municipalities, to be incorporated into the global economy. The paper concludes that alignments of the nexus with sustainability programs, and the Sustainable Development Goals, must be reconsidered in view of the constraints posed by financial orientations towards the risks and resilience of economic and environmental systems.",From state to system: Financialization and the water-energy-food-climate nexus,Finance *** Nexus *** Resilience *** Risk *** Sustainability *** Systems,geoforum,85043231220,2018,,,,,,
"© 2017 Elsevier B.V. In today's business environments, the high importance of economic benefits and environmental impacts of using scrapped products has caused most companies to move to designing the closed loop supply chain network. This paper considers the closed loop supply chain network design problem under hybrid uncertainty, while there are two sources of uncertainty for most parameters, thus require fortifying of the robustness of the decision. The first source is that some uncertain parameters may be based on the future scenarios which are considered according to the probability of their occurrence. The second source is that the values of these parameters in each scenario are usually imprecise and can be specified by possibilistic distributions. In this case, the best robust decision has some additional properties in terms of mean value and variability of the objective function. We introduced two types of the variability named scenario variability and possibilistic variability. Possibility theory is used to choose a solution in such a problem and a novel robust fuzzy stochastic programming approach is proposed that has significant advantages. The performance of the proposed model is also compared with that of other models in term of the mean cost and variability by simulation.",A novel robust fuzzy stochastic programming for closed loop supply chain network design under hybrid uncertainty,"Closed-loop supply chain network design, hybrid uncertainty *** Credibility measure *** Possibilistic mean absolute deviation *** Robust fuzzy stochastic programming",fuzzy sets and systems,85017475960,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd The automotive manufacturing industry is under financial pressure due to massive cost structure, relatively small scale operation and strong global competition. In order to improve their operational cost efficiency, companies have adopt lean principles in all their manufacturing activities, in particular, just-in-time supply chain. However, a consequence of this policy makes the transportation network from the local supply chain time critical. This paper uses an enterprise system model integrated with a quantitative method to study a manufacturing company's logistics system re-development project. The quantitative risk analysis examines the project's systems engineering management plan to see if it is sufficiently to mitigate risks in design, monitoring and validation of the project's lifecycle processes. The computed risk profile shows a trend of decreasing risk and suggests areas of improvement in the systems engineering plan to ensure greater probability of success. The research assumes a single risk profile for the supply chain. Research is continuing in expanding to more accurate risk profile of the project when partners of the supply chain have individual profiles.",Quantitative lifecycle risk analysis of the development of a just-in-time transportation network system,Enterprise model *** Lifecycle risk assessment *** Time critical manufacturing *** Transportation network,advanced engineering informatics,85043757047,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 Materials and Energy Research Center. All Rights Reserved. Nowadays, the design of a strategic supply chain network under disruption is one of the most important priorities of the governments. One of the strategic purposes of managers is to supply the sustainable agricultural products and food in stable conditions which require the production of soil nutrients. In this regard, some disruptions such as sanctions and natural disasters have a destructive effect on the supply of raw materials and the uncertainty of input parameters plays an undesirable impact on the decision-making levels including strategic, tactical, and operational levels. The present study introduced a new model of resilient supply chain network which was compatible with the realities of the structure of the supply chain for fertilizer in Iran. Notably, the effectiveness of the designed system was promoted by the dominant strategies of reliability. Further, a new robust possibilistic approach was proposed which guaranteed the optimality and feasibility robustness through the efficient solution to deal with the parametric uncertainty. Finally, the results showed that the proposed new robust possibilistic combination promoted the optimality robustness and its effectiveness using an optimal average cost and minimum standard deviation.",A new combination of robust-possibilistic mathematical programming for resilient supply Chain network under disruptions and uncertainty: A real supply Chain,Disruption *** Possibilistic Programming *** Robustness *** Supply Chain *** Uncertainty,"international journal of engineering, transactions a: basics",85047537773,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd This paper proposes a multi-objective robust possibilistic programming model for the design of a sustainable switchgrass-based bioethanol supply chain network under the epistemic uncertainty of input data considering conflicting economic, environmental and social objectives. The newest and most effective environmental and social life cycle assessment-based methods are applied to the proposed model to measure the relevant environmental and social impacts. To deal with uncertain parameters effectively, a novel multi-objective robust possibilistic programming approach is developed which is able to maximize the mean value of supply chain performance and control the optimality as well as feasibility robustness. Computational analysis is also provided by using a real case study in Iran to show the performance and validity of the proposed model. The results show that with an increase of 2.43% in the economic objective function, a desirable level of environmental and social protection is achieved. Additionally, the mean value of supply chain performance will enjoy more desirable values if the influence of optimality robustness and feasibility robustness decreases. The results also demonstrate that the proposed robust model outperforms the deterministic model in terms of the average and standard deviation measures.",A multi-objective robust possibilistic programming approach to sustainable switchgrass-based bioethanol supply chain network design,Bioethanol supply chain *** Life cycle assessment *** Multi-objective optimization *** Robust possibilistic programming *** Sustainable development *** Switchgrass,journal of cleaner production,85041464582,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Governments and global corporations increasingly both confront and rely on international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) to identify, design, and deliver interventions that prompt transformational change in societies, industries, and supply chains. For INGOs, transformational change is defined as a fundamental, long-lasting reframing of a social or industrial system through synergistically altering the knowledge, practices, and relationships of multiple stakeholder groups. With each intervention, the focal INGO assembles its own complex supply chain of nonprofit organizations and for-profit firms to provide the necessary resources and skills. While prior supply chain management literature provides a good starting point, with some generalizability to the nonprofit sector, this study begins with several key differences to explore how interventions are delivered, and then, how INGOs’ supply chains must be aligned. In doing so, at least three critical factors must be taken into account to improve alignment: stakeholder-induced uncertainty; supply chain configuration; and supply chain dynamism. By synthesizing these factors with prior literature and emerging anecdotal evidence, tentative frameworks and research questions emerge about how INGOs can better leverage their supply chains, thereby offering a basis for scholars in supply chain management to build a much richer and more nuanced research understanding of INGOs.",EMERGING DISCOURSE INCUBATOR: Delivering Transformational Change: Aligning Supply Chains and Stakeholders in Non-Governmental Organizations,nonprofit organizations *** rigid resources *** services *** supply networks *** sustainability,journal of supply chain management,85045141474,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd The shortage of natural resources, the need to take into account societal considerations, the emergence of new government regulations and the necessity to maintain and/or improve the economic benefit of the supply chain, have created a growing awareness on academia as well as industries towards the development of closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs), where explicitly products’ life-cycles are accounted for. Concentrating on the problems of the product and network design for a multi-product, multi-echelon and multi-period CLSC, in this work a two-stage stochastic mixed integer linear model incorporating uncertainty on the quality and quantity of the return flows is proposed. In addition, risk management related to critical uncertain parameters is performed, where a conditional value at risk (CVaR) concept is applied to supply chain profits. The formulation considers decisions associated with the network design and, simultaneously, with the products to manufacture (new and remanufactured) and their associated raw materials (new and recovered). A network superstructure is considered accounting for two types of customers (first and second markets), raw material suppliers, factories, distribution centers, customer demands, recovery centers, recycle centers, final disposal locations and re-distribution centers. Optimal solutions with high economic and environmental benefits are obtained where the advantages of using the proposed approach are shown.

"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd Food deterioration is becoming a crucial problem for most countries in the world, which may cause both economical losses and environmental damages. In this paper, a Stackelberg gaming model for a three-level food supply chain (consists of one retailer, one vendor and one supplier) with production disruption is established, which aims to study the optimal pricing, inventory and preservation decisions that maximize the individual profit. In the decentralized supply chain, upstream firms act as leaders and downstream firms as followers. Due to the mathematical complexity, an illustrative algorithm is developed to solve the problem. Numerical tests show that retailer's preservation investment not only benefits itself, but also benefits the vendor and the supplier. Comparing the optimal decisions to that in the ‘forward integration’ and ‘backward integration’ model, supply chain members’ vertical cooperation helps to enhance the total profit. Meanwhile, the carbon footprint of the food supply chain is also studied. It is found that, vertical cooperation contributes to the reduction of carbon emission. In most situations, ‘forward integration’ outperforms ‘backward integration’ strategy because it incents the retailer to invest more in preservation and reduce food deterioration. Other managerial implications are also shown in the paper.",Pricing and inventory decisions in the food supply chain with production disruption and controllable deterioration,Carbon emission *** Cooperative strategies *** Deteriorating items *** Game theory *** Preservation investment,journal of cleaner production,85042118892,2018,,,,,,

Considerations of mineral resource availability and depletion form part of a diverse array of sustainable development-oriented studies, across domains such as resource criticality, life cycle assessment and material flow analysis. Given the multidisciplinary nature of these studies, it is important that a common understanding of the complexity and nuances of mineral supply chains be developed. In this paper, we provide a brief overview of these assessment approaches and expand on several areas that are conceptually difficult to account for in these studies. These include the dynamic nature of relationships between reserves, resources, cut-off grades and ore grades; the ability to account for local economic, social and environmental factors when performing global assessments; and the role that technology improvements play in increasing the availability of economically extractable mineral resources.

The ability or inability to develop an effective, reliable supplier network can often play a major role in determining an organization's competitive position. Especially in today's era of a complex global economy, disruptions to an organization's supply chain can drastically undermine its ability to compete. We analyze the interaction between density risk, or risk related to the proximal relationships between suppliers, and environmental risk, or risk arising from conditions affecting a supplier's local business environment. We provide a powerful supply base risk mitigation strategy incorporating spatial analytics to enhance our analyses. We develop a multi-objective program to manage these factors and recommend minimal risk supply bases. We detail the interaction between objectives in an example and discuss the ramifications for managers.

"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd Bio-fuel is one of the most important alternatives to fossil fuels due to energy shortages. The bio-fuel is derived from biomass that is obtained from agricultural products such as plant debris. In addition, the supply chain is affected by risks which are due to several reasons such as economic, natural phenomena, political and etc. The occurrence of such events can cause disruption in supply chain which can significantly increase the total supply chain costs and also prevent serve to customers. Reliability is involved the capability of a network to achieve an anticipated process such as ``communication”. Analysis of network reliability has acknowledged significant consideration and is consequently broadly studied to forecast and avoid any network failure. In order to distribute bio-fuel to the customers, designing a reliable and sustainable bio-fuel supply chain is very importance. Thus a growth in bio-fuel production demonstrates the requirement for establishing an effective and reliable network of chain that not only accomplishes sound under regular circumstances nevertheless restricted risk under various unanticipated disruption situations. This paper presents mathematical model to design an efficient bio-fuel supply chain network at pre-disaster stage that considering failure in the connecting links between the facilities. In which the probability of failure of the links is forecasted by a spatial statistic approach and also due to the fact that disasters can cause disruptions in bio-refineries, leads to use the risk-pooling effect in order to reduce total costs. In order to solve the proposed mathematical model, two meta-heuristic algorithms containing genetic algorithm (GA) and bat algorithm (BA) are utilized. The results show that by increasing the reliability and improvement of connecting links between facilities and considering the risk-pooling effect on disrupted bio-refineries, the total costs of supply chain can be considerably reduced.",Designing a bio-fuel network considering links reliability and risk-pooling effect in bio-refineries,Bio-fuel supply chain network design *** Bio-refinery disruption *** Link failure probabilities *** Reliability *** Risk-pooling,reliability engineering and system safety,85042361738,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd Biomass has the potential to create sustainable energy systems, which is critical for societal welfare. A major issue regarding biomass resources is crop residues or leftover biomass that is burnt by farmers after harvesting; this happens due to high transportation costs which make burning the cheapest way to remove the residue. We develop a decision support system using a large-scale linear program with the goal of maximizing profit with and without the emission cost. This system helps identify farms that would benefit society were they to be incentivized under a biomass crop assistance program (BCAP). A case study of leftover corn stover in the state of North Dakota is analyzed to validate the model. Our results reveal that an incentive of $7.20 per ton of corn stover converted to ethanol when 20% of rail capacity is allocated is ideal, as it produces the lowest emissions of 16,784,953 metric tons with a $73,462,599 profit. Furthermore, penalizing emissions resulting from the transportation of corn stover also helps reduce emissions; a suitable value for the penalty could be $71.7 per metric ton of CO2 emitted. Such a policy would result in reducing dependency on petroleum, thus promoting a sustainable biomass supply chain.",Biomass feedstock supply chain network design with biomass conversion incentives,Biomass *** Greenhouse gas emissions *** Incentives *** Optimization *** Supply chain management,energy policy,85044636811,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: The implementation of sustainable supply chain management (SCM) calls for an acknowledgement of uncertainty inherent in complex environment. Confucianist society forms social networks in Confucianist society, called guanxi networks, influence economic behaviours and business practices in the workplace. The purpose of this study is to explore how these social networks influence the implementation of sustainable SCM. In doing so, this study aims to critically investigate the constructs of guanxi networks, their impact on flow of supply chain capital and how this leverages the implementation of sustainable SCM. Design/methodology/approach: Two systematic literature reviews are conducted to understand the constructs of social networks in Confucianist culture and their impacts on the flow of supply chain capitals. The reviews also analyse evidence related to the economic, social and environmental practices to reveal the current state of the literature and research gaps. Propositions and a framework are developed to support future research in this area. Findings: The constructs of ganqing, renqing, xinren and mianzi in guanxi networks have expanded the contexts of social networks in Western literature. Guanxi networks increase the flow of supply chain capital and generate trust between players, thus enhancing capabilities to implement sustainable SCM. Guanxi networks also create the mechanism of network governance with which to increase sustainable SCM implementation under the institutional logics of sustainability. Research limitations/implications: The conceptual framework and justification are based on the reviews of current studies in the field. Future empirical study is encouraged to test the propositions, both in Confucianist culture and other countries with culture of social networks. Originality/value: Social networks are socially constructed concepts. The constructs of guanxi networks revealed in this study have developed the knowledge of Western-based social network theory. Besides, arguments from a social network perspective provide an alternative answer to explain increased behavioural commitment and companies’ investment in sustainable SCM. This study helps practitioners understand the logic of this social norm and to use it to maximise their operation outputs, including sustainable SCM implementation.",Exploring sustainable supply chain management: a social network perspective,Guanxi *** Social capital *** Supply-chain management *** Sustainability *** Trust,supply chain management,85048125190,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018 Elsevier B.V. Investments in a supply chain (in distribution centers, stores, and with suppliers) face risk when buyer-supplier contracts do not adequately address the elements responsible for a sustainable exchange relationship. Supply chains become vulnerable due to natural and man-made catastrophes and due to ineffectiveness in operations. Contracts form the basis for communication and relationship management between a buyer and a supplier. We provide an analytical framework that addresses supply chain effectiveness (costs, risks, transaction costs, stakeholder issues) and would help inform managers who grapple with such concerns. We propose three factors (costs, benefits, and risks) that capture the objective nature and one parameter that deals with the subjective nature of sustainable contracts. To illustrate the framework we collect representative cost (objective) data from suppliers, integrate behavioral (subjective) elements, and employ constrained optimization techniques to compare five supplier-engagement contract policies. We then refine this cost-based solution, for a given contract policy, to develop three cost-benefit-risk trade-off formulations and illustrate them using simulated data. The framework addresses supplier and network-based externalities, supplier and network level effectiveness, and transaction costs, and thus provides a mechanism to enable a coordinator-driven sustainable supply network. The analysis informs contract development and evaluation process and helps align buyer-supplier interest in the long-run. We believe the analysis will help build sustainable buyer-supplier relations. Network coordinators who would benefit from our framework include original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), suppliers (say tier-1 suppliers in automotive industry), retailers (especially as retailers pursue private labels and become more involved in manufacturing and branding), etc.",Analytical framework for sustainable supply-chain contract management, ,international journal of production economics,85045105816,2018,,,,,,
"© 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: This paper aims to propose an empirically grounded governance framework based on complex adaptive systems (CAS) principles to facilitate formation of well-connected regional supply chains that foster economic development, adaptability and resilience of mining regions. Design/methodology/approach: This study is an exploratory case study of the South Australian (SA) mining industry that includes 38 semi-structured interviews with the key stakeholders and structural analysis of the regional supply network (RSN). Findings: Findings demonstrate the applicability of the CAS framework as a structured approach to the governance of the mining industry regional supply chains. In particular, the findings exemplify the relationship between RSN governance, its structure and interconnectivity and their combined impact on the adaptability and resilience of mining regions. Research limitations/implications: The data set analysed in the current study is static. Longitudinal data would permit a deeper insight into the evolution of the RSN structure and connectivity. The validity of the proposed framework could be further strengthened by being applied to other industrial domains and geographical contexts. Practical/implications: The proposed framework offers a novel insight for regional policy-makers striving to create an environment that facilitates the formation of well-integrated regional supply chains in mining regions through more focussed policy and strategies. Originality/value: The proposed framework is one of the first attempts to offer a holistic structured approach to governance of the regional supply chains based on CAS principles.

"© 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature. In a competitive environment, supply chains are competing with each other to gain the market share and competition is a critical factor influencing the supply chain network structure. The current paper presents a variational inequality formulation and provides the results for a competitive supply chain network design model. The new-entrant supply chain competes against an existing one in a non-cooperative behavior. The networks include raw material suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, and the same demand markets. The manufacturers produce multiple products with deterministic, price-dependent demand. The goal is to maximize the future revenue of both chains. The problem is modeled by mathematical programming and the governing Nash equilibrium conditions are derived. Then, a finite-dimensional variational inequality formulation is presented to solve the equilibrium problem. Qualitative properties of the equilibrium pattern are provided to establish existence and uniqueness results under reasonable conditions. The modified projection algorithm is used to solve the variational inequality problem. A numerical example is presented in order to show the efficiency of the proposed model and to investigate the behavior of the model under different conditions.","A variational inequality formulation for designing a multi-echelon, multi-product supply chain network in a competitive environment",Dynamic competition *** Modified projection method *** Multi-product *** Nash equilibrium *** Supply chain network design (SCND) *** Variational inequality,annals of operations research,85039065424,2018,,,,,,
"Copyright © 2018 John Wiley  &  Sons, Ltd. Biofuel supply chain design plays a critical role in facilitating the large-scale substitution of biofuel for traditional fossil fuels with a cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner towards sustainability. This paper proposes a multiobjective optimization model for a 4-layer biofuel supply chain network using mixed integer nonlinear programming while considering the benefits from economic, environmental, and societal aspects. The model can be used either to optimize an existing biofuel supply chain network or to guide the construction of a new biofuel supply chain network. The profit, the greenhouse gas emissions in transportation, and the market share of biofuel were set as targets for optimization. The selection of the participators at each layer, and the amount of the material flow between each pair of selected supplier and customer located at two adjacent layers were modeled as decision variables. The conventional weighted aggregation method was used to unify 3 objectives after normalization. Particle swarm optimization was used to solve this high-dimension multiobjective problem to obtain a near optimal solution. A numerical case study based on the state of Missouri in the United States was implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results of the case study illustrate that the benefits in terms of transportation emission, profit, and market share can be achieved simultaneously. Using the equal weights configuration in conventional weighted aggregation as an example, a 21% reduction of the transportation emission, a 33% increase of the profit, and a 2% augmentation of the market share were achieved compared to the benchmark scenario.","Biofuel supply chain optimal design considering economic, environmental, and societal aspects towards sustainability",biofuel supply chain *** greenhouse gas emission *** multiobjective optimization *** particle swarm optimization *** sustainability,international journal of energy research,85042166983,2018,,,,,,

Fuzzy set theory is applied to avoid the vagueness and uncertainty in human preference judgement. This study uses an empirical case study of an Indian automobile organization to validate the applicability of the proposed model. The results show that the resource based strategy is in first position, having the maximum impact on each determinant. The case organization should improve the green management system with the assistance of a suitable GSCM strategy, i.e. the resource based strategy.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a methodology to analyze the risks present in perishable food supply chain and to determine the most effective risk mitigation strategies. It is achieved by understanding the dynamics between various risks in perishable food supply chain and modeling them using interpretive structural modeling (ISM). Design/methodology/approach - Four categories and 17 types of risk are established from literature and conducting brainstorming sessions with managers/engineers in Indian dairy firms. A methodology is proposed using ISM, risk priority number and risk mitigation number to prioritize risk mitigation strategy decisions for the dairy industry. Findings - For a perishable food supply chain, risk positioned at lower levels (levels 1 or 2) in the hierarchy should be targeted first, while formulating mitigation strategies. To investigate further, risk-enabling factors which are identified for an Indian dairy firm for these levels 1 and 2 risks and mitigation strategy prioritization show that supplier side risks are more dominant followed by market risks and process risks. Research limitations/implications - This proposed methodology has not been statistically validated or empirically tested, and factors taken are in the Indian context, but the authors believe that the study is highly relevant to other markets as well because the ISM-based analysis is for generic perishable food supply chain environment. Practical implications - This study provides a useful approach to managers/decision makers to identify, analyze and prioritize risk in the supply chain. It also provides insights into the mutual relationships of supply chain risks which would help them to focus on the effective risk mitigation strategies formulation. The study provides the insights to benchmark and risk management in the dairy industry environment with priority considerations.

"In this paper, we investigated a third-party logistics (3PL) provider evaluation problem considering social sustainability as one of the important evaluation criteria. Since the 3PL service is mainly dependent on both transport vehicles and employees, managing them from the viewpoint of social sustainability has become a critical issue. Thus, 3PL providers need to be concerned about not only the service price or quality but also issues related to social sustainability. In line with this trend, we defined the social sustainability of 3PL providers and related evaluation criteria. In addition, a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used as a main evaluation framework to help decision-makers determine the relative importance of each criteria or alternative using linguistic terms. To show the feasibility of the proposed criteria and evaluation framework, we presented the illustrative example based on a real-world case. The results showed that the proposed approach could be a good alternative to conduct evaluations, and the related sensitivity analysis, considering social sustainability.",Evaluation of Third Party Logistics Providers Considering Social Sustainability,third-party logistics service *** social sustainability *** fuzzy analytic hierarchy process,sustainability,WOS:000404127800102,2017,0,0,0,,,
"Effective and efficient measurement and determination of critical quality parameter(s) is the key to improve the traceability and transparency of the table grapes quality as well as the sustainability performance of the table grapes cold chain logistics, and ensure the table grapes quality and safety. This paper is to determine the critical quality parameter(s) in the cold chain logistics through the real time monitoring of the temperature fluctuation implemented with the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), and the correlation analysis among the various quality parameters. The assessment was conducted through three experiments. Experiment I indicated that the temperature have a large fluctuation from 0 degrees C to 30 degrees C, and the critical temperatures could be determined as 0 degrees C, 5 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C. Experiment II described that the firmness and moisture loss rate, whose Pearson correlation coefficient with the sensory evaluation. were all greater than 0.9 at the critical temperatures determined in Experiment I, could be the critical quality parameters. Experiment III illustrated that the critical quality parameters, firmness and moisture loss rate, could be reliable indicators of table grapes quality by the Arrhenius kinetic equation, and results showed that the evaluation model based on the firmness is better to predict the shelf life than that based on the moisture loss rate. The best quality table grapes could be provided for the consumers via the easily and directly tracing and controlling the critical quality parameters in real time in actual cold chain logistics.

"The quality of the supplier base affects the competitiveness of firms and the attendant supply chain. The supplier selection decision is key to effective supply chain management. This paper investigates the problem of supplier selection under multi-source procurement for a type of divisible goods (such as coal, oil, and natural gas). By considering both the risk attributes and the attributes under a commercial criterion, we design a new two-stage compound mechanism for supplier selection based on multi-attribute auction and supply chain risk management. In the first stage, a multi-auction mechanism is established to determine the shortlist among all qualified suppliers based on four attributes (quality, price, quantity flexibility, and delivery time reliability) under a commercial criterion. In the second stage, seven risk attributes against the shortlisted suppliers are further considered, and a new ranking method based on grey correlation degree of mixed sequence is proposed to rank the finalists and to select the final winners. Moreover, the implementation, availability, and feasibility of the two-stage compound mechanism are highlighted by using an example of the multi-source procurement of electricity coal. This presented compound mechanism may well improve the procurement efficiency of divisible goods and greatly reduce the procurement risk. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Fractional metrics, such as return on investment (ROI), are widely used for performance evaluation, but uncertainty in the real market may unfortunately diminish the results that are based on nominal parameters. This article addresses the optimal design of a large-scale processing network for producing a variety of algae-based fuels and value-added bioproducts under uncertainty. We develop by far the most comprehensive processing network with 46,704 alternative processing pathways. Based on the superstructure, a two-stage adaptive robust mixed integer fractional programming model is proposed to tackle the uncertainty and select the robust optimal processing pathway with the highest ROI. Since the proposed problem cannot be solved directly by any off-the-shelf solver, we develop an efficient tailored solution method that integrates a parametric algorithm with a column-and-constraint generation algorithm. The resulting robust optimal processing pathway selects biodiesel and poly-3-hydroxybutyrate as the final fuel and bioproduct, respectively.

"This study presents a joint three-echelon location inventory model for a donation-demand driven industry in which the main warehouse (MW), distribution centers (DC), retail stores (RS) and donation-only centers (ADCs) exist. This unique inventory-location problem involves demand and supply uncertainties, coverage radius limitations, service level requirements, and multiple products consideration. Each retailer has two classes of products flowing from the assigned DC due to demands minus donations occurring in that retailer. The proposed model simultaneously determines the number of DCs to open, DC locations, and assignments of retailers to the open DCs for particular product types. The objective is to minimize the total annual cost including: facility location costs, transportation costs, inventory costs, and the lost sale costs. Due to the complexity of the problem, the proposed model structure allows for relaxing complicating constraints through recourse to Lagrangian relaxation. The use of robust branch-cut and price heuristics solves the mixed integer nonlinear problem to obtain a lower bound and a distance-based heuristic to get an upper bound. We formulate essential features of this novel problem, solve several numerical example problems and evaluate solution performance. We believe this is a novel problem environment, and that this initial study extends integrated location-inventory modeling to a new context. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"We propose a decentralized belief propagation-based method, PD-LBP, for multi-agent task allocation in open and dynamic grid and cloud environments where both the sets of agents and tasks constantly change. PD-LBP aims at accelerating the online response to, improving the resilience from the unpredicted changing in the environments, and reducing the message passing for task allocation. To do this, PD-LBP devises two phases, pruning and decomposition. The pruning phase focuses on reducing the search space through pruning the resource providers, and the decomposition addresses decomposing the network into multiple independent parts where belief propagation can be operated in parallel. Comparison between PD-LBP and two other state-of-the-art methods, Loopy Belief Propagation-based method and Reduced Binary Loopy Belief Propagation based method, is performed. The evaluation results demonstrate the desirable efficiency of PD-LBP from both the shorter problem solving time and smaller communication requirement of task allocation in dynamic environments.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to enhance understanding on supply chain partnership strategy-environment context co-alignment and its relationship with performance. Using the environment-strategy-performance view framework and the supporting relational perspective, the study develops a model and hypotheses to understand how supply chain partnership strategy as a response to co-align with operating context elements may impact operational and overall firm performance. Additionally, the study investigates the interrelationships among partnership strategy elements. Design/methodology/approach - Data for testing the hypothesized relationships in the conceptual model was collected through a survey of managers in the Hoover's database of US manufacturing firms. The survey sample included 115 responses from a wide variety of manufacturing forms. Findings - Findings support the conventional wisdom relating collaboration to operational and financial performance. While product complexity associates with the building block resources, resource complementarity and resource specificity, technological turbulence relates significantly with only resource specificity. Interestingly, competitive intensity associates differentially with the resources - positive with resource specificity and negatively with resource complementarity. The results also reveal mediating influences of resource specificity and collaboration. Research limitations/implications - The research findings have to be considered in context. The moderate size, wide industry/firm diversity and robust research design notwithstanding, and the cross-firm nature can potentially obscure causal linkages. Besides, more comprehensive insights could be obtained by modeling the co-alignment of strategy with other factors in the operating context such as industry munificence, and market unpredictability. Practical implications - Firms derive operational and financial performance benefits from close collaboration with partners since the operational enhancements from such relationships have customer service implications. Besides, the synergistic interrelationships among strategic partnership resources and their eventual impact on operational and financial performance is highlighted suggesting that firms develop a proper mix of unique and complementing set of resources and leverage them through collaborative behaviors. Importantly, the results provide a framework for managers to understand the criticality of aligning their resources with contextual elements to realize enhanced operational efficiencies, customer service, and financial benefits. Originality/value - Much of the evidence on the rent generation capabilities in supply chain partnerships is still anecdotal and extant empirical research lacks adequate explanation. Thus this study offers an initial strategic response framework for an appropriate co-alignment of partnership resources with environmental context factors to realize operational benefits and overall financial performance. The framework answers the critical question: does a supply chain partnership strategy that matches fit or co-aligns with its critical operating environment context realize better performance? Additionally, it unravels the interrelationships among strategic partnership resources.",Performance impact of supply chain partnership strategy-environment co-alignment,Operational performance *** Financial performance *** Manufacturing firms *** Environment-strategy co-alignment *** Environment-strategy-performance perspective,international journal of operations & production management,WOS:000407283600006,2017,,,,,,
"Due to increased customer knowledge and ecological pressures from markets and various stakeholders, business organizations have emphasized the importance of greening and sustainability in their supply chain through supplier selection. Therefore, a systematic and sustainability-focused evaluation system for supplier selection is needed from an organizational supply chain perspective. This work proposes a framework to evaluate sustainable supplier selection by using an integrated Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), ViseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), a multi-criteria optimization and compromise solution approach. Initially, 22 sustainable supplier selection criteria and three dimensions of criteria (economic, environmental, and social) have been identified through literature and experts' opinions. A real world example of an automobile company in India is discussed to demonstrate the proposed framework applicability. According to the findings, 'Environmental costs; 'Quality of product,' 'Price of product' Occupational health and safety systems,' and 'Environmental competencies' have been ranked as the top five sustainable supplier selection criteria. In addition, out of the five sustainable supplier's alternatives, supplier number 'three' got the highest rank. The work presented in this paper may help managers and business professionals not only to distinguish the important supplier selection criteria but also to evaluate the most efficient supplier for sustainability in supply chain, while remaining competitive in the market. Sensitivity analysis is also conducted to test the proposed framework robustness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Innovation has always been considerably risky; however, managing Research and Development (R&D) project risks has become even more important given today's tight schedules and limited resources. Risk management has to be an integral part of the development process. The purpose of this research is to develop a model to assess and estimate the risk exposure of an R&D project. A risk quantification model based on the Bayesian belief network is proposed, which is effective in capturing the interaction between various risk factors.

"This paper introduces the problem of designing a single-product supply chain network in an agile manufacturing setting under a vendor managed inventory (VMI) strategy to seize a new market opportunity. The problem addresses the level of risk aversion of the retailer when dealing with the uncertainty of market related information through a conditional value at risk (CVaR) approach. This approach leads to a bilevel programming problem. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are employed to transform the model into a single-level, mixed-integer linear programming problem by considering some relaxations. Since realizations of imprecisely known parameters are the only information available, a data-driven approach is employed as a suitable, more practical, methodology of avoiding distributional assumptions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated through a numerical example.",ROBUST BILEVEL OPTIMIZATION FOR AN OPPORTUNISTIC SUPPLY CHAIN NETWORK DESIGN PROBLEM IN AN UNCERTAIN AND RISKY ENVIRONMENT,supply chain management *** production-distribution planning *** conditional value at risk *** bilevel programming *** robust optimization *** KKT conditions,operations research and decisions,WOS:000400812100002,2017,,,,,,

"The researchers of classical multidimensional knapsack problem have always assumed that the weights, values, and capacities are constant values. However, in the real-life industrial engineering applications, the multidimensional knapsack problem often comes with uncertainty about a lack of information about these parameters. This paper investigates a constrained multidimensional knapsack problem under uncertain environment, in which the relevant parameters are assumed to be uncertain variables. Within the framework of uncertainty theory, two types of uncertain programming models with discount constraints are constructed for the problem with different decision criteria, including the expected value criterion and the critical value criterion. Taking full advantage of the operational law for uncertain variables, the proposed models can be transformed into their corresponding deterministic models. After theoretically investigating the properties of the models, we do some numerical experiments. The numerical results illustrate that the proposed models are feasible and efficient for solving the constrained multidimensional knapsack problem with uncertain parameters.

"Eco-Industrial parks (EIPs) and industrial symbioses (IS) provide cost-effective and environmental friendly solutions for industries. They bring benefits from industrial plants to industrial parks and neighborhood areas. The exchange of materials, water, and energy is the goal of IS to reduce wastes, by-products, and energy consumption among a cluster of industries. However, although the IS design looks for the best set of flow exchanges among industries at a network level, the lack of access to accurate data challenges the optimal design of a new EIP. IS solutions face uncertainties. Considering the huge cost and long establishment time of IS, the existing studies cannot provide a robust model to investigate effects of uncertainty on the optimal symbioses design. This paper introduces a framework to investigate uncertainties in the EIP design. A multi-objective model is proposed to decide the optimal network of symbiotic exchanges among firms. The model minimizes the costs of multiple product exchanges and environmental impacts of flow exchanges. Moreover, this paper integrates the analysis of uncertainties effects on synergies into the modeling process. The presented models are depicted through optimizing energy synergies of an industrial zone in France. The efficiency of single and multiple objective models is analyzed for the effects of the identified uncertainties. In addition, the presented deterministic and robust models are compared to investigate how the uncertainties affect the performance and configuration of an optimal network. It is believed that the models could improve an EIP's resilience under uncertainties.",Improving the Resilience of Energy Flow Exchanges in Eco-Industrial Parks: Optimization Under Uncertainty, ,asce-asme journal of risk and uncertainty in engineering systems part b-mechanical engineering,WOS:000404891500003,2017,,,,,,

"Disasters are on the increase globally with accompanying devastating effects on dairy supply chains. The devastating effects, caused by disasters on economies in various countries such as United States of America, Japan, Kenya, Uganda, Mozambique and Zimbabwe call for urgent sustainable mitigating measures in disaster risk reduction. These countries have experienced notable natural and man-made disasters in the past. The disasters negatively impacted the economies of both developed and developing countries, causing misery to people as hunger and poverty drastically increased. Zimbabwe's dairy industry was not spared from these devastating effects as it was vulnerable to disasters such as droughts and cyclones. Disasters adversely affected supply chains in the country as evidenced by the closure of some dairy firms between the years 2000 and 2014. This article is set against the backdrop of declining output across all agricultural sectors in Zimbabwe, evident particularly in the dairy farming sector which has witnessed inadequate supply of raw milk and dairy products by local producers. The article assesses the impact of dairy organisations' partnerships with government departments and non-governmental organisations in reducing disaster risks on the dairy supply chain cost efficiency. It also aims to show how partnerships can reduce disaster risks and weighs the benefits of reduced supply chain costs in improving the affordability of milk and milk products to the general public. The study employs a mixed-methods approach comprising structured questionnaires, administered to a sample of 92 respondents out of a randomly sampled population of 122 participants from dairy farming clusters across the country, with an 85% response rate. Key informants in the form of 18 dairy officers were purposively sampled for interviews throughout the dairy farming regions.

"In this study, we revisit the relationship between analyst firm coverage and forecast accuracy. In contrast to the proposed negative association in Clement (1999) owing to the portfolio complexity effect, we hypothesize an economy-of-scale effect' that is likely to dominate when analysts rely mostly on public information. In support of the latter effect, we find a positive association between firm coverage and forecast accuracy after the enactment of Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD), which substantially reduces the flow of material private information to analysts. Such a result survives a battery of robustness analyses. We further show that, in the post-Reg FD period, covering more firms increases an analyst's probability of being selected as a star analyst in the subsequent year. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of the information environment in shaping the economic link between an analyst's firm coverage and forecast accuracy.",Analyst Firm Coverage and Forecast Accuracy: The Effect of Regulation Fair Disclosure,Analyst portfolio *** Forecast accuracy *** Information complementarity *** Regulation FD,abacus-a journal of accounting finance and business studies,WOS:000418066000002,2017,,,,,,
"The purpose of this study is to design a four-echelon supply chain network in which operational and financial dimensions have been considered by a holistic, comprehensive and rigorous viewpoint within tactical and. strategic decision-making levels. In this process, the aforementioned dimensions are extended and integrated in mathematical modeling framework. The research modeling is compared with traditional approaches, which merely rely on operational dimension to optimize profit and due to problems in profit, the research objectives changed to the multiple objectives of corporate value, change in equity and economic value added. Within this framework, a comparison is primarily made between profit and each of corporate value, change in equity and economic value added two by two (in the form of traditional approach (scenario A) and new approach (scenario B)). Then the objectives are simultaneously assessed and a compromise is gained among them through fuzzy goal programming. In this process, the effectiveness and efficiency of the scenario B is analyzed and assessed. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is performed on such factors as demand, return of equity rate, tax rate, production capacity and supplier capacity while the impacts of their changes on multi-objective function and satisfaction coefficient are simultaneously calculated. The mathematical model in the study is multi-product and multi-period while the values of parameters are determined under definite circumstances. For modeling and solving the mathematical model, GAMS 24 software and CPLEX solver are employed. To test the model, data of an Iranian petrochemical company are used. Besides highlighting the significance of the financial dimension and its integration with the operational dimension in gaining sustainable competitive advantage, the research results revealed that CVM- in contrast to change in equity and EVA- is much more favorable than the other objectives. Similarly, changes in demand had more favorable effects on multi-objective analysis.",Optimal design of a multi-echelon supply chain in a system thinking framework: An integrated financial-operational approach,Multi-echelon supply chain system *** Mathematical modeling *** Integrated financial/operational approach *** Fuzzy goal programming,computers & industrial engineering,WOS:000418314300026,2017,,,,,,
"Remanufacturing is of great importance for environmental protection and sustainable development, while the uncertainty in returns' quality has brought huge challenge for the design and operation of remanufacturing systems. By considering returns' quality, this study is to optimize the buffer allocation with maximum throughput rate and minimum work in process (WIP) concurrently. Decomposition-extension-Markov approach is adopted to establish the model and obtain the performance of the system. A novel tabu search non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (TS-NSGA II) is put forward to search the optimal solution, and the Pareto-optimal solutions are obtained. A case study is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The main findings of the study are as follows: (1) Compared with the previous studies, a Pareto optimization can maintain the diversity of the solutions, thus it is favorable to make better decisions for multi-objective buffer allocation. (2) TS-NSGA II can obtain optimal solutions closely enough to the Pareto frontier, and it has significant advantages in convergence, diversity and running time. (3) Buffer capacity and its allocation have important effect on the performance of remanufacturing system. For WIP, the buffer capacity is the most critical influence factor; for the throughput ratio and discarded ratio, buffer capacity is the secondary factor just behind the process route. The above achievements provide an valuable reference for the optimal design of remanufacturing system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"In the European Union, approximately 3.6 million tonnes of used tires are generated annually. Because used tires are not biodegradable, there is strong motivation to successfully manage this fast-growing waste flow. One of the most popular approaches for sustainable environmental stewardship of used tires is retreading. The problem investigated in this paper is to identify optimized purchasing, retreading, and inventory planning schemes of used tires in multiple tire retreading plants as well as allocation patterns of retreaded, reusable, and end-of-life tires that secure maximized profit within a multi-period planning horizon and under multiple uncertainties. This paper proposes an interval-parameter semi-infinite programming model for used tire management and planning. The underlying difference between this model and those developed in previous research is its ability to consider the effects of external impact factors related to complicated economic, environmental, and social activities on used tire management systems. Moreover, it can successfully handle real-life uncertainties of the used tire management systems expressed as functional and crisp intervals. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the developed model. Flexible long-term purchasing, retreading, inventory, and allocation plans, which are adjustable with variations of external impact factors, are obtained. The presented model has advantages in addressing the dynamic complexity of used tire management systems by introducing the functional interval parameters associated with the price of a new tire as well as electricity and gas prices and labor costs in waste management and transportation sectors. Compared with the available models, the resulting solutions are far more robust because they are able to satisfy all possible levels of external impact factors. The presented model is beneficial for the tire retreading industry, which processes millions of used tires annually. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"Increasing worldwide environmental and social concerns are motivating manufacturers and consumers to implement recycling strategies such as product recovery, waste management or usage of recycled materials. Besides environmental and social concerns, in some countries legislations also force recycling of products such as end-of-life vehicles (ELVs). Automotive manufactures in Turkey are responsible for free take-back of ELVs from consumers to reintegrate used parts into industry according to ELVs regulation by Republic of Turkey Ministry of Environment and Urbanization. Regarding mentioned motivation, in this study a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) is presented, based on a case study considering the ELVs treatment in Turkey. A linear programming (LP) model is developed to handle the reverse material flows with regard to reintegrate them into forward supply chains. Several CLSC scenarios are discussed to show the performance of the proposed model and its applicability in the automotive industry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"While biomass has been recognized as an important renewable energy source which has a range of positive impacts on the economy, environment, and society, the existence of feedstock seasonality and risk of service disruptions at collection facilities potentially compromises the efficiency and reliability of the energy supply system. In this paper, we consider reliable supply chain design for biomass collection against feedstock seasonality and time-varying disruption risks. We optimize facility location, inventory, biomass quantity, and shipment decisions in a multi-period planning horizon setting. A real-world case in Hubei, China is studied to offer managerial insights. Our computational results show that: (1) the disruption risk significantly affects both the optimal facility locations and the supply chain cost; (2) no matter how the failure probability changes, setting backup facilities can significantly decrease the total cost; and (3) the feedstock seasonality does not affect locations of the collection facilities, but it affects the allocations of collection facilities and brings higher inventory cost for the biomass supply chain.",Reliable Biomass Supply Chain Design under Feedstock Seasonality and Probabilistic Facility Disruptions,biomass *** supply chain *** inventory *** facility location *** seasonality *** disruption risk,energies,WOS:000417046500214,2017,,,,,,
"Industry is double-edge sword to urban sustainability: on the one hand, it provides employment and GDP economic, one the other hand, brings pollutions to cities. The concept of urban industrial symbiosis offers a smart solution for city to coordinate the relationship among industries and between industry and city. While internationally, this idea has been promoted more than two decades, in China, which is ideal laboratory to test such practices, related research is rather few, especially quantitative studies. With this circumstance, this study conducts a case study to test the urban industrial symbiosis promotion in one typical industrial city named Liuzhou, in southern China, of which heavy industries play an important role. A hybrid evaluation model integrating process based life cycle assessment (LCA) and input-output (IO) model is established to assess the environmental benefits in the whole supply chain. Based on local conditions, innovative urban industrial symbiosis is designed and analyzed. Five new waste/energy synergies named waste plastics recycling, scrap tire recycling, coal flying ash recycling, biomass utilization and carbon capture by slag carbonization are selected for scenarios analysis. We particular focus on the carbon mitigations. Compared with business as usual scenario, planned symbiosis enables to reduce CO2 emissions by 29.66, 557.42 and 520.13 kt-CO2/year in power purchase, material consumption and waste disposal stage. Results highlight that urban industrial symbiosis is not only able to green the industries, but also utilize industry contribute to urban development. Finally, policy implications and countermeasures to address the barriers of promoting the urban industrial symbiosis are discussed. Our research would be critical for future sustainable urban planning and shed a light on regional eco-industrial development in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

"Water loss through leaking pipes constitutes a major challenge to the operational service of water utilities. In recent years, increasing concern about the financial loss and environmental pollution caused by leaking pipes has been driving the development of efficient algorithms for detecting leakage in water piping networks. Water distribution networks (WDNs) are disperse in nature with numerous number of nodes and branches. Consequently, identifying the segment(s) of the network and the exact leaking pipelines connected to this segment(s) where higher background leakage outflow occurs is a challenging task. Background leakage concerns the outflow from small cracks or deteriorated joints. In addition, because they are diffuse flow, they are not characterised by quick pressure drop and are not detectable by measuring instruments. Consequently, they go unreported for a long period of time posing a threat to water loss volume. Most of the existing research focuses on the detection and localisation of burst type leakages which are characterised by a sudden pressure drop. In this work, an algorithm for detecting and estimating background leakage in water distribution networks is presented. The algorithm integrates a leakage model into a classical WDN hydraulic model for solving the network leakage flows. The applicability of the developed algorithm is demonstrated on two different water networks. The results of the tested networks are discussed and the solutions obtained show the benefits of the proposed algorithm. A noteworthy evidence is that the algorithm permits the detection of critical segments or pipes of the network experiencing higher leakage outflow and indicates the probable pipes of the network where pressure control can be performed. However, the possible position of pressure control elements along such critical pipes will be addressed in future work.",Leakage Detection and Estimation Algorithm for Loss Reduction in Water Piping Networks,hydraulic model *** pipe leakage *** leakage detection *** leakage estimation *** water distribution systems *** water loss,water,WOS:000414707500050,2017,,,,,,
"The resilient recovery is of great necessity and importance to supply network with uncertainty. Outer synchronization helps the supply network restores the scheduled status. Also it has absorptive and adaptive capacity. This paper proposes a resilient recovery method based on outer synchronization. Different from previous schemes, a research on supply networks with time delay, unknown parameters and structural variation has been conducted. A dynamic model of the supply network is established, in which each node is represented as a Lorenz system. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, an impulsive pinning controller is designed for resilient recovery. Numerical simulations and related case study are used to verify the validity of the proposed model and the resilient recovery method. Experimental results show that, the proposed method can realize the parameter identification and effective recovery with various uncertain environments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

"The food sector has a prodigious focus and is constantly gaining in importance in today's global economic marketplace. Due to an increasing global population, society faces a greater challenge for sustainable food production, quality, distribution, and food safety in the food supply chain. Adopting green supply chain management (GSCM) elements is essential for utilizing the food supply chain in an environmentally benign way. As a solution to the above challenge, the economic and green characteristics for supplier selection in green purchasing are studied in this paper. For an organization, the evaluation and selection of the green supplier is a vital issue due to several tangible and intangible criteria involved. Accordingly, we apply multiple criteria decision aiding techniques. We propose a hybrid approach that combines the revised Simos procedure, PROMETHEE methods, algorithms for constructing a group compromise ranking, and robustness analysis. At first, the revised Simos procedure is used to derive the criteria weights. Next, the PROMETHEE method is applied to rank the suppliers according to each Decision Maker's (DM's) preferences. Then, the compromise ranking is constructed to minimize the distance of the individual's rankings from the solution adopted by the whole group. For this purpose, we introduce and apply some original procedures based on Binary Linear Programming. Finally, the results are validated against the outcomes of robustness analysis. The applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach is endorsed with a case study in an Indian food industry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"The use of integrated bioenergy systems (IBS) is a prospective solution to address the emergent global demand for clean energy. The sustainability of IBS compared to stand-alone biomass processing facilities is achieved through integration of process units or component plants via their bioenergy products, by-products, wastes, and common utilities. However, such increased component interdependency makes the resulting integrated energy system vulnerable to capacity disruptions. IBS in particular are vulnerable to climate change-induced events (e.g., drought) that reduce the availability of biomass feedstocks in bioenergy production. Cascading failure due to such supply-side disruptive event is an inherent risk in IBS and may pose a barrier to the commercial-scale adoption of such systems. A previous study developed a risk-based criticality index to quantify the effect of a component's disruption within integrated energy systems. This index is used to rank the component's relative risk in the network based on the ripple effects of its disruption. In this work, a novel P-graph approach is proposed as an alternative methodology for criticality analysis of component units or plants in an IBS. This risk-based metric can be used for developing risk management polices to protect critical facilities, thereby increasing the robustness of IBS against disruptions. Two case studies on determining the criticality index of process units in an integrated biorefinery and component plants in a bioenergy park are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.",P-graph approach to criticality analysis in integrated bioenergy systems,P-graph *** Criticality analysis *** Risk analysis *** Bioenergy parks *** Integrated biorefinery,clean technologies and environmental policy,WOS:000407230900004,2017,,,,,,
"Attention to environmental sustainability represents an essential issue for the companies that, in order to integrate environment into their strategies, are producing specific innovations that have also positive environmental outcomes. Implementing green innovations represents a great challenge for non-green companies because it often requires the acquisition of new resources and competences that differ significantly from their existing competences. This paper attempts to propose a theoretical framework that classifies green innovations according their impact on company's competences and analyses how green innovations can be implemented. Given the complexity of the issue and the variability of situations, we use a multiple case study analysis of several green innovations developed in a non-green industry, namely the automotive sector. Indeed, this is one that produces the highest environmental impact and, in recent years, it has been subjected to increasing regulatory restrictions. Companies operating in a non-green industry that implement disruptive, radical and architectural green innovations can initiate market and technological partnerships to mitigate against such internal weaknesses, such as the lack of technological capabilities and market knowledge. The collaboration helps firms to access new competences and capabilities useful to change or develop new technology capabilities and market knowledge more easily and with lower costs.",Types of Green Innovations: Ways of Implementation in a Non-Green Industry,green innovation *** collaboration *** partnership *** automotive industry,sustainability,WOS:000408861800016,2017,,,,,,
"This paper explores the conditions favouring or inhibiting the implementation of strategic corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies in the context of global value chains (GVCs). Using transaction cost theory (TCT), we specify the economic and behavioural issues raised by strategic CSR policies. We show that the existence of market rewards for such policies does not constitute a solution per se, but tends to increase the difficulties that value chain members face. Bringing TCT into the analysis of the diffusion of strategic CSR policies in GVCs helps us to make different contributions. We first theoretically identify some limiting conditions of strategic CSR policies in GVCs. We also contribute to developing a more robust theoretical perspective for CSR in GVC research, which remains underdeveloped and mostly driven by empirical case studies. Finally, we shed light on new research questions and topics that could guide major theoretical and empirical investigations in the capacity of GVCs members to bypass the numerous difficulties involved in the implementation of strategic CSR policies.",Sharing the Shared Value: A Transaction Cost Perspective on Strategic CSR Policies in Global Value Chains,Global value chains *** Strategic corporate social responsibility *** Transaction cost theory *** Asset specificity *** Governance structure,journal of business ethics,WOS:000406195300010,2017,,,,,,
"The stability of the core ecological industry chain plays a critical role to optimize the ecological industry chain (EIC) network. Vast majority of existing studies paid close attention to the design of nodes in terms of economic and environmental improvements. By contrast, the optimization of core industrial chain is largely overlooked. A novel methodology is proposed in this study to assist the core ecological industry chain design where resources, economy and environment are set as the constraints. Ecological industry chain efficiency is evaluated by Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) where constraint conditions gradually superimposed into the core ecological industry chain. This methodology is validated through an empirical case study. Results showed that the relative efficiency of the core ecological industry chain consisted of Chlorine Alkali Plant-Alumina Plant-Electrolytic Aluminum Plant-Aluminum Deep Processing Plant is close to 1. This core ecological industry chain achieved the coordinated development among economic, energy and environment. It belongs to the typical value-added design of EIC. The relative efficiency of the core ecological industry chains consisted of Lime Plant-Calcium Carbide Plant Polyvinyl Chloride Plant and Chlorine Alkali Plant- Polyvinyl Chloride Plant-Density Board Plant is 0.8690 and 0.7956, respectively. These core ecological industry chains can be further improved by means of continuous optimization design, i.e., introducing key fill chain links to rearrange the upstream and downstream enterprises. These findings provide useful references for the EIPs development and related policy making. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"Collaborative logistics networks (CLNs) are considered to be an effective organizational form for business cooperation that provides high stability and low cost. One common key issue regarding CLN resource combination is the network design optimization problem under discrete uncertainty (DU-CLNDOP). Operational environment changes and information uncertainty in network designs, due to partner selection, resource constrains and network robustness, must be effectively controlled from the system perspective. Therefore, a general two-stage quantitative framework that enables decision makers to select the optimal network design scheme for CLNs under uncertainty is proposed in this paper. Phase 1 calculates the simulation result of each hypothetical scenario of CLN resource combination using the expected value model with robust constraints. Phase 2 selects the optimal network design scheme for DU-CLNDOP using the orthogonal experiment design method. The validity of the model and method are verified via an illustrative example.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assist a manufacturing firm in designing the closed-loop supply chain network under risks that are affecting its supply quality and logistics operations. The modeling approach adopted aims at the embedding supply chain risks in a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network design process and suggests optimal supply chain configuration and risk mitigation strategies. Design/methodology/approach - The method proposes a closed-loop supply chain network and identifies the network parameter and variables required for closing the loop. Mixed-integer-linear-programming-based mathematical modeling approach is used to formulate the research problem. The solutions and test results are obtained from CPLEX solver. Findings - The outcomes of the proposed model were demonstrated through a case study conducted in an Indian hospital furniture manufacturing firm. The modern supply chain is mapped to make it closed loop, and potential risks in its supply chain are identified. The supply chain network of the firm is redesigned through embedding risk in the modeling process. It was found that companies can be in great profit if they follow closed-loop practices and simultaneously keep a check on risks as well. The cost of making the supply chain risk averse was found to be insignificant. Practical implications - Although the study was conducted in a practical case situation, the obtained results are not indiscriminate to the other circumstances. However, the approach followed and proposed methodology can be applied to many industries once a firm decides to redesign its supply chain for closing its loop or model under risks. Originality/value - By using the identified CLSC parameters and applying the proposed network design methodology, a firm can design/redesign their supply chain network to counter the risk and accordingly come up with planned mitigation strategies to achieve a certain degree of robustness.",Embedding risk in closed-loop supply chain network design Case of a hospital furniture manufacturer,Supply chain risk *** Mixed-integer linear programming *** Closed-Loop supply chain *** Hospital furniture *** Supply chain modelling *** Supply chain network design,journal of modelling in management,WOS:000412339600011,2017,,,,,,

"Because of the critical role of safe and reliable truck movements in sustainable economic growth, public- and private-sector transportation managers continually monitor and evaluate the efficiency of the national roadway system. A key impediment to nimble supply chains is the level of traffic congestion experienced on U.S. roadways and the subsequent costs that are incurred because of that congestion. To facilitate the development of a methodology for quantifying congestion, a standardized approach is presented for calculating congestion figures that are comparative on a year-over-year basis. With this methodology, time delays on the National Highway System in 2014 were calculated at more than 728 million hours, equating to approximately $49.6 billion in increased congestion-related costs to the trucking industry. The congestion was heavily concentrated in urban areas, with 88.1% of the total cost occurring on only 17.6% of the National Highway System network. The lost productivity is equivalent to 264,781 commercial truck drivers sitting idle for an entire working year. Additionally, the average truck experienced an increased cost of $4,546 because of congestion, a figure that varied widely depending on the number of miles a particular truck traveled in a particular area. Finally, the presented standardized methodology enables 2014 to be used as a base year for comparison with future years, allowing for the monitoring of congestion effects over time. As a result, transportation planners and managers can evaluate system metrics such as planning efficiency and productivity for a longer time. The methodology also supports assessment of shorter-term events, such as natural disasters and infrastructure improvement projects.",Estimating the Cost of Congestion to the Trucking Industry Standardized Methodology for Congestion Monitoring and Monetization, ,transportation research record,WOS:000413600500006,2017,,,,,,
"© 2016 by Yale University Life cycle assessment (LCA) and urban metabolism (UM) are popular approaches for urban system environmental assessment. However, both approaches have challenges when used across spatial scales. LCA tends to decompose systemic information into micro-level functional units that mask complexity and purpose, whereas UM typically equates aggregated material and energy flows with impacts and is not ideal for revealing the mechanisms or alternatives available to reduce systemic environmental risks. This study explores the value of integrating UM with LCA, using vehicle transportation in the Phoenix metropolitan area as an illustrative case study. Where other studies have focused on the use of LCA providing upstream supply-chain impacts for UM, we assert that the broader value of the integrated approach is in (1) the ability to cross scales (from micro to macro) in environmental assessment and (2) establishing an analysis that captures function and complexity in urban systems. The results for Phoenix show the complexity in resource supply chains and critical infrastructure services, how impacts accrue well beyond geopolitical boundaries where activities occur, and potential system vulnerabilities.","A Hybrid Approach for Assessing the Multi-Scale Impacts of Urban Resource Use: Transportation in Phoenix, Arizona",greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions *** industrial ecology *** life cycle assessment (LCA) *** multiscale analysis *** transportation *** urban metabolism,journal of industrial ecology,84971254545,2017,,,,,,
"© 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: In response to calls for conceptual frameworks and generic theory building toward the advancement of sustainability in supply chain resource utilization and management, the purpose of this paper is to advance a circular framework for supply chain resource sustainability (SCRS), and a decision-support methodology for assessing SCRS against the backdrop of five foundational premises (FPs) deduced from the literature on resource sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: Taking a conceptual theory-building approach, the paper advances a set of SCRS decision-support criteria for each of the theoretical premises advanced, and applies the theory of constraints to illustrate the conceptual and practical applications of the framework in SCRS decision making. Findings: This study uses recent conceptualizations of supply chains as “complex adaptive systems” to provide a robust and novel frame and a set of decision rules with which to assess the interconnectedness of environmental, economic, and social capital of supply chain resources from pre-production to post-production.

"© 2017 - IOS Press and the authors. Increasingly, scholars have been recognizing the importance of designing resilient supply chains (SCRES) within infrastructure networks. However, the existing literature discussed little on the non-linear behavior of the supply chain systems under chaos environment with disruptions. To fill the gaps, this paper aims to propose a more general formulation based on the coupled map lattices model for SCRES. The proposed model considers a multi-coupling and multi-level supply chain network. We use partial differential equations to form the coupled map lattices (CML) to model the behavior of non-linear network systems from perspectives of space and time dimension under different disruptions. Based on the simulation of two proposed indicators (Invulnerability and Restoration ability), we deduce four principles supporting to design SCRES; Finally, to further verify the feasibility of principles, we conduct a practical analysis as the comparison between our achievement and previous researches.",Non-linear behavior of supply chains under chaos environment with disruptions: Based on coupled map lattices,Coupled map lattices *** Networks *** Non-linear behavior *** Resilience *** Supply chains systems,intelligent decision technologies,85032830797,2017,,,,,,
"© 2016 The Authors Life cycle thinking is increasingly seen as a key concept for ensuring a transition towards more sustainable production and consumption patterns. As food production systems and consumption patterns are among the leading drivers of impacts on the environment, it is important to assess and improve food-related supply chains as much as possible. Over the years, life cycle assessment has been used extensively to assess agricultural systems and food processing and manufacturing activities, and compare alternatives “from field to fork” and through to food waste management. Notwithstanding the efforts, several methodological aspects of life cycle assessment still need further improvement in order to ensure adequate and robust support for decision making in both business and policy development contexts. This paper discusses the challenges for life cycle assessment arising from the complexity of food systems, and recommends research priorities for both scientific development and improvements in practical implementation. In summary, the intrinsic variability of food production systems requires dedicated modelling approaches, including addressing issues related to: the distinction between technosphere and ecosphere; the most appropriate functional unit; the multi-functionality of biological systems; and the modelling of the emissions and how this links with life cycle impact assessment. Also, data availability and interpretation of the results are two issues requiring further attention, including how to account for consumer behaviour.",The role of life cycle assessment in supporting sustainable agri-food systems: A review of the challenges,Agri-food products *** Food LCA *** Food supply chains *** Food waste *** Sustainable production and consumption,journal of cleaner production,84993952377,2017,,,,,,
"© 2017 Oftentimes, seemingly robust systems fail, almost inexplicably, due to unforeseen events leading to disruption. Exploration and research of the mechanisms behind the failure of such systems have revealed that those capable of surviving are not robust, but resilient. This has spawned a stream of research on the resilience of different complex systems, from ecosystems, to the human body, to supply chains and communication networks. Supply networks are complex adaptive systems in which a subset of agents create flow and are required to deliver such flow to sink agents located at the other end of the network. Delivery of flow under pre-defined service conditions requires resilient design and operation protocols. In this article, a supply network formalism is introduced, and the concept and dimensions of resilience in supply networks, explored. Five core components of resilience are derived from reviewed definitions; two resilience dimensions, structure and control protocols, and two resilience levels, agent and network level, are characterized based on insights from articles in literature. Finally, emerging trends in resilience research as well as current research gaps are presented and future work directions outlined.","Resilience in supply networks: Definition, dimensions, and levels",Collaborative Control Theory *** Complex adaptive systems *** Fault Tolerance by Teaming *** Sustainability,annual reviews in control,85015951330,2017,,,,,,
"© 2016 Elsevier Ltd Internationalization of markets and climate change introduce multifaceted challenges for modern supply chain (SC) management in the today's digitalisation era. On the other hand, Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) systems have reached an age of maturity that allows for their utilization towards tackling dynamic market conditions and aligning SC management focus with sustainability considerations. However, extant research only myopically tackles the sustainability potential of AGVs, focusing more on addressing network optimization problems and less on developing integrated and systematic methodological approaches for promoting economic, environmental and social sustainability. To that end, the present study provides a critical taxonomy of key decisions for facilitating the adoption of AGV systems into SC design and planning, as these are mapped on the relevant strategic, tactical and operational levels of the natural hierarchy. We then propose the Sustainable Supply Chain Cube (S2C2), a conceptual tool that integrates sustainable SC management with the proposed hierarchical decision-making framework for AGVs.

"© 2017 This study is aimed at developing the most important and applicable criteria and their corresponding sub-criteria for sustainable supplier selection through a questionnaire-based survey. In addition, a hybrid model is proposed to identify the most sustainable supplier with respect to the determined attributes using an Iranian textile manufacturing company as case study. The first contribution of the research is developing a comprehensive list of sustainability criteria and sub-criteria and incorporating them into a questionnaire and distributing the questionnaire to academics and practitioners for establishing the importance and applicability of these criteria and sub-criteria. In order to demonstrate the robustness of the data obtained from the questionnaire, different established statistical tests (Cronbach's alpha and Mann-Withney U-Test) were applied. The results show that economic aspect is still the most essential aspect, followed by environmental aspect and finally social aspect. The second contribution is the development of a new hybrid model by integrating fuzzy preference programing, as one of the newest and most accurate fuzzy modification of Analytical Hierarchy Process, with Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution. Fuzzy Preference Programming overcomes the shortcomings of the previous methods for obtaining the weight and Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution prioritizes the suppliers and finds the best one under uncertainty. Generally, the developed list provides a basis that is helpful in improving suppliers’ performance in terms of sustainability which leads to improvement in sustainable supply chain management performance. In addition, the developed hybrid model can deal with inconsistency, uncertainty and calculation complexity. Generally, the framework (including the first and second objectives) can be applied by managers to evaluate and determine their appropriate suppliers in the presence of uncertainty.",A decision support model for sustainable supplier selection in sustainable supply chain management,Fuzzy preference programming *** Importance and applicability *** Questionnaire-based survey *** Sustainable supplier selection,computers and industrial engineering,85011290398,2017,,,,,,
"© 2016 IEEE. Under the trend of globalization, rapid advancement of Information Technology, shorter electronic product life cycles, and the rise of consumer consciousness, there is fiercer market competition in most industries, especially in the semiconductor industry. Effective supply chain management is a critical successful factor for enterprises to survive in such a competitive market since it can help enterprises in reducing cost and improving operational efficiency. For an integrated device manufacturer (IDM) in the semiconductor industry, due to its complex network, strategic alliance among partners as well as supply chain integration are efficient approaches to enhance competitiveness and make more profit. In this paper, we develop an integrated model of supply chain planning for IDMs. The integrated model is developed to help decision makers determine the production quantities and delivery quantities at various locations, the decoupling point of a push-pull supply chain, the inventory buffer at the boundary and the vendor managed inventory scenario. The semiconductor manufacturing characteristics including binning, substitution, and yield are taken into consideration in the formulated model.

Nowadays, more and more enterprises are aware and motivated to adhere to collaborative platforms as business enablers, allowing groups of companies to improve their offer and competitiveness. As such, the concept of business ecosystem is becoming prominent. However, despite the evidences of collaboration benefits, for which some research efforts have been made, there is still a lack of suitable performance indicators and associated metrics to assess those benefits, promoting sustainability and resilience of the members of a collaborative business ecosystem. The analysis of the literature shows that a number of contributions can be found in several research fields, such as enterprise performance indicators, collaboration benefits, value systems, supply chain collaboration, and social network analysis. The purpose of this paper is to survey these areas, highlighting their potential contributions concerning the assessment of collaborative benefits and performance.

"© 2016 Elsevier Ltd Climate change and greenhouse gases emissions have caused countries to implement various carbon regulatory mechanisms in some industrial sectors around the globe to curb carbon emissions. One effective method to reduce industry environmental footprint is the use of a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). The decision concerning the design and planning of an optimal network of the CLSC plays a vital role in determining the total carbon footprint across the supply chain and also the total cost. In this context, this research proposes an optimization model for design and planning a multi-period, multi-product CLSC with carbon footprint consideration under two different uncertainties. The demand and returns uncertainties are considered by means of multiple scenarios and uncertainty of carbon emissions due to supply chain related activities are considered by means of bounded box set and solve using robust optimization approach. The model extends further to investigate the impact of different carbon policies such as including strict carbon cap, carbon tax, carbon cap-and-trade, and carbon offset on the supply chain strategic and operational decisions. The model captures trade-offs that exist among supply chain total cost and carbon emissions. Also, the proposed model optimizes both supply chain total cost and carbon emissions across the supply chain activities. The numerical results reveal some insightful observations with respect to CLSC strategic design decisions and carbon emissions under various carbon policies and at the end we highlighted some managerial insights.",Multi-period planning of closed-loop supply chain with carbon policies under uncertainty,Carbon emission *** Carbon policies *** Closed-loop supply chain network design *** Mathematical modelling *** Robust optimization *** Stochastic programming *** Transportation mode selection,transportation research part d: transport and environment,85009874268,2017,,,,,,
"© 2017 by the authors. The establishment of an efficient reverse supply chain is important, especially in the electronics industry, considering the environmental and resource pressures worldwide. Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), an important environmental policy approach, has been adopted extensively in various countries, and the effectiveness of its implementation has been proven through practical application. However, the establishment and development of EPR are lacking in most developing countries where collection and recycling systems are underdeveloped. This study addresses this problem by exploring the hierarchical relationship among the driving factors of EPR in the electronics industry in China and by identifying and ranking the factors that are critical in EPR implementation. As important managerial conclusions, research results show that EPR-related laws and regulations, the consciousness of senior executives, and corporate image are the three most important driving factors of EPR implementation.",Analysis of driving factors for Extended Producer Responsibility by using interpretative structure modelling (ISM) and analytic network process (ANP),Analytic Network Process *** Driving factors *** Extended Producer Responsibility *** Interpretative Structure Modelling,sustainability (switzerland),85017334824,2017,,,,,,
"© 2017, The Author(s). This paper outlines the development of an integrated interdisciplinary approach to agri-food research, designed to address the ‘grand challenge’ of global food security. Rather than meeting this challenge by working in separate domains or via single-disciplinary perspectives, we chart the development of a system-wide approach to the food supply chain. In this approach, social and environmental questions are simultaneously addressed. Firstly, we provide a holistic model of the agri-food system, which depicts the processes involved, the principal inputs and outputs, the actors and the external influences, emphasising the system’s interactions, feedbacks and complexities. Secondly, we show how this model necessitates a research programme that includes the study of land-use, crop production and protection, food processing, storage and distribution, retailing and consumption, nutrition and public health. Acknowledging the methodological and epistemological challenges involved in developing this approach, we propose two specific ways forward. Firstly, we propose a method for analysing and modelling agri-food systems in their totality, which enables the complexity to be reduced to essential components of the whole system to allow tractable quantitative analysis using LCA and related methods. This initial analysis allows for more detailed quantification of total system resource efficiency, environmental impact and waste. Secondly, we propose a method to analyse the ethical, legal and political tensions that characterise such systems via the use of deliberative fora. We conclude by proposing an agenda for agri-food research which combines these two approaches into a rational programme for identifying, testing and implementing the new agri-technologies and agri-food policies, advocating the critical application of nexus thinking to meet the global food security challenge.",An agenda for integrated system-wide interdisciplinary agri-food research,Agri-food research *** Consumer practice *** Crop production *** Food justice *** Food production *** Food sales *** Food security *** Land use *** Life cycle assessment *** Nutrition *** Public health *** Resource management,food security,85013131129,2017,,,,,,
"© 2016, © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  &  Francis Group. Rice supply chain in Bangladesh is a focus for considerations of food security and climate change impacts. Although Bangladesh is self-sufficient in rice, supply chain management lacks efficiency and results in artificial crisis and price volatility. This paper presents a system dynamics model of supply chain of rice starting from the farmers to the consumers to address supply chain management scenarios and design the policy options for efficient and sustainable supply chain management of rice in Bangladesh to ensure the availability of rice to the consumers in an economic manner under uncertainty. Towards these ends, the impacts of productivity changes of the seasonal production of rice, lead time and demand average variability on the supply chain performances are assessed and different management policies are analysed. Initially drying the rice and round the year operation of the milling industries stabilises not only the milling inventory but also the whole system. Also less total supply chain cost from economic operation results in less fuel consumption and hence less contribution to global warming. The model has the potential to identify and study the critical components of the overall supply chain, allowing for the creation of an efficient and sustainable supply chain network.",Modelling of supply chain of rice in Bangladesh,Bangladesh *** economic order quantity *** lead time *** Modelling *** reordering point *** rice *** supply chain *** system dynamics,international journal of systems science: operations and logistics,85056884744,2017,,,,,,
"© 2017 Elsevier Ltd Food supply chains (FSCs) over recent years have been epitomised by a range of concerns such as food and nutrition security, the distribution of value and a growing awareness of the threats posed by climate change. Taken together, these pressures have created a sense of urgency to re-examine the performance, equitability and sustainability of FSCs. This paper argues for the need to acknowledge and access the multiple, contested meanings that are attributed to FSCs. Taking its lead from post-normal science, the approach developed aims to understand the different contexts and account for the ‘multiple realities’ that exist. Key to this has been the development of a range of attributes of FSC performance that are common across narratives of sustainability and yet framed in various ways by different categories of actors, examined across a range of national contexts and within four spheres of influence. In so doing, this approach has the potential to more widely legitimise knowledge claims regarding FSC performance. This is critical if producers, policy-makers and consumers are to have the cognitive tools to enable them to make informed decisions about the broader impacts of the different FSCs they engage with.",Acknowledging complexity in food supply chains when assessing their performance and sustainability,Attributes *** Food supply chains *** Multi-dimensional perspectives *** Performance *** Spheres *** Sustainability assessment,journal of rural studies,85016041505,2017,,,,,,
"© 2017 Elsevier Ltd The main objective of this research is to introduce the concept of Green Opportunistic Supply Chain (GrOSC) and to design it in a lean and agile manufacturing setting under uncertain and risky environment. The model considers the uncertainties of the market-related information, i.e. the demand and transportation and shortage costs, under Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) strategy. Addressing the retailer's risk aversion level through Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) to deal with these uncertainties leads to a bi-level programming problem. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are adopted to transform the model into a single-level mixed integer linear programming problem. Since, the realization of the uncertain parameters is the only information available, a data-driven approach is employed to avoid distributional assumptions. The effectiveness of the model is finally demonstrated through a numerical example.",Robust bi-level optimization for green opportunistic supply chain network design problem against uncertainty and environmental risk,Bi-level programming *** Conditional value at risk *** Green supply chain *** KKT-conditions *** Robust optimization,computers and industrial engineering,85016559184,2017,,,,,,
"Copyright © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd. Nowadays, supply chains play an inevitable role in prompt handling of varying customer's needs. Furthermore, with increasing emphasis on vulnerabilities in supply chains, effective mathematical tools for analysing and understanding appropriate supply chain risk evaluation are now attracting more attention. Administration of a successful supply chain depends on how efficiently of the network design is measured and how source risks effect it. This research has two objectives. The first one is to design a multi agent supply chain network that addresses an uncertain environment threatened by different risk sources in order to capture the real world conditions; the second one is to present a methodology for estimating risk in the proposed network. Moreover tree of scenarios are constructed and risk assessment model considering domino effect is built in order to carry out the overall quantitative risk assessment. Then, probability theories are applied in the quantitative method.

"© 2016, The Author(s). Seaweed supply chains in Indonesia, especially carrageenan and agar products, are subject to risks arising both inside the participating companies and in their external networks. Uncertainties in yield, quality, price, and infrastructure in one part of the supply chain can affect the whole chain. To ensure a sustainable seaweed industry, an appropriate supply chain risk management (SCRM) is needed. There are four critical steps in SCRM: identifying seaweed supply chains, identifying and categorizing risks, assessing risks, and mitigating risks. To identify seaweed supply chains, we conducted field research, in-depth interviews, and literature studies. The field survey was conducted in the Provinces of South Sulawesi, West Java, East Java, Banten, and West Nusa Tenggara. The seaweed supply chains were modeled by the software Umberto to get a better understanding of material and energy flows between the key members. To identify and categorize the risks, we started with the risks mentioned in the existing literature works, and then applied the Delphi method to analyze the potential risk sources, their causes, and their impacts. To assess risks, we used a semiquantitative approach through the face-to-face interviews to generate a risk map showing the likelihood, and impact of adverse events. Afterward, the risk intensity was categorized based on the value of the responses and classified into five categories: negligible, marginal, critical, most critical, and catastrophic risks. The mitigation strategies considered sustainability (environment, economy, and social) and risks criteria. Multi-criteria decision analysis was used to evaluate these strategies.",Managing risks in the Indonesian seaweed supply chain,Marine biomass resources *** MCDA *** Mitigation strategies *** Seaweed supply chain risks *** Supply chain risk management,clean technologies and environmental policy,84983751848,2017,,,,,,
"© 2017 Sharif University of Technology. All rights reserved. This paper proposes a new multi-objective, multi-echelon supply chain network design problem. The proposed framework is green, in which it tackles the demand uncertainty of a product, environmental uncertainties, and the downstream risk attitude into the problem formulation. In this way, the demand uncertainty is taken into account through the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) method which, in turn, relies on the datadriven approach. On the other hand, uncertainty set approach is employed to deal with the environmental uncertainties, i.e. CO2 emissions. Proposition of such a green supply chain network, based on the aforementioned uncertainties, makes the proposed model realistic, which is what completely missing in the literature. In order to proceed with this model, a robust counterpart of the developed uncertain problem should be formulated. The augmented ϵ-constraint method is used to transform the developed multi-objective mathematical programming problem into a single-objective one. This may give rise to the global optimal solution through the exact mathematical solution method. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework.","A multi-objective, multi-echelon green supply chain network design problem with risk-averse retailers in an uncertain environment",Conditional Value at Risk *** Green supply chain network design *** Risk averseness *** Uncertainty,scientia iranica,85027855723,2017,,,,,,
"© 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: Climate vulnerability assessments are often operationalized by the analysis of indicators defined by the spatial boundaries of the community under study. These, however, sometimes fail to capture interdependency among communities for basic resources. This paper aims to propose a framework for characterizing vulnerability caused by interdependency by adapting a supply chain lens. Design/methodology/approach: The paper proposes a definition for “indirect vulnerability” that recognizes the transboundary and teleconnected nature of vulnerability arising from resource networks among cities and communities. A conceptual framework using a supply chain approach is presented for climate hazards in particular. This approach is then demonstrated through a rapid appraisal of the rice, energy and water supply chains and the waste management chains of Metro Manila. Findings: The application of the supply chain lens to assessing the indirect vulnerability of Metro Manila brings to fore issues extending beyond the decision-making boundaries of local government units. Addressing these will require vertical government coordination and horizontal inter-sectoral collaboration. Thus, this supply chain-based indirect vulnerability assessment can be complementary to traditional vulnerability assessments in providing a larger systems perspective. Originality/value: Innovative tools are needed to make community vulnerability assessments both holistic and tractable. Existing methods in the private sector can be adapted rather than reinventing the wheel. This supply chain framework can be a useful decision support and planning tool across governance levels to comprehensively address vulnerability.",A supply chain framework for characterizing indirect vulnerability,Climate *** Hazards *** Supply chain *** Sustainable cities *** Vulnerability,international journal of climate change strategies and management,85015750234,2017,,,,,,
"There is increasing interest in how horizontal collaboration between parcel carriers might help alleviate problems associated with last-mile logistics in congested urban centers. Through a detailed review of the literature on parcel logistics pertaining to collaboration, along with practical insights from carriers operating in the United Kingdom, this paper examines the challenges that will be faced in optimizing multicarrier, multidrop collection, and delivery schedules. A freight traffic controller (FTC) concept is proposed. The FTC would be a trusted third party, assigned to equitably manage the work allocation between collaborating carriers and the passage of vehicles over the last mile when joint benefits to the parties could be achieved. Creating this FTC concept required a combinatorial optimization approach for evaluation of the many combinations of hub locations, network configuration, and routing options for vehicle or walking to find the true value of each potential collaboration. At the same time, the traffic, social, and environmental impacts of these activities had to be considered. Cooperative game theory is a way to investigate the formation of collaborations (or coalitions), and the analysis used in this study identified a significant shortfall in current applications of this theory to last-mile parcel logistics. Application of theory to urban freight logistics has, thus far, failed to account for critical concerns including (a) the mismatch of vehicle parking locations relative to actual delivery addresses; (b) the combination of deliveries with collections, requests for the latter often being received in real time during the round; and (c) the variability in travel times and route options attributable to traffic and road network conditions.",Enabling a Freight Traffic Controller for Collaborative Multidrop Urban Logistics Practical and Theoretical Challenges, ,transportation research record,WOS:000413458100007,2017,,,,,,
"© 2017 Biofuels from biomass gasification are reviewed here, and demonstrated to be an attractive option. Recent progress in gasification techniques and key generation pathways for biofuels production, process design and integration and socio-environmental impacts of biofuel generation are discussed, with the goal of investigating gasification-to-biofuels’ credentials as a sustainable and eco-friendly technology. The synthesis of important biofuels such as bio-methanol, bio-ethanol and higher alcohols, bio-dimethyl ether, Fischer Tropsch fuels, bio-methane, bio-hydrogen and algae-based fuels is reviewed, together with recent technologies, catalysts and reactors. Significant thermodynamic studies for each biofuel are also examined. Syngas cleaning is demonstrated to be a critical issue for biofuel production, and innovative pathways such as those employed by Choren Industrietechnik, Germany, and BioMCN, the Netherlands, are shown to allow efficient methanol generation. The conversion of syngas to FT transportation fuels such as gasoline and diesel over Co or Fe catalysts is reviewed and demonstrated to be a promising option for the future of biofuels. Bio-methane has emerged as a lucrative alternative for conventional transportation fuel with all the advantages of natural gas including a dense distribution, trade and supply network. Routes to produce H2 are discussed, though critical issues such as storage, expensive production routes with low efficiencies remain. Algae-based fuels are in the research and development stage, but are shown to have immense potential to become commercially important because of their capability to fix large amounts of CO2, to rapidly grow in many environments and versatile end uses. However, suitable process configurations resulting in optimal plant designs are crucial, so detailed process integration is a powerful tool to optimize current and develop new processes. LCA and ethical issues are also discussed in brief. It is clear that the use of food crops, as opposed to food wastes represents an area fraught with challenges, which must be resolved on a case by case basis.",Progress in biofuel production from gasification,Biofuels *** Biomass *** Gasification *** Process design *** Thermodynamics,progress in energy and combustion science,85018774862,2017,,,,,,
"© 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: A case is made for developing “Relationally Integrated Value Networks for Total Facilities Management” (RIVANS-TFM) by synergistically connecting significant stakeholders of the project management (PM) and facilities management (FM) phases to deliver substantially better value for the end users of built infrastructure. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: A structured questionnaire survey enabled identification of typically significant stakeholders in the PM and FM phases. In total, 14 key stakeholders were identified through t-test analysis in this Sri Lankan study. Semi-structured interviews unveiled relationships among the aforementioned stakeholders and the findings were used to develop the “required” RIVANS-TFM, as well as the “existing” RIVANS-TFM, using the UCINET social network analysis software package. Social network theory of relationships was applied to analyze the networks in terms of “Structural Holes” or missing links and “Brokerage Potentials.” Findings: Structural holes analysis highlighted the existing setup to be more vulnerable to missing links than the “required”/targeted setup. Furthermore, brokerage potentials analysis revealed that owners, project managers, facility managers, maintenance engineers, main contractors, designers, principal consultants, and other specialist consultants can act as “brokers” to bridge the gaps or minimize structural holes, thereby uplifting and reinforcing the existing network to deliver better performance and value in TFM. Originality/value: By revealing existing and required levels of integration of each stakeholder in RIVANS-TFM, clients are provided a great opportunity to identify the stakeholders who should be engaged more, or less – in order to best achieve clients’ long-term aspirations and project objectives. Furthermore, the findings also indicate appropriate levels of stakeholder relationships to target, in order to maintain efficient flows of information, material and services in the supply chains while enhancing TFM life-cycle values.",Relationally integrated value networks (RIVANS) for total facilities management (TFM),Construction industry *** Life-cycle value *** Project management *** Relationally integrated value networks (RIVANS) *** Social network *** Total facilities management (TFM),built environment project and asset management,85023642065,2017,,,,,,
"Designing of storage facilities is an interdisciplinary process that requires consideration of technical, economic, social or environmental issues. Storage facilities, as a part of supply chain are designed to provide customers availability of goods at a certain time, quantity and place. This involves the functions resulting therefrom, such as storage, sorting, picking, packing, etc. The efficiency of processes in the supply chains is strongly influenced by the location and shape of the storage facilities that are critical components. These issues are multi-threaded, and they are subject of an iterative approach in which information tools are playing a special role. One of such tool is the SIMMAG3D system. It is a system for modelling and visualization in 3D of warehouse facilities, which was built based on developed mathematical models, computational algorithms and functional dependencies necessary for the designing of storage facilities. It also takes into account the different types of warehouses and design methodologies as well as the location of warehouses in the logistic network. The article presents the elements of the SIMMAG3D system and characterizes its functional capabilities. It has been pointed out that one of the key elements of the system is the module for 3D visualization of storage facilities. It has been described in detail.

"© 2016 Elsevier Ltd As major generators of environmental impacts, farms play a crucial role in enhancing the environmental sustainability of food-supply chains. However, appropriately assessing farm environmental performance poses a challenge; a plethora of different indicators have been used for this purpose, sometimes in the absence of conceptual considerations. This paper develops a broadly implementable framework for defining and measuring farm environmental performance which complies with the environmental sustainability concept viewed from an ecological perspective. After providing a critical review of existing indicators in the literature for measuring farm environmental performance and identifying their strengths and above all their weaknesses, it proceeds to develop ideas on how to implement the environmental sustainability concept at farm level. Starting at the macro level, these ideas are based on the central concept of ecosystem carrying capacity (constraints) referring to biophysical threshold thinking. The implementation of this concept at farm level results in the framework that we propose for measuring farm environmental performance. Environmental sustainability requires compliance with the carrying-capacity constraints imposed by the natural ecosystem within which a farm operates. Compliance with carrying capacity must occur at both local and global ecosystem levels, requiring a distinction between local and global farm environmental performance. The global environmental performance of a farm is defined as its relative contribution to compliance with the carrying capacity of the global ecosystem, and is measured by means of an indicator of environmental intensity over the entire production chain up to the farm gate. The local carrying-capacity constraint can be understood as the maximum environmental impact per unit of farmland area that can be sustained by the local ecosystem. Local environmental performance is therefore measured by means of an area-based indicator. Whereas all environmental issues must be considered at a global level, for some of them local level consideration is also required. Implementing separate local and global environmental performance indicators, as opposed to using only global or local indicators without distinguishing between them in conceptual terms, provides a more appropriate assessment of the environmental performance of farms, as well as a better basis for comparison between farms. Furthermore, it eliminates the risk of shifting environmental problems from the local to the global scale or vice-versa. The framework highlights the complexity of the environmental sustainability concept, which cannot be reduced to a single “one size fits all” indicator.",Implementing farm-level environmental sustainability in environmental performance indicators: A combined global-local approach,Agriculture *** Carrying capacity *** Environmental sustainability *** Farm environmental performance *** Life cycle assessment (LCA),journal of cleaner production,84994008622,2017,,,,,,

Purpose -The purpose of this paper is to explore key factors or criteria of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) influencing Indonesian coal companies, using ""adoption, implementation, and performance"" (A-I-P) of SSCM, thru three means: first, to investigate which criteria have higher weight to achieve SSCM in Indonesia; second, to see whether there are any differences between the Indonesia case and existing literature of SSCM; third, to highlight any causal relationships between the Indonesia case and the SSCM theory. Design/methodology/approach - DEMATEL-based analytic network process (DANP) questionnaire survey with a theoretical SSCM model is applied to conduct an empirical test for the coal production and supply chain companies in Indonesia. Findings -The ""performance"" dimension out of the A-I-P of the SSCM is the most important one, while the ""adoption"" dimension is the least. Out of the 12 criteria under the three dimensions, the ""operational, economic, environmental, and social"" factors under the category of the performance dimension and the ""ISO 14001 certification"" criteria belonging to the dimension of ""implementation"" are the top five key factors in the SSCM. Research limitations/implications -There are some limitations in this study. First and foremost is the relatively small sample size with a limited geographic area, although they are unavoidable owing to one country case study. Practical implications -The test results are helpful to draw guidance for sustainable supply chain managers in implementing efficient SSCM in the wave of tough competition and changing marketplace. Originality/value -This study contributes first to developing a theoretical framework for SSCM under the A-I-P model and second, to applying DANP to an empirical case of SSCM of the coal industry in Indonesia. As a result, the authors draw helpful guidelines and policy implications for SSCM of the coal industry, referring to the A-I-P dimension as drivers and enablers for the SSCM performances of the industry.",Key factors for truly sustainable supply chain management: An investigation of the coal industry in Indonesia,Analytic network process (ANP) *** Asia *** Critical success factors *** DEMATEL *** Sustainable supply chain management,international journal of logistics management,85032678970,2017,,,,,,

"© 2017 WIT Press Situational awareness of the operational status of specific, critical supply and demand nodes following a major disaster may inform response and recovery activities based on the ability of an infrastructure asset or system to support core facility operations. Near-real-time analysis of infrastructure dependency information is a computationally intensive process that has generally been observed informally by public safety officials. While system-level information may be desired, it has been beyond the capabilities of most local public safety and emergency management agencies. To address this problem, a Grassroots Infrastructure Dependency Model (GRID-M) was developed to enable near-real-time analysis of physical infrastructure dependencies of specific supply and demand nodes within four lifeline sectors: electricity, natural gas, water, and wastewater. The operational status of each node can be characterized as operational, partially operational, or not operational. These statuses are obtained by matching real-time outage or disruption data from utility providers with predetermined specific coping strategies based on a preincident limited infrastructure survey for specific assets within a network. This information can also be paired with a limited damage assessment to provide awareness of the accessibility to, and physical state of, each node within supply chains of interest. GRID-M displays all outputs within a Geographic Information Systems environment with additional prepopulated layers such as real-time traffic and demographic information of the affected communities. As such, GRID-M may be used following a major disaster to support the identification of priority response and recovery objectives based on the disruptions of critical local supply chains and their relationship with affected communities.",Local supply chains: The disaster management perspective,Critical infrastructure *** Dependency *** Disaster *** Emergency management *** Preparedness *** Resilience *** Supply chain,international journal of safety and security engineering,85053485307,2017,,,,,,
"© 2016 Elsevier Ltd This paper shows a multi-objectives mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model for a petrochemical supply chain under uncertainty environments, namely disruption risks and less knowledge of parameters. In this model, two efficient queuing systems are applied in nylon plastic manufacturing and recycling centers, in which a Jackson network is also used. The aims are to minimize the average tardiness to deliver products, total cost and transportation cost. In addition the developed model specifies the optimal locations for a new distribution center (DC), collection center and disposal center as well as the optimal allocation of customer zones to each DC.

"© 2017 The Authors Solar cells are considered as one of the prominent sources of renewable energy suitable for large-scale adoption in a carbon-constrained world and can contribute to reduced reliance on energy imports, whilst improving the security of energy supply. A new arrival in the family of solar cells technologies is the organic-inorganic halide perovskite. The major thrust for endorsing these new solar cells pertains to their potential as an economically and environmentally viable option to traditional silicon-based technology. To verify this assertion, this paper presents a critical review of some existing photovoltaic (PV) technologies in comparison with perovskite-structured solar cells (PSCs), including material and performance parameters, production processes and manufacturing complexity, economics, key technological challenges for further developments and current research efforts. At present, there is limited environmental assessment of PSCs and consequently, a methodologically robust and environmentally expansive lifecycle supply chain assessment of two types of PSC modules A and B is also undertaken within the context of other PV technologies, to assess their potential for environmentally friendly innovation in the energy sector. Module A is based on MAPbX3 perovskite structure while module B is based on CsFAPbX3 with improved stability, reproducibility and high performance efficiency. The main outcomes, presented along with sensitivity analysis, show that PSCs offer more environmentally friendly and sustainable option, with the least energy payback period, as compared to other PV technologies. The review and analysis presented provide valuable insight and guidance in identifying pathways and windows of opportunity for future PV designs towards cleaner and sustainable energy production.",Perovskite solar cells: An integrated hybrid lifecycle assessment and review in comparison with other photovoltaic technologies,Climate change *** Environmental analysis *** Lifecycle assessment *** Perovskite solar cells *** Photovoltaic technologies *** Supply chain modelling *** Sustainability metrics,renewable and sustainable energy reviews,85020420725,2017,,,,,,
"© 2016 Elsevier B.V. Product recovery has become a viable option for many industries to realize economic gains while protecting the environment. However, insufficient investment and inefficient supply chains have hampered the viability of reuse and/or recycling because of the extended time intervals between the recycling process of recovery and reuse. Manufacturers and distributors face the challenge and necessity to reduce these process delays in order to recover the maximum value of the returned products through an effective, responsive closed loop supply chain (CLSC). This paper quantitatively measures the effective responsiveness of the CLSC model in terms of time and energy efficiency. The proposed multi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MOMILP) model evaluates delay parameters with decision variables that maximize profit, optimize customer surplus and minimize energy use. The model suggests decision makers may achieve an optimal tradeoff among differing objectives in a multiple-objective CLSC scenario. We employed a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) approach to solve the proposed MOMILP model and compared our approach with the Non-Dominated Sorted Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) for optimal solution. Results of the comparative evolutionary approaches shows that MOPSO outperforms NSGA-II in almost all cases in achieving the best trade-off solutions. Sensitivity analysis carried out to test the robustness of the model confirms that substantially less cost is feasible through the reduction of return process delays. This paper aims to formulate a multi-objective CLSC problem based on a network-flow model measuring the time value to recover maximum assets lost due to delay at different stages of the recycle process. We also developed a particle swarm approach for a multi-objective CLSC. Our study also offers valuable insights for designers wishing to create a product flow network with an optimal capacity level in case of prioritized objectives scenarios.",Closed loop supply chain networks: Designs for energy and time value efficiency,Closed loop supply chain *** Multi-objective particle swarm optimization *** Product recovery *** Time-sensitive product returns,international journal of production economics,84973131343,2017,,,,,,
"© 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: Billions of entrepreneurs at the Base of the Pyramid (BoP) operate as small-scale producers within multi-tiered supply chain networks. Unfortunately, a majority of these entrepreneurs are simply unable to derive sufficient value from the network and are vulnerable to disasters and poverty. The purpose of this paper is to develop a typology that examines dynamic and triadic power relationships in order to create value chains for BoP producers. Design/methodology/approach: This paper builds upon the available literature and a relevant historical case study to develop a typology. The validity of the typology is ascertained by examining and comparing two current BoP silk weaver communities in India. Findings: The typology captures essential environmental variables and relates them to mediated and non-mediated forms of power which, in turn, shape the value derived from the supply chain network. Practical implications: The typology provides specific recommendations for BoP producers, such as the formation of cooperatives, engaging in political unionization and ensuring that their social networks expand beyond local communities. Originality/value: The typology brings together structuration theory and power and provides a framework for understanding supply value. This typology is generalizable to dynamic multi-tiered supply chain networks.",Value supply chains at the base of the pyramid: studies of past and present textile networks,Poverty alleviation *** Power *** Supply chain integration,journal of humanitarian logistics and supply chain management,85036636463,2017,,,,,,
"© 2017 Elsevier Ltd Recent works on organizational adaptation to climate change have repeatedly stressed that – despite concerns about large-scale impacts of climate change on supply chain networks – studies on climate change adaptation in manufacturing industries are still surprisingly scarce. The following study develops a systemic analytical framework based on which climate risks for manufacturing industries are reviewed and drivers (defined as supportive factors) of entrepreneurial robustness are examined. The analysis builds upon a case study in the alpine Austrian state of Tyrol where an intense regional rise of average temperatures occurs, going along with increased risks of natural mountain hazards and exposed settlement structures. In this climate-sensitive setting the authors conducted a survey on risk perceptions among 102 managers from manufacturing firms. Based on a comparison of the sectors metal and engineering, timber products, and construction, the authors argue that drivers of entrepreneurial robustness can be subsumed under five major strategic principles: (a) the deployment of slack resources, (b) vertical supply chain integration, (c) manufacturing flexibility, (d) material efficiency, and (e) technological risk prevention. Departing from the empirical results, the authors argue that across these principles the development of drivers depends on an interplay of structural prerequisites and human decisions on the levels of the focal firm, the supply chain network, and the political, economic, and geographic environment. In this sense, the authors conceptualize different forms of contingencies – thus effects influencing the development of drivers – within an ontology which may support further system-oriented analysis of climate change adaptation in industry.",A multi-level perspective on climate risks and drivers of entrepreneurial robustness – Findings from sectoral comparison in alpine Austria,Climate change adaptation *** Manufacturing industries *** Risk perceptions *** Sectoral comparison *** Supply chain risks *** Vulnerability,global environmental change,85016500617,2017,,,,,,

Green and sustainable drug manufacturing go hand in hand with forward-looking visions seeking to balance the long-term sustainability of business, society, and the environment. However, a lack of harmonization among available metrics has inhibited opportunities for green chemistry in industry. Moreover, inconsistent starting points for analysis and neglected complexities for diverse manufacturing processes have made developing objective goals a challenge. Herein we put forward a practical strategy to overcome these barriers using data from in-depth analysis of 46 drug manufacturing processes from nine large pharmaceutical firms, and propose the Green Aspiration Level as metric of choice to enable the critically needed consistency in smart green manufacturing goals. In addition, we quantify the importance of green chemistry in the often overlooked, yet enormously impactful, outsourced portion of the supply chain, and introduce the Green Scorecard as a value added sustainability communication tool.",A deeper shade of green: Inspiring sustainable drug manufacturing, ,green chemistry,85018769458,2017,,,,,,
"© 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  &  Francis Group. There is an ongoing paradigm shift in manufacturing, in which the modern manufacturing industry is changing towards global manufacturing networks and supply chains. This will lead to the flexible usage of different globally distributed, scalable and sustainable, service-oriented manufacturing systems and resources. Combining recently emerged technologies, such as Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Semantic Web, service-oriented technologies, virtualisation and advanced high-performance computing technologies, with advanced manufacturing models and information technologies, Cloud Manufacturing is a new manufacturing paradigm built on resource sharing, supporting and driving this change. It is envisioned that companies in all sectors of manufacturing will be able to package their resources and know-hows in the Cloud, making them conveniently available for others through pay-as-you-go, which is also timely and economically attractive. Resources, e.g. manufacturing software tools, applications, knowledge and fabrication capabilities and equipment, will then be made accessible to presumptive consumers on a worldwide basis. Cloud Manufacturing has been in focus for a great deal of research interest and suggested applications during recent years, by both industrial and academic communities. After surveying a vast array of available publications, this paper presents an up-to-date literature review together with identified outstanding research issues, and future trends and directions within Cloud Manufacturing.",Cloud manufacturing–a critical review of recent development and future trends,cloud manufacturing *** resource sharing *** service-orientation,international journal of computer integrated manufacturing,84927720769,2017,,,,,,
"© 2017 by the authors. Traditional (technical) concepts to ensure a reliable water supply, a safe handling of wastewater and flood protection are increasingly criticised as outdated and unsustainable. These so-called centralised urban water systems are further maladapted to upcoming challenges because of their long lifespan in combination with their short-sighted planning and design. A combination of (existing) centralised and decentralised infrastructure is expected to be more reliable and sustainable. However, the impact of increasing implementation of decentralised technologies on the local technical performance in sewer or water supply networks and the interaction with the urban form has rarely been addressed in the literature. In this work, an approach which couples the UrbanBEATS model for the planning of decentralised strategies together with a water supply modelling approach is developed and applied to a demonstration case. With this novel approach, critical but also favourable areas for such implementations can be identified. For example, low density areas, which have high potential for rainwater harvesting, can result in local water quality problems in the supply network when further reducing usually low pipe velocities in these areas. On the contrary, in high demand areas (e.g., high density urban forms) there is less effect of rainwater harvesting due to the limited available space. In these high density areas, water efficiency measures result in the highest savings in water volume, but do not cause significant problems in the technical performance of the potable water supply network. For a more generalised and case-independent conclusion, further analyses are performed for semi-virtual benchmark networks to answer the question of an appropriate representation of the water distribution system in a computational model for such an analysis. Inappropriate hydraulic model assumptions and characteristics were identified for the stated problem, which have more impact on the assessments than the decentralised measures.",Impact of hybridwater supply on the centralised water system,Integrated system analysis *** Rain water harvesting *** Urban form *** UrbanBEATS *** Water quality analysis,water (switzerland),85033605385,2017,,,,,,
"© 2017 Elsevier Ltd This paper proposes a hybrid goal programming-data envelopment analysis (GP-DEA) model in a network structure to present improvement solutions and rank units of a supply chain. The improvement solutions are presented for all efficient and inefficient units based on experts’ requirements. Therefore, the goals are considered as fuzzy values. To deal with uncertainty, a suitable fuzzy possibilistic approach is employed. Given robust optimization approach, the units of the supply chain are ranked based on penalties of deviations from goals as feasibility robustness and also the average and standard deviation of deviations as optimality robustness. One advantage of the proposed model is that it can determine balancing values and improvement solutions for flows among the units of a supply chain which have dual-roles factors so that the deviations from their goals are minimized. The proposed robust network GP-DEA model is run in a case study. The outcome of this paper can be used to evaluate and rank all types of supply chains with different network structures.",A robust fuzzy possibilistic programming for a new network GP-DEA model to evaluate sustainable supply chains,Data envelopment analysis (DEA) *** Goal programming (GP) *** Network data envelopment analysis (NDEA) *** Robust possibilistic programming *** Sustainable supply chain,journal of cleaner production,85029158486,2017,,,,,,
"© 2017 The Authors Supply chain network design (SCND) is one of the most crucial planning problems in supply chain management (SCM). Nowadays, design decisions should be viable enough to function well under complex and uncertain business environments for many years or decades. Therefore, it is essential to make these decisions in the presence of uncertainty, as over the last two decades, a large number of relevant publications have emphasized its importance. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of studies in the fields of SCND and reverse logistics network design under uncertainty. The paper is organized in two main parts to investigate the basic features of these studies. In the first part, planning decisions, network structure, paradigms and aspects related to SCM are discussed. In the second part, existing optimization techniques for dealing with uncertainty such as recourse-based stochastic programming, risk-averse stochastic programming, robust optimization, and fuzzy mathematical programming are explored in terms of mathematical modeling and solution approaches. Finally, the drawbacks and missing aspects of the related literature are highlighted and a list of potential issues for future research directions is recommended.",Supply chain network design under uncertainty: A comprehensive review and future research directions,Risk consideration *** Robust optimization *** Stochastic programming *** Supply chain management *** Supply chain network design *** Uncertainty,european journal of operational research,85020189152,2017,,,,,,
"© 2017 The global disaggregation of food supply chains and just-in-time business models with low inventories mean that governments, traders, producers and consumers are increasingly exposed to unforeseen interruptions to supply and associated volatility in food prices. While considerable research has examined the risk of disturbance in global energy markets resulting from a disruption to physical chokepoints along major trade routes, no comparable analysis has been undertaken for agricultural commodities. Here we present the Chatham House Maritime Analysis Tool (CH-MAT), which estimates the volume and value of staple foods passing through maritime chokepoints. The CH-MAT permits analysis of flows through chokepoints arising from bilateral trade in commodities over the period 2000 to 2015. The value of the CH-MAT is illustrated by a first assessment of global flows via maritime chokepoints. We discuss how such data can be combined with information on inland and overland transport networks, strategic reserves and environmental change, to enhance understanding of the risks associated with disruption to critical infrastructure – owing to weather events, trade restrictions, conflict, congestion, or institutional failures. We consider the applications within risk management frameworks, and governance mechanisms at national, and multilateral level and identify priority measures to enhance global food security.",Chokepoints in global food trade: Assessing the risk,Chokepoint *** Food security *** Risk assessment *** Supply disruption *** Trade,research in transportation business and management,85028825152,2017,,,,,,

"© World Scientific Publishing Company. Reliability of supply chain networks is an important issue affecting customer satisfaction and profitability of organizations. However, occurrence of disruptions such as food, earthquake and fire could ruin performance of supply chains. Uncertainty of parameters is another important factor that could lower quality of long-Term plans of companies. Hence, uncertainty of parameters and disruption strike are important issues adversely influencing reliability of networks. Also, responsiveness of supply chains is a significant matter that should be considered carefully while designing distribution networks. Responsiveness could increase customer loyalty and satisfaction that could result in increasing market share of companies and their long-Term planned benefit. Regarding alluded matters, the aim of this paper is designing a reliable forwardreverse supply chain network that minimizes total costs of network design along with maximization of total responsiveness of distribution network. Extended closed-loop network is capable of considering environmental issues by caring about end-of-life products. Designing reverse supply chain network aside with forward ones could decrease bad environmental impact of end-of-life products. Notably, to cope with adverse effects of disruptions, a scenario-based approach is suggested that enables considering partial and complete disruption of capacity of facilities. Additionally, an effective possibilistic programming method is applied to appropriately control uncertainty of parameters. As quality of raw materials is important to produce high-quality products, minimum acceptable quality level of raw materials is considered in extended model to maximize customer satisfaction. Finally, it should be noted that designed test problems show appropriate performance of suggested model and its applicability in real world case studies. Extended model is solved regarding different risk-Aversion levels and sensitivity analysis is performed for different parameters of network design that shows effectual performance of proposed model.",A possibilistic reliable and responsive closed loop supply chain network design model under uncertainty,Network design *** Possibilistic programming *** Reliability *** Responsiveness *** Supply chain,journal of advanced manufacturing systems,85038116960,2017,,,,,,

"Supplier selection is a critical process in sustainable supply chain management. Increased pressure from stakeholders has forced companies to search for methodologies that help in arriving at intelligent supplier selection decisions. This is a unique study as it illustrates how to optimise orders among various suppliers while taking into consideration all three dimensions of sustainability -economic, social, and environmental. Previous studies have mostly relied on simple ranking of suppliers on the basis of past performance for selection. Those studies that did emphasise on optimisation of orders among suppliers, did not consider all three dimensions of sustainability. To establish an improved sustainable supply chain, this study uses integrated fuzzy AHP and fuzzy multi-objective linear programming approach for order allocation among suppliers. fuzzy AHP has been used for weighing various factors such as quality, lead time, cost, energy use, waste minimisation, emission, and social contribution, and weights of the factors have been considered for developing linear programming. Demand has been taken as a fuzzy variable in this model.

"Responsiveness, robustness and resilience (the Triple R) have become key objectives in global manufacturing, as a way of gaining competitive advantage in the global marketplace. The goal is to hedge against business uncertainties, so as to maximize the robustness of operations, maximize responsiveness by generating operational flexibility at the minimum cost, use of inventories and environmental impact, and to build resilience in global manufacturing, in order to achieve strategic flexibility. The Triple R is achieved by integrating major operational items, including planning, scheduling, real-time optimization and control. This article reviews existing contributions in the field of global manufacturing, and synthesizes these into a single conceptual model of Triple R. The overview is provided in terms of the development of decision support tools and methods, particularly the development of mathematical programming. The review reveals the fact that there have been limited contributions on the social side of sustainability. Environmental impact can be assessed by considering the product life cycle, yet the integration of R&D into global manufacturing operations has received limited contributions. On the modelling side, there are three dominant approaches: transfer pricing, strategic sourcing strategy, and logistics networks design. The paper ends by presenting a conceptual model and providing a methodological procedure for building the Triple R in global manufacturing. We also suggest implementing more advanced modelling and solution methods, which cover not only logistics and transports, but also the integration of concurrent engineering (CE) with aggregate production planning and scheduling.

"The concern about significant changes in the logistics environment, such as the diversification of demands and supply quantities in pickup and delivery processes, has spurred an interest in designing scalable and robust cross-docking planning. In this study, a robust optimization model is introduced to deal with the inherent uncertainty of input data in the location and vehicle routing scheduling problems in cross-docking distribution networks. For this purpose, a new two-phase deterministic mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed for locating cross-docks and scheduling vehicle routing with multiple cross-docks. Then, the robust counterpart of the proposed two-phase MILP model is proposed by employing the recent developments in robust optimization theory. Finally, to evaluate the robustness of obtained solutions by the new robust optimization model, a comparison is made with the obtained solutions by the deterministic MILP model in a number of realizations based on different test problems. Moreover, a meta-heuristic algorithm, namely self-adaptive imperialist competitive algorithm (SAICA), is presented for the multiple vehicle location-routing problems. Finally, this study provides various computational test problems to demonstrate the applicability and capability of the proposed robust two-phase MILP model and meta-heuristic solution approach.",A robust approach to multiple vehicle location-routing problems with time windows for optimization of cross-docking under uncertainty,Cross-docking planning *** location *** vehicle routing scheduling *** robust optimization *** mixed-integer linear programming model *** meta-heuristic algorithms,journal of intelligent & fuzzy systems,WOS:000393537000006,2017,,,,,,
"Although sustainable supply chain (SC) management has been widely investigated in recent years, the focus has mainly been on the practices adopted by a single company, so missing the big picture at SC level. This study of the Italian meat industry considers the SC as a whole, identifying the critical points for each stage in terms of economic, environmental and social sustainability. To this end, a first set of case studies was conducted of companies at different stages of the SC before turning to focus on the meat processing stage, which was identified as critical and highly relevant. A second set of case studies analysed how these companies leverage SC management practices to develop sustainable SCs. In so doing, specific attention was paid to drivers and contingent variables that foster the adoption of sustainable practices. The results of the two steps were then merged to illuminate how practices adopted by the meat processors can impact on the whole chain, confirming their pivotal role in driving sustainability. These results provide a holistic view of the phenomenon, encompassing the entire chain from end to end and highlighting the interdependences across various stages of the meat SC.",Developing sustainability in the Italian meat supply chain: an empirical investigation,supply chain management *** sustainable manufacturing *** food industry *** sustainability *** case studies,international journal of production research,WOS:000394465700014,2017,,,,,,
"The current weaknesses of the conventional intermodal freight transportation system have led to the development of the synchromodal freight transportation concept introduced and piloted in the Netherlands. The innovative concept has the advantage of adding flexibility, cost reduction, and sustainability among other things, into the freight transportation system. The synchromodal system has not been started in any developing country yet due to its newness. In this study, we used multiple methodologies to conduct a feasibility study for the possibilities of introducing the concept in a developing country, Ghana. An intensive literature review was performed using the Grounded Theory and the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) method to identify the key factors for the introduction of the synchromodal concept. Questionnaires were administered to the primary stakeholders in the maritime-hinterland transportation sector to solicit their views about the factors necessary for the implementation. We next carried out SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis to catalogue the strengths and weakness of the country in introducing the concept. The multiple regression analysis method was used to analyse the experience of stakeholders in the freight transportation business and their knowledge about the synchromodal freight transportation system. The results of the study show that it is possible to introduce the concept in the country. However, there is the need to improve the current transportation and ports infrastructure of the country considerably for successful synchromodal system adaptation.

"Recycling waste products is an environmental-friendly activity that can result in manufacturing cost saving and economic efficiency improving. In the beer industry, recycling bottles can reduce manufacturing cost and the industry's carbon footprint.

"Purpose - Due to the ever increasing concern toward sustainability, suppliers nowadays are evaluated on the basis of environmental performances. The data on supplier's performance are not always available in quantitative form and evaluating supplier on the basis of qualitative data is a challenging task. The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework for the selection of suppliers by evaluating them on the basis of both quantitative and qualitative data. Design/methodology/approach - Literature on sustainability, green supply chain and lean practices related to supplier selection is critically reviewed. Based on this, a two phase fuzzy goal programming approach integrating hyperbolic membership function is proposed to solve the complex supplier selection problem. Findings - Results obtained through the proposed approach are compared to the traditional models (Jadidi et al., 2014; Ozkok and Tiryaki, 2011; Zimmermann, 1978) of supplier selection and were found to be optimal as it achieves higher aspiration level. Practical implications - The proposed model is adaptive to solve real world problems of supplier selection as all criteria do not possess the same weights, so the managers can change the criteria and their weights according to their requirement. Originality/value - This paper provides the decision makers a robust framework to evaluate and select sustainable supplier based on both quantitative and qualitative data.

"Due to the increasing awareness of global warming and environmental protection, many practitioners and researchers have paid much attention to the low-carbon supply chain management in recent years. Green supplier selection is one of the most critical activities in the low-carbon supply chain management, so it is important to establish the comprehensive criteria and develop a method for green supplier selection in low-carbon supply chain. The paper proposes a fuzz-grey multicriteria decision making approach to deal with these problems. First, the paper establishes 4 main criteria and 22 subcriteria for green supplier selection. Then, a method integrating fuzzy set theory and grey relational analysis is proposed. It uses the membership function of normal distribution to compare each supplier and uses grey relation analysis to calculate the weight of each criterion and improves fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. The proposed method can make the localization of individual green supplier more objectively and more accurately in the same trade.

"© 2017 IEEE. As the complexity of supply chain structures and the frequency of their disruptions rise, businesses are increasingly recognizing the value of supply chain reliability and resilience (SCRR). A number of efforts have been devoted to define SCRR or to develop risk mitigation strategies for their improvement. However, a key question remaining to be answered is how SCRR should be quantified. Existing methods are insufficient in addressing this question on two important fronts: First, they do not adequately represent the interdependencies between different supply chain nodes; second, they do not allow for the modeling of actionable decisions and thus cannot be used to guide improvement strategies. This paper aims to fill this gap by proposing a unified framework for evaluating SCRR that internalizes design inputs and is flexible to varying degrees of data availability. The proposed framework captures risks involved in the supply, the demand, the firm itself, and the external environment. It also contributes to the literature by relating SCRR to the supply chain’s risk-mitigating capabilities prior to or postdisruptions. A novel method using the supply chain’s inherent buyer–supplier relationships is designed to model node interdependencies. Two example applications are discussed to demonstrate how this framework can be utilized to assist in reliable and resilient supply chain design.",A unified framework for evaluating supply chain reliability and resilience,Bayesian methods *** Design *** Reliability *** Resilience *** Supply chain management *** Supply chain risk propagation *** System analysis,ieee transactions on reliability,85028729578,2017,,,,,,
"© 2017 American Chemical Society. The optimal design and planning of glycerol-based biorefinery supply chains is critical for the development and implementation of this concept in a sustainable manner. To achieve this, a decision-making framework is proposed in this work, to holistically optimize the design and planning of the glycerol-based biorefinery supply chains under uncertainties. This framework presents a multilayered strategy composed of different steps, and it is strongly based on optimization techniques, detailed economic and environmental assessment, and multiobjective optimization under a stochastic environment. To maximize the business value, the economic objective is measured by the Net Present Value (NPV), whereas the environmental performance is measured by the estimation of a Single Indicator (SI) through the application of LCA methods. As part of the framework, a stochastic multiperiod, multiproduct, and multiechelon mixed integer linear programming problem is proposed based upon a previous model, GlyThink. In the new formulation, market uncertainties are taken into account at the strategic planning level. The robustness of the supply chain structures is analyzed based on statistical data provided by the implementation of the Monte Carlo method, where a deterministic optimization problem is solved for each scenario. Furthermore, the solution of the stochastic multiobjective optimization model points to the Pareto set of trade-off solutions obtained when maximizing the NPV and minimizing environmental consequences. Therefore, the proposed framework ultimately leads to the identification of the optimal design and planning decisions for the development of environmentally conscious biorefinery supply chains. The effectiveness of the presented approach is demonstrated through its application to the realistic case study of the glycerol-based biorefinery in Europe, where the results showed that the optimal solution under market uncertainties is obtained by establishing a multiplant supply chain for the glycerol-based integrated biorefinery, built upon two plant site locations (Germany, France) based on the production of succinic acid and lactic acid.",Optimal Design and Planning of Glycerol-Based Biorefinery Supply Chains under Uncertainty, ,industrial and engineering chemistry research,85032858416,2017,,,,,,

A recipe comprising image processing techniques and measurement of similarity indices has been developed. These signatures are proposed to be fabricated at the manufacturer side of the supply chain. Then, they are decoded at the consumer end. Thus, robustness against ambient environment and aging is a requirement for these signatures to survive in the global supply chain.

"© 2017 Elsevier Ltd The emergence of concerns over environmental protection, resource conservation as well as the development of logistics operations and manufacturing technology has led several countries to implement formal collection and recycling systems of solid waste. Such recycling system has the benefits of reducing environmental pollution, boosting the economy by creating new jobs, and generating income from trading the recyclable materials. This leads to the formation of a global reverse supply chain (GRSC) of solid waste. In this paper, we investigate the design of such a GRSC with a special emphasis on three aspects; (1) uncertainty of waste collection levels, (2) associated carbon emissions, and (3) challenges posed by the supply chain's global aspect, particularly the maritime transportation costs and currency exchange rates. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to integrate the three above-mentioned important aspects in the design of a GRSC. We have used mixed integer-linear programming method along with robust optimization to develop the model which is validated using a sample case study of e-waste management. Our results show that using a robust model by taking the complex interactions characterizing global reverse supply chain networks into account, we can create a better GRSC. The effect of uncertainties and carbon constraints on decisions to reduce costs and emissions are also shown.",Global reverse supply chain design for solid waste recycling under uncertainties and carbon emission constraint,Carbon emission *** Global supply chain *** Reverse supply chain *** Solid waste recycling,waste management,85015370220,2017,,,,,,

The edge betweenness centrality in the global supply chain networks is newly formulated and a relationship between edge betweenness centrality and vertex betweenness centrality is further provided. The empirical analysis based on the world input-output database covering 35 industrial sectors and 41 countries and regions in 2008 shows that specifically, China's Electrical and Optical Equipment sector, which has a higher edge and vertex betweenness centrality, is the most critical sector in global supply chain networks in terms of spreading CO2 emissions along its supply chain paths. We suggest greener supply chain engagement centered around the China's Electrical and Optical Equipment sector and other key sectors identified in this study.","Finding environmentally critical transmission sectors, transactions, and paths in global supply chain networks",CO 2 *** Edge betweenness centrality *** Global supply chain networks *** Network analysis *** Vertex betweenness centrality *** World input-output database,energy economics,85033438514,2017,,,,,,
"© 2017 by the authors. Although climate change can induce large-scale impacts on industrial supply chain networks, first empirical studies suggest that adaptation to climate change is only slowly emerging as a management topic in firms. The present study examines why managers often do not engage their firms in adaptations to climate change. Thereby the study focuses, in particular, on the lack of strategic adaptation, which we define as anticipatory and target-oriented action with the purpose of increasing resilience to climate change. In order to investigate causes of lacking strategic adaptation in firms, the study employs a behavioral perspective based on the reasoned action approach. Thus, the study examines how barriers and motivational factors jointly shape the non-adaptive behavior of firm managers. Such causes of non-adaptive behavior are examined by comparing different classes of non-adaptors based on a case study in the manufacturing industry of the Austrian state of Tyrol. The obtained results underline recent criticism on barrier-centered analyses of non-adaptation by demonstrating the importance of motivational factors. Moreover, results point to the changeable nature of the identified causes of non-adaptive behavior by clarifying interactions between them and by suggesting influences from background factors.",Non-adaptive behavior in the face of climate change: First insights from a behavioral perspective based on a case study among firm managers in alpine Austria,Actor-centered approach *** Barriers *** Behavioral perspective *** Climate change adaptation *** Manufacturing industry *** Motivational factors,sustainability (switzerland),85021656800,2017,,,,,,
"© 2017 Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation There is renewed interest in expanded agricultural development in northern Australia supported by increasing global demand for food, the region's proximity to Asian markets, and the current government policy initiatives to support economically sustainable and vibrant rural and regional communities. The production potential, financial returns, and the supply chain implications for irrigated agriculture were assessed in four different regions across northern Australia to provide a systems analysis of development opportunities and challenges. Gross margins for high volume, low value broadacre crops were mostly either negative or weakly positive, principally due to high transport costs to established markets in southern and eastern Australia. The returns were largely positive for higher value horticultural and specialist niche crops or industrial crops with local processing facilities. Scenarios incorporating alternative transport routes to Asia provided modest cost savings, but required assumptions for suitable shipping routes and cost-effective availability of containers, but did not significantly boost gross margins. When scaled to whole irrigation areas, the regional gross value of production could be significant but improving returns at farm scale requires more cost-effective supply chains. The ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investment was strongly influenced by the sequence of years associated with climatic variability and/or other unexpected shocks experienced in the years immediately following investment. The analysis highlighted that each component of the system – climate, soils, water, agronomic practice, pests and diseases, farm operations, management, planning, supply chains, infrastructure, labour, services, markets – needs to be understood but ultimate success will depend on managing the complexity of the whole farming system and value-chain. Further, scaling up development at a considered pace and being prepared for considerable lags before positive returns on investment are achieved will be critical for successful long-term irrigated agricultural ventures in northern Australia.",Irrigated agricultural development in northern Australia: Value-chain challenges and opportunities, ,agricultural systems,85019155776,2017,,,,,,
"© Archives of Environmental Protection 2017. The main goal of this work is to show the new approach to determining safety technological levels (SLs) in terms of water quality and its chemical stability, as well as issues of water corrosion properties in water distribution systems (WDSs), due to the fact that water supply pipes are prone to corrosion. In the paper the methodology of determining the risk associated with threat to technical infrastructure was considered. The concept was studied on the basis of real operational data from the water treatment plant. The probability of exceeding the individual parameters for WTPI is slightly larger than for WTPII, which means that this water treatment process may cause lack of chemical stability in the water supply network. Operators should anticipate in the process of designing water distribution system, using proper materials, as to ensure an adequate level of safety from the water source to the water recipient. It should be noted that it is necessary to adjust the material of internal installation of water supply networks to the parameters of the water. At present, there are no correlations between the designing step and water parameters. It was concluded that to protect the water supply infrastructure, which belongs to critical infrastructure, water company should put more emphasis on distribution of stable water that has not potentially corrosion properties. Some suggestions were made for the protection of WDS and to ensure safety of system functioning and long-term usability of water pipes.",Analysis of chemical stability of tap water in terms of required level of technological safety,chemical stability of water *** corrosion indices *** risk criteria *** technological safety,archives of environmental protection,85039151686,2017,,,,,,
"© 2017 by the authors. In the growing and turbulent market of the current world both in national and in international relations, the need for reviewing and assessment of the resiliency of suppliers as one of the new concepts in supply chain management has been prioritized. In addition, globalization, increasing the regulations of governmental and non-governmental organizations, customers' request and pressure regarding environmental issues has led organizations to evaluate the measures necessary to implement green supply chain management, to improve their environmental and economic performance. The subject of selecting and evaluating suppliers on green supply chain with resilience capability first requires the identification of the supplier evaluation criteria so that it considers the resiliency of the supply chain concurrent with the concepts of green supply chain. Secondly, right tools should be used for the decision. Considering all the criteria and indicators in conditions of uncertainty encourages the development and application of methods, such as fuzzy theory and grey systems theory. In this research, a comprehensive model for evaluating green resilience supply chain network is provided. In order to apply both quantitative and qualitative criteria, the possibility of making the target based criteria dimensionless along the cost or benefit criteria, the use of experts' opinions in the allocation of weights to the criteria and indicators using grey numbers, grey relational analysis are developed and improved. In the end, the implementation of the proposed model is explained step by step in a case study and the future conclusions and recommendations are suggested.",An improved hybrid grey relational analysis approach for green resilient supply chain network assessment,Green resilient supplier selection *** Grey relational analysis *** Supply chain network *** Target-based criteria,sustainability (switzerland),85027721626,2017,,,,,,
"© 2017 by the authors. This paper explores the challenges related to the End-Of-Life phase of products and circular systems of reuse and recycling within the commonly established frameworks of product lifecycles. Typically, Original Equipment Manufacturer-centric supply chain perspectives neglect the complexity at the End-Of-Life where many third-parties are involved in reuse and recycling activities. Based on a review of product lifecycle and related recycling literature, this study proposes the application of 'cascades', a term originally coined within the biomass domain. We propose and subsequently apply the 'cascade use methodology' and identify additional and value-adding End-Of-Life solutions for products and materials. The adoption of cascade utilization into product lifecycles is analyzed and critically discussed using case studies from independent remanufacturing and tire recycling, focusing on the End-Of-Life while excluding business models as renting or sharing. Although theoretically feasible, we argue that the practical adoption of 'cascade use' deserves more attention from researchers and practitioners in order to become an integral part of the comprehensive management of product lifecycles.",Cascade use and the management of product lifecycles,Cascade utilization *** Closed-loop supply chains (CLSC) *** Product life cycle *** Product lifecycle management (PLM) *** Recycling *** Remanufacturing *** reuse,sustainability (switzerland),85028599527,2017,,,,,,

In recent years, the growing attention to environmental challenges has shown that these issues are becoming of more and more interest to both research and industry. Companies are expected to ensure their products are fully traceable and more sustainable, which requires the involvement of all of the actors in the production network. According to this aim, this study proposes a structured approach that uses the traditional traceability concept as a means to identify the main information needed to assess environmental impacts along the whole supply chain (SC). The proposed approach is composed of four main steps: (i) SC modelling to identify all stakeholders and their inter-relations, (ii) data sharing to collect all relevant data, (iii) data elaboration to calculate performance at different levels of detail and (iv) result interpretation to optimise the SC. The distributed implementation of the approach at different SC steps represents a useful means to practically realise a sustainable SC management. A case study involving a leather shoe SC is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in identifying criticalities, supporting the selection of the most appropriate suppliers and correctly setting a management strategy towards the optimisation of internal and external traceability and environmental sustainability performances.",Traceability as a means to investigate supply chain sustainability: The real case of a leather shoe supply chain,Collaborative network *** Environmental sustainability *** Sustainable supply chain *** Sustainable supply chain management *** Traceability,international journal of production research,85042346140,2017,,,,,,

"© 2017 Elsevier Ltd In recent years, due to environmental concerns, remanufacturing of products is practiced in different companies and closed loop supply chain network in these companies is significant to optimize. Therefore, current study is aimed to determine an optimal closed loop supply chain network, which is composed of multiple producers, remanufacturers, intermediate centers and customer centers. Furthermore, uncertainty in the demand and uncertainty in the quantity of returned products is considered simultaneously in the network to make it significantly useful in the uncertain environment. A novel genetic artificial bee colony (GABC) algorithm is introduced with a new food source representation for the current problem. The proposed GABC algorithm considered neighbor food sources for local search and used crossover and mutation operations of genetic algorithm to enhance the exploration ability of the proposed algorithm. Taguchi method is employed to compute the optimal parameters of GABC for two different size test problems taken from literature and a Case problem which are modified according to the current research problem. The performance of presented GABC algorithm is tested by comparing the results of considered test problems with the results obtained from the original artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA). Moreover, to test the robustness of the proposed GABC algorithm, different scenarios of small and large size problems based on the quantity of demand and variations in demand are made to perform the experiments. Results indicate that proposed GABC outperforms standard ABC and GA in different scenarios to give smaller value of the total cost of network and gives more robust results to give smaller variations in the total cost of network due to uncertain variations in the demand, as compared to original ABC and GA.d",Close loop supply chain network problem with uncertainty in demand and returned products: Genetic artificial bee colony algorithm approach,Close loop supply chain network *** Demand uncertainty *** Genetic artificial bee colony algorithm *** Remanufacturing,journal of cleaner production,85024121360,2017,,,,,,
"© 2017 Elsevier Ltd The diversity of materials employed in modern products and the complexity of globalized supply chains raise the importance of assessing supply risk of commodity inputs to product systems. Therefore, this article extends the Geopolitical Supply Risk methodology by proposing a characterization model to quantify product supply risk in relation to a functional unit under the Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment framework. The characterization model is based on a socio-economic cause-effect mechanism drawing upon supply chain resilience concepts. Supply risk – or “criticality” – of a given “intermediate product” is defined as the multiple of probability of supply disruption and vulnerability to supply disruption. Two embodiments of the characterization model are proposed, each supplementing the previously developed probability indicators with different indicators for vulnerability. They are demonstrated with a comparative case study of an electric vehicle and internal combustion engine vehicle. The results are highly sensitive to how vulnerability is measured, and a number of methodological complications arise. The most promising embodiment of the characterization model “cancels out” the amounts of commodity inputs, as it can be strongly argued that every input to the product system is equally important for product performance as expressed by the functional unit. Thus, the Geopolitical Supply Risk characterization model shows the importance of integrating raw material criticality considerations into Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment to better inform management decisions at a product level.",Extension of geopolitical supply risk methodology: Characterization model applied to conventional and electric vehicles,Criticality assessment *** Electric vehicle *** Life cycle assessment *** Life cycle sustainability assessment *** Product supply risk *** Vulnerability,journal of cleaner production,85024118808,2017,,,,,,
"© 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC Hydrogen has an instrumental role to play in shaping the future of the UK's transport system. Huge reductions in ‘Greenhouse Gas’ (GHG) emissions may be achievable whilst providing a secure source of clean and sustainable fuel. Hydrogen transition has already begun but to strengthen and power the ‘hydrogen economy’ momentum in the UK, the development of the hydrogen infrastructure needs to make progress more quickly. There are many challenges associated with this due to the complexity at each node of Hydrogen Supply Chains (HSC), such as the number of processes to produce hydrogen. This raises the challenge to model HSCs, allowing analysis of various pathways and optimal configurations. This report aims firstly, to review the factors discussed in the literature on HSC and identify gaps or issues that require further debate with regards to introducing hydrogen in the transport system. Secondly, various HSC modelling techniques have been categorised according to mathematical methods used and the factors being considered. Studies in the literature have analysed hydrogen transport systems in terms of capital and operating costs of the infrastructure, and the cost of hydrogen, environmental implications and risk. A significant market share can be obtained by hydrogen in the near future with the minimisation of cost across the supply chain from production to end-use. Effective policies are required to speed up the process and increase the energy efficiency alongside mitigating GHGs and improving fuel security. Further developments in the mathematical optimisation models and technical breakthrough will enable the transition to a hydrogen economy take place with minimum disruption and issues.",Review of modelling approaches used in the HSC context for the UK,GIS-based approaches *** Hydrogen infrastructure *** Hydrogen supply chains *** Optimisation *** System dynamics,international journal of hydrogen energy,85029658337,2017,,,,,,
"© 2017 Elsevier Ltd Background There is an urgent need to drive improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of food chains. The global population is expected to reach at least 9 billion by the year 2050, requiring up to 70% more food, and demanding food production systems and the food chain to become fully sustainable. This challenge is complicated by a number of overarching issues, including increasing complexity of food supply chains, environmental constraints, a growing aging population and changing patterns of consumer choice and food consumption. Within this context, food safety must be an enabler and not inhibitor of global food security. Scope and approach This paper will highlight how recent developments and trends related to food safety will impact the food sector and ultimately the ability of the sector to deliver food security. Key findings and conclusions Global megatrends including climate change, a growing and aging population, urbanisation, and increased affluence will create food safety challenges and place new demands on producers, manufacturers, marketers, retailers and regulators. Advances in science and technology such as whole genome sequencing, active packaging, developments in tracing and tracking technologies, information computing technology and big data analysis has the potential to help mitigate the challenges and meet demands, but will also create new challenges. Overcoming a number of these challenges will be difficult for developed economies and large food companies, but even greater for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), developing economies and smallholder farmers, noting that each is a critical component in the global food supply.",Food safety for food security: Relationship between global megatrends and developments in food safety,Food industry *** Food safety *** Food safety communication *** Food security *** Global megatrends *** Regulation,trends in food science and technology,85028468776,2017,,,,,,

Supply chain network designing and programming is a momentous issue that many practitioners have focused on and contributed numerous novelties for this prompt. This paper puts forward a fuzzy multi-agent system according to which compatible with the decision makers’ interests and environmental survey, identifies the parameters of the mathematical model. An embedded optimization party including evolutionary-based optimizer intelligent agents, obtains non-dominated potential solutions. The output of these optimizer agents during the calibration process is an underpinning for evaluating the performance of the party. The system makes the policy of optimization complying with the results evaluation as well as the decision makers’ elaborated desires. Afterwards, in step with this policy, it sets a pool from obtained Pareto Fronts and aggregates them to extract a set of the best individuals. It interactively represents this set to the decision makers and catches their desired circumstance amongst these optional solutions. Proposing the network graph and program—which its generic morphography is determined—for decision makers is contrived as the system last stage. The main competencies of this system could be contemplated regarding the facts that it interactively fulfills the decision makers’ utilities relying on its robustness in optimization, self-tuning, training loop, ambient intelligence and consciousness toward the changes in environment.",Evolutionary fuzzy intelligent system for multi-objective supply chain network designs: an agent-based optimization state of the art,Agent-based optimization *** Fuzzy inference *** Performance evaluation and approximation *** Supply chain network,journal of intelligent manufacturing,84948171212,2017,,,,,,

"© 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. Purpose – Supply chains (SCs) have become increasingly vulnerable to catastrophic events/disruptions that may be natural or man-made. Hurricanes, tsunamis and floods are natural disasters, whereas man-made disasters may be strikes, terrorist attacks, etc. Failure at any point in the SC network has the potential to cause the entire network to fail. SCs must therefore be properly designed to survive well in the disruption scenario. The capability of successful survival (of the firm’s SC) against those adverse events/happenings is termed as resilience; and, the SC designed under resilience consideration is called a resilient SC. Effective supplier selection is considered as a key strategic consideration in SC management. It is felt that apart from considering traditional suppliers selection criterions, suppliers’ resiliency strategy must be incorporated while selecting a potential supplier which can provide best support to the firm even in the disaster/disruption scenario. The purpose of this paper is to focus aspects of evaluation and selection of resilience supplier by considering general as well as resiliency strategy, simultaneously. Design/methodology/approach – In this work, subjectivity associated with ill-defined (vague) evaluation information has been tackled through logical exploration of fuzzy numbers set theory. Application of VIKOR embedded with fuzzy mathematics has been utilized here. Sensitivity analysis has been performed to reflect the effect of decision-makers’ (DM) risk bearing attitude in selecting the best potential supplier in a resilient SC. A case empirical example has also been presented. Findings – The work attempts to focus on a decision-making procedural hierarchy towards effective supplier selection in a resilient SC. The work exhibits application potential of VIKOR method integrated with fuzzy set theory to select potential supplier based on general strategy as well as resiliency strategy. The final supplier selection score (obtained by considering general strategy) and that of obtained by analyzing resiliency strategy have been combined to get a final compromise solution. The decision-support framework thus reported here also considers DMs’ risk bearing attitude. Practical implications – The study bears significant impact to the industry managers who are trying to adapt resiliency strategy in their SC followed by potential supplier selection in the context of resilient SC. Originality/value – Exploration of VIKOR embedded with fuzzy set theory towards suppliers’ evaluation and selection by considering general and resiliency criteria both.

"© 2016 American Chemical Society. To develop industry-specific policies for mitigating environmental pressures, previous studies primarily focus on identifying sectors that directly generate large amounts of environmental pressures (a.k.a. production-based method) or indirectly drive large amounts of environmental pressures through supply chains (e.g., consumption-based method). In addition to those sectors as important environmental pressure producers or drivers, there exist sectors that are also important to environmental pressure mitigation as transmission centers. Economy-wide environmental pressure mitigation might be achieved by improving production efficiency of these key transmission sectors, that is, using less upstream inputs to produce unitary output. We develop a betweenness-based method to measure the importance of transmission sectors, borrowing the betweenness concept from network analysis. We quantify the betweenness of sectors by examining supply chain paths extracted from structural path analysis that pass through a particular sector. We take China as an example and find that those critical transmission sectors identified by betweenness-based method are not always identifiable by existing methods. This indicates that betweenness-based method can provide additional insights that cannot be obtained with existing methods on the roles individual sectors play in generating economy-wide environmental pressures. Betweenness-based method proposed here can therefore complement existing methods for guiding sector-level environmental pressure mitigation strategies.",Betweenness-Based Method to Identify Critical Transmission Sectors for Supply Chain Environmental Pressure Mitigation, ,environmental science and technology,84957545021,2016,,,,,,

Without them, the offerings of an enormous variety of modern conveniences, including computers and mobile phones, would not be possible. The production of these everyday items depends on a secure, sustainable, and reliable supply of critical raw materials. In addition, product development also requires new hybrid materials when targeting lightweight structures, etc. However, the mandatory recyclability of new products or materials is not obligatory or even prevailing practice in present manufacturing business. Therefore, the main research question in this article is: “how to solve the challenge of recycling in industrial system?” In this article, a comprehensive approach to recycling based on the findings of research projects is presented. Simplified, this involves moving the challenge from the end of the product’s life cycle to the beginning, to the design or even to material development phases. Life cycle and system thinking and material know-how in the design phase are found to be essential elements of a new approach to recycling. This approach stems from the material development and market economy perspectives. Furthermore, the vulnerability of the industrial system to create uncertainty to recycling is also demonstrated.",Recycling – the importance of understanding the complexity of the issue,Decision-making *** life cycle thinking in design and development processes *** material efficiency *** recycling *** saving primary raw material *** supply chain management,international journal of sustainable engineering,84940061708,2016,,,,,,
"© 2015 The Authors. The paper describes an approach to landscape design that focuses on integrating bioenergy production with other components of environmental, social and economic systems. Landscape design as used here refers to a spatially explicit, collaborative plan for management of landscapes and supply chains. Landscape design can involve multiple scales and build on existing practices to reduce costs or enhance services. Appropriately applied to a specific context, landscape design can help people assess trade-offs when making choices about locations, types of feedstock, transport, refining and distribution of bioenergy products and services. The approach includes performance monitoring and reporting along the bioenergy supply chain. Examples of landscape design applied to bioenergy production systems are presented. Barriers to implementation of landscape design include high costs, the need to consider diverse land-management objectives from a wide array of stakeholders, up-front planning requirements, and the complexity and level of effort needed for successful stakeholder involvement. A landscape design process may be stymied by insufficient data or participation. An impetus for coordination is critical, and incentives may be required to engage landowners and the private sector. Hence devising and implementing landscape designs for more sustainable outcomes require clear communication of environmental, social, and economic opportunities and concerns.",Incorporating bioenergy into sustainable landscape designs,Adaptive management *** Biofuel *** Planning *** Resource management *** Scale *** Stakeholder,renewable and sustainable energy reviews,84952360783,2016,,,,,,
"© 2015, The Natural Computing Applications Forum. Supplier evaluation plays a critical role in a successful supply chain management. Hence, the evaluation and selection of the right suppliers have become a central decision of manufacturing business activities around the world. Consequently, numerous individual and integrated methods have been presented to evaluate and select suppliers. The current literature shows that hybrid artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have received much attention for supplier evaluation. Integrated data envelopment analysis–artificial neural network (DEA–ANN) is one of the combined methods that have recently garnered great attention from academics and practitioners. However, DEA–ANN model has some drawbacks, which make some limitation in the evaluation process. In this study, we aim at improving the previous DEA–AI models by integrating the Kourosh and Arash method as a robust model of DEA with a new AI approach namely genetic programming (GP) to overcome the shortcomings of previous DEA–AI models in supplier selection. Indeed, in this paper, GP provides a robust nonlinear mathematical equation for the suppliers’ efficiency using the determined criteria. To validate the model, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system as a powerful tool was used to compare the result with GP-based model. In addition, parametric analysis and unseen data set were used to validate the precision of the model.",An integrated model for green supplier selection under fuzzy environment: application of data envelopment analysis and genetic programming approach,Artificial intelligence *** Data envelopment analysis (DEA) *** Genetic programming (GP) *** Green supplier selection *** Parametric analysis,neural computing and applications,84928137501,2016,,,,,,

The proposed algorithm defines the location and capacities of the supply chain entities (factories, warehouses and distribution centers) chooses the technologies to be installed in each production facility and defines the inventory profiles and material flows during the planning time horizon. Profit maximization and environmental impacts minimization are considered. The algorithm, MBSA, explores the feasible solution space using a new Local Search strategy with a Multi-Start mechanism. The performance of the proposed methodology is compared with an exact approach supported by a Pareto Frontier and as main conclusions it can be stated that the proposed algorithm proves to be very efficient when solving this type of complex problems. Several Key Performance Indicators are developed to validate the algorithm robustiveness and, in addition, the proposed approach is validated through the solution of several instances.",A multi-objective meta-heuristic approach for the design and planning of green supply chains - MBSA,Meta-heuristics *** Multi-objective *** Simulated annealing *** Supply chains,expert systems with applications,84949509835,2016,,,,,,
"© 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. This paper presents a multi-period, multi-objective optimization model that enables robust production network and location planning during times of increased market uncertainty and risk exposure in environmental factors. The planning model focuses primarily on integrating the quantitative and qualitative risk factors associated with strategic production network planning. Integration was realized by linking a robust programming model with aspects of multi-target optimization using an EPSILON-constraint approach. This allows quantitative risks such as fluctuations in demand, exchange rates, and transportation costs to be factored into a common mixed-integer optimization model as discrete scenarios, with qualitative risks, e.g., security risks, accounted for as part of a points-based evaluation approach. The developed model minimizes the firm's expected downside risk exposure while meeting a pre-selected threshold level for environmental risks. The trade-off between risk and profit is depicted and interpreted using a Pareto analysis. The developed model makes it possible to characterize a variety of risks that are very difficult to manage when carrying out strategic planning of production networks in practice.",Transparency of risk for global and complex network decisions in the automotive industry,Automotive *** Multicriteria *** Production network *** Risk *** Supplychain,international journal of production economics,84959308774,2016,,,,,,
"© 2015 Taylor  &  Francis. Recent research has demonstrated the potential benefits of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology in the supply chain and production management via its item-level visibility. However, the RFID coverage performance is largely impacted by the surrounding environment and potential collisions between the RFID devices. Thus, through RFID network planning (RNP) to achieve the desired coverage within the budget becomes a key factor for success. In this study, we establish a novel and generic multi-objective RNP model by simultaneously optimising two conflicted objectives with satisfying the heterogeneous coverage requirements. Then, we design an improved multi-objective genetic algorithm (IMOGA) integrating a divide-and-conquer greedy heuristic algorithm to solve the model. We further construct a number of computational cases abstracted from an automobile mixed-model assembly line to illustrate how the proposed model and algorithm are applied in a real RNP application. The results show that the proposed IMOGA achieves highly competitive solutions compared with Pareto optimal solutions and the solutions given by four recently developed well-known multi-objective evolutionary and swarm-based optimisers (SPEA2, NSGA-II, MOPSO and MOPS2O) in terms of solution quality and computational robustness.",An improved multi-objective genetic algorithm for heterogeneous coverage RFID network planning,heterogeneous coverage *** mixed-model assembly line *** multi-objective genetic algorithm *** RFID network planning,international journal of production research,84933055889,2016,,,,,,
"© 2016 American Chemical Society. Metals are used in numerous products and are sourced via increasingly global and complex supply chains. Monetary input-output tables (MIOT) and network analysis can be applied to intersectoral supply chains and used to analyze structural aspects. We first provide a concise review of the literature related to network analysis applied to MIOTs. On the basis of a physical input-output table (PIOT) table of aluminum in the United States economy in 2007, we identify key sectors and discuss the overall topology of the aluminum network using tools of network analysis. Sectors highly dependent on metal product inputs or sales are identified using weighted degree centrality and their hierarchical organization is explored via clustering. Betweenness centrality and random walk centrality (page rank) are explored as means to identify network bottlenecks and relative sector importance. Aluminum, even though dominated by uses in the automobile, beverage and containers, and construction industries, finds application in a wide range of sectors. Motor vehicle parts manufacturing relies on a large number of upstream and downstream suppliers to function. We conclude by analyzing structural aspects of a subnetwork for automobile manufacturing and discuss how the use of network analysis relates to current criticality analyses of metal and mineral resources.",Structural Investigation of Aluminum in the U.S. Economy using Network Analysis, ,environmental science and technology,84964342439,2016,,,,,,
"© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. Environmentalism has become an important global issue in the present century. During the recent years, the closed-loop green supply chain management has been increasingly a center of attention as a result of governmental laws and legislations (regarding the environmental effects of any activity) and the soaring consumers' expectations. In this study, effort has been made to investigate a facility location/allocation model for a multi-product closed-loop green supply chain network consisting of manufacturing/remanufacturing and collection/inspection centers as well as disposal center and markets. To design the network, we have proposed a mixed-integer linear programming model capable of reducing the network total costs. The model has been so developed as to consider such environmental objectives as reducing the rate of carbon dioxide emission in the environment throughout the network in question. Moreover, the model has been developed using a robust fuzzy programming approach to investigate the effects of uncertainties of the variable costs, as well as the demand rate, on the network design. To solve the bi-objective programming model, use has been made of the ε-constraint approach and a numerical illustration of Copiers Industry is used to show the applicability of the proposed optimization model. Results have revealed that the model is capable of controlling the network uncertainties as a result of which a robustness price will be imposed on the system.",A robust fuzzy optimization model for carbon-efficient closed-loop supply chain network design problem: A numerical illustration in electronics industry,Carbon dioxide emission *** Chance constrained fuzzy programming *** Closed-loop green supply chain network *** Facility location *** Robust optimization,journal of cleaner production,84961655067,2016,,,,,,
"© 2016. The Author(s). Stewardship is a popular term for the principles and actions aimed at improving sustainability and resilience of social-ecological systems at various scales and in different contexts. Participation in stewardship is voluntary, and is based on values of altruism and long-term benefits. At a global scale, 'earth stewardship' is viewed as a successor to earlier natural resource management systems. However, in South Africa, stewardship is narrowly applied to biodiversity conservation agreements on private land. Using a broader definition of stewardship, we identify all potentially related schemes that may contribute to sustainability and conservation outcomes. Stewardship schemes and actors are represented as a social network and placed in a simple typology based on objectives, mechanisms of action and operational scales. The predominant type was biodiversity stewardship programmes. The main actors were environmental non-governmental organisations participating in prominent bioregional landscape partnerships, together acting as important 'bridging organisations' within local stewardship networks. This bridging enables a high degree of collaboration between non-governmental and governmental bodies, especially provincial conservation agencies via mutual projects and conservation objectives. An unintended consequence may be that management accountability is relinquished or neglected by government because of inadequate implementation capacity. Other stewardship types, such as market-based and landscape initiatives, complemented primarily biodiversity ones, as part of national spatial conservation priorities. Not all schemes related to biodiversity, especially those involving common pool resources, markets and supply chains. Despite an apparent narrow biodiversity focus, there is evidence of diversification of scope to include more civic and community-level stewardship activities, in line with the earth stewardship metaphor.",A broader view of stewardship to achieve conservation and sustainability goals in South Africa,Biodiversity *** Earth stewardship *** Eco-labels *** Ecosystem services *** Natural resource management,south african journal of science,84971469237,2016,,,,,,

Given the increasing complexity of modern electronics and the cost of fabrication, entities from around the globe have become more heavily involved in all phases of the electronics supply chain. In this environment, hardware Trojans (i.e., malicious modifications or inclusions made by untrusted third parties) pose major security concerns, especially for those integrated circuits (ICs) and systems used in critical applications and cyber infrastructure. While hardware Trojans have been explored significantly in academia over the last decade, there remains room for improvement. In this article, we examine the research on hardware Trojans from the last decade and attempt to capture the lessons learned. A comprehensive adversarial model taxonomy is introduced and used to examine the current state of the art. Then the past countermeasures and publication trends are categorized based on the adversarial model and topic. Through this analysis, we identify what has been covered and the important problems that are underinvestigated.

"© 2016 The Author(s) Networked service organisations are increasingly adopting a ‘smarter networking’ philosophy in their design of more agile and customer-focused supply models. Changing consumer behaviours and the emergence of transformative technologies—industry 4.0, artificial intelligence, big data analytics, the Internet of Things—are driving a series of innovations, in terms of ‘products’ and business models, with major implications for the industrial enterprise, in their design of more ‘digitalised’ supply chains. For B2B systems, emerging ‘product-service’ offerings are requiring greater visibility, alignment and integration across an increasingly complex network of multiple partners and collaborators, in order to deliver a better service and customer ‘experience’. To support the design and operation of these multi-organisational service networks, we outline a concept of operations architecture here, underpinned by the literature and network theory, and demonstrate application using a series of exemplar case studies. Focusing on relational elements and the processes key to network integration within service supply networks, the cases inform a set of operating principles and protocols—applicable to all stakeholders ‘cooperating’, within a ‘shared’ environment. Equally critical is to understand how digital technologies may influence future operating philosophies. This article extends our theoretical understanding of network organisations, from a traditional ‘product’ perspective to that of ‘services’, and presents the case for developing a common, unified approach to designing diverse forms of multi-partner service networks.",Designing a ‘concept of operations’ architecture for next-generation multi-organisational service networks,Digital technologies *** Multi-organisational service networks *** Network and data integration *** Operating principles and protocols *** Product-service systems,ai and society,84969150924,2016,,,,,,
"© 2016 by the authors. The production of soy is one of the most important economic activities in the Brazilian Amazon, though the expansion of this industry has come at the cost of huge swaths of forest. Since 2006, the private firms that buy and trade soybeans globally have assumed a key role in ensuring that soy producers comply with forest protection policies, including the Soy Moratorium and public policies banning the use of illegally deforested land. We used evidence from field interviews and a GIS of property boundaries and soy-production areas to describe the private sector governance process and to characterize the variety of property arrangements underlying soy production in Mato Grosso, the leading soy-producing state in the Brazilian Amazon. These increasingly complex property arrangements include ownership of multiple properties by a single producer, use of rental properties owned by others, and soy and cattle production on a single property. This complexity could create loopholes allowing soy associated with deforestation to enter the supply chain. Comprehensive soy-governance strategies that include more robust procedures for verifying the provenance of soy across all properties, that account for the entire property rather than only the area planted to soy, and that use more transparent verification systems could achieve greater reductions in deforestation.",Property arrangements and soy governance in the brazilian state of mato grosso: Implications for deforestation-free production,Amazon *** Brazil *** Deforestation *** Environmental governance *** land holdings *** Soy *** Soy moratorium,land,85019232194,2016,,,,,,
"Our case study of Salers cheese production in south-central France highlights how place-specific knowledge grounds the various networks shaping the rise of geographical indications (GI) in food production. In 1961, Salers cheese producers created a ""Protected Designation of Origin"" (PDO). To preserve the distinctive character of their product, they opted to require use of the gerle, a traditional wooden vat, and an on-farm cheese making process. The gerle came recently under scrutiny from French governmental hygiene regulation enforcement, and the subsequent public controversy jeopardized the entire supply chain and destabilized Salers cheese-making methods. Prevailing in their efforts to protect Salers, producers established the gerle as mandatory and have since set up a governance board to ensure PDO brand integrity. Our analysis suggests that the diversity of technical choices and associated set of knowledge in Salers cheese production has paradoxically been both its strength and weakness. Local agricultural know-how forges links among participants in Salers networks, connecting cheese producers and consumers, to cattle, microbes, landscapes, wooden tools, and cheeses. Yet, diversity of local expertise creates a tension among producers who must collaborate to achieve unified standards within a PDO while resisting homogeneity. Such results contribute to discussing on PDO governance: an arena to share, compare, and unite local knowledge is critical for GI and thus for sustainable agricultural systems.","Salers protected designation of origin cheese, France.

"© (2016) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland. In the recent past, emerging regions of the world have become significant contributors in powering growth of the global economy. The regions have experienced increase in foreign direct investment, rise in volumes of exports and imports, and an increase in shipping lines towards such regions. Africa in this trend has not been left behind with the IMF reporting that six out of ten fastest growing economies in the world are found in Africa. Specifically, East Africa is one of the regions that have experienced this positive trend relating to more integration of the economies, high average GDP growth, and tremendous increase in international freight destined for overseas and inland through the ports of Mombasa and Dares Salaam. The rise in freight volume however, has resulted into port terminal capacity and productivity challenges, congestion along transport corridors, damage of highways, traffic jam in port cities and environmental pollution hence making the nature of growth and development expensive and unsustainable. This conceptual paper therefore tries to propose the adoption of the 'extended gateway concept 'to be integrated into East Africa's transportation-logistics system in order to manage and prevent supply chain related disruptions related to time,costs,reliability and safety .The paper presents a theoretical meaning of the concept, discusses the logistical challenges of East Africa from a shipping perspective, and proposes a 'Three tier' Extended gateway model for the region based on the development of inland intermodal terminals or dry ports to achieve a modern, economically and environmentally sustainable fright transportation system.",Integration of the extended gateway concept in Supply Chain disruptions Management in East Africa-Conceptual paper,disruptions *** East Africa *** Extended *** gateway *** management *** supply chain,international journal of engineering research in africa,84947969673,2016,,,,,,

As complex clusters of industrial activity and gateways for distribution networks, they are vulnerable to external and internal shocks disrupting supply chains. This evolution forces stakeholders to ponder on ""sustainable development,"" and to foster adaptive capabilities and create opportunities. The development and further substantiation of the notion of 'resilience' underlined the need to study how clusters and networks (should) respond to major disturbances. In this paper, we scrutinize the concept of port resilience by revisiting the Panarchy and adaptive cycle theorem of Holling (2001). The objective is to determine if this framework can be applied to a port development context. The paper outlines the literature on Panarchy and adaptive cycles and links it to ports. It also provides an overview of the general theorem and explains the value for maritime research.

"© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Stricter governmental regulations and rising public awareness of environmental issues are pressurising firms to make their supply chains greener. Partner selection is a critical activity in constructing a green supply chain because the environmental performance of the whole supply chain is significantly affected by all its constituents. The paper presents a model for green partner selection and supply chain construction by combining analytic network process (ANP) and multi-objective programming (MOP) methodologies. The model offers a new way of solving the green partner selection and supply chain construction problem both effectively and efficiently as it enables decision-makers to simultaneously minimize the negative environmental impact of the supply chain whilst maximizing its business performance. The paper also develops an additional decision-making tool in the form of the environmental difference, the business difference and the eco-efficiency ratio which quantify the trade-offs between environmental and business performance. The applicability and practicability of the model is demonstrated in an illustration of its use in the Chinese electrical appliance and equipment manufacturing industry.",An integrated model for green partner selection and supply chain construction,ANP *** Green supply chain *** Multi-objective programming *** Partner selection,journal of cleaner production,84953338702,2016,,,,,,
"© 2007-2012 IEEE. The recent financial crisis and other major crises have suggested that there are some strong interactions and interdependence between several supply chains and their external environments in various ways. A set of supply chains that are interdependent is called a holistic supply chain network (H-SCN) in this paper. There is a need to focus on building the resilience (in short, the ability of a system to recover from damage or disruption) of an entire H-SCN as it is believed that such a network system is strongly relevant to the recent economic recession that is triggered by financial crises. The objectives of this paper are to provide a classification of different SCNs in literature, leading to the identification of a new type of SCN system, i.e., an H-SCN, and to discuss the state of knowledge on the resilience of SCNs, particularly of an H-SCN. A systematic review approach is applied in this paper. Another contribution of this paper is the provision of a more comprehensive definition and description of resilient systems, including SCN systems. A final contribution of this paper is the proposal of the future directions of research on resilient SCN systems, particularly resilient H-SCN systems.","Toward a resilient holistic supply chain network system: Concept, review and future direction",Resilience *** supply chain network (SCN) *** systematic review,ieee systems journal,84909954091,2016,,,,,,

Environmental, social and economic concerns motivate the operation of closed-loop supply chain networks (CLSCN) in many industries. We propose a novel profit maximization model for CLSCN design as a mixed-integer linear program in which there is flexibility in covering the proportions of demand satisfied and returns collected based on the firm's policies. Our major contribution is to develop a novel hybrid robust-stochastic programming (HRSP) approach to simultaneously model two different types of uncertainties by including stochastic scenarios for transportation costs and polyhedral uncertainty sets for demands and returns. Transportation cost scenarios are generated using a Latin Hypercube Sampling method and scenario reduction is applied to consolidate them. An accelerated stochastic Benders decomposition algorithm is proposed for solving this model. To speed up the convergence of this algorithm, valid inequalities are introduced to improve the lower bound quality, and also a Pareto-optimal cut generation scheme is used to strengthen the Benders optimality cuts. Numerical studies are performed to verify our mathematical formulation and also demonstrate the benefits of the HRSP approach. The performance improvements achieved by the valid inequalities and Pareto-optimal cuts are demonstrated in randomly generated instances.",Hybrid robust and stochastic optimization for closed-loop supply chain network design using accelerated Benders decomposition,Benders decomposition *** Closed-loop supply chain *** Robust optimization *** Robustness and sensitivity analysis *** Stochastic programming,european journal of operational research,84948675984,2016,,,,,,
"© 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd. Nowadays, it has been observed an increasing awareness and understanding on the subject of sustainable companies and business models, addressing multi-disciplinary approaches that cover not only economical problems, but also social and environmental challenges. Supply chains and especially collaborative networks managers are increasingly aware of these sustainability issues, continuously seeking to meet current human needs while preserving environmental safety. Only this way, focusing on its sustainable growing, it is possible to preserve companies' steadiness. In order to achieve this goal, sustainable networks must ensure that each partner is fully aligned and committed with economic, environmental and social axes that rule the network operational behaviour. Nevertheless, in order to achieve this level of maturity within such complex and turbulent environments, organisations need to improve the quality of their performance assessment approaches, integrating the different sustainability perspectives. To accomplish this, it is critical to establish specific indicators responsible to formalise and evaluate partners' behaviour, according to well-identified objectives, as well as fuse this information in a comprehensive and user-friendly way.

First, a robust multi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming model is proposed to deal with ECLSC considering two conflicting objectives simultaneously, as well as the uncertain nature of the supply chain. Cost parameters of the supply chain and demand fluctuations are subject to uncertainty. The first objective function aims to minimize the economical cost and the second objective function is to minimize the environmental influence.

The fresh food industry is increasingly more interested in developing efficient and innovative solutions to guarantee quality and distribution sustainability; one of the main factors that influences such crucial aspects is packaging. This paper aims to perform a critical analysis of two existing packaging solutions, i.e. corrugated fibreboard boxes and re-usable plastic containers, from both the economic and the environmental perspective, to highlight the main weaknesses. It then proposes two alternative packaging solutions. The analysis features different economic assessments and models with different environmental impacts, taking into account the characteristics of packaging solutions predominantly within two supply chain types: the traditional food supply chain and the short food supply chain. The economic and environmental models are applied to understand the limitations of existing packaging solutions, to develop two alternative solutions and finally to perform an overall analysis of all fresh food containers, allowing the definition of the most suitable container for each of the proposed supply chain scenarios, from both an economic and environmental perspective. The innovative aspect of the research lies in the simultaneous evaluation of economic and environmental factors and the introduction of two new packaging solutions, making it of interest to researchers and fresh food industry professionals alike. This research analyzes two existing fresh food packaging solutions and develops two alternative packaging solutions able to overcome the current containers main limitations, mainly focusing on packaging sustainability.

In this paper, we study the effectiveness of military supply systems in complex and uncertain environment from the perspective of complex network topologies. Our goal is to provide insights on how to explore military supply networks and analyse the networks' resilience against different disruptions. We first propose an analysis process of the resilience for military supply networks. Then, we present two military supply growth models - key units priority (KUP) growth model and cost minimisation priority (CMP) growth model based on real military supply activities, which can be used to generate two military supply networks. We also present a new taxonomy of resilience metrics for military supply networks. Through computer simulation, we find that KUP supply network has poorer resilience against targeted disruptions but higher supply efficiency compared with other networks. While the connectivity of demand nodes in CMP supply network has better adaptability, it is of lower supply efficiency against both random and targeted disruptions.

"© 2015 Taylor and Francis. In this study, we examine the optimal allocation of demand across a set of suppliers in a supply chain that is exposed to supply risk and environmental risk. A two-stage mixed-integer programming model is used to develop a flexible sourcing strategy under disruptions. Our model integrates supplier selection and demand allocation with transportation channel selection and provides contingency plans to mitigate the negative impacts of disruptions and minimise total network costs. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the model and provide insights. The findings suggest that developing contingency plans using flexibility in suppliers production capacity is an effective strategy for firms to mitigate the severity of disruptions. We also show that flexibility and reliability of the suppliers and regions play a significant role in determining contingency plans for during disruption. Findings generally show that highly flexible suppliers receive less allocation, and their flexible capacity is reserved for disruptions. For firms that do not incorporate risk management into supplier selection and allocation, the recommendation is to source from fewer, more reliable suppliers with less risk of disruption. Our findings also emphasise that the type of disruption has important implications for supplier selection and demand allocation.

The link between green supply chain (GSC) and firm performance has been thoroughly studied, and it has been argued that firms are unlikely to perform well if they apply their capabilities in isolation. However, there is a lack of studies that identify the competitive determinants, the critical success factors, of GSC capabilities of firms, and the evaluation of GSC capabilities is predisposed to subjective and linguistic preferences. This study proposes to address the vague nature of qualitative measures using the fuzzy Delphi method to filter the measures and the fuzzy analytic network process to deal with the linguistic preferences in hierarchical structure of firms’ GSC capabilities. Data were collected from supply chain networks of electronic industry in Taiwan. This study presents empirical evidence of firms’ GSC capabilities, concluding that cost is the top competitive determinant and the environmental costs is the top priority of GSC capability.",Identifying the competitive determinants of firms’ green supply chain capabilities under uncertainty,Analytic network process *** Competitive determinants *** Fuzzy Delphi method *** Fuzzy set theory *** Green supply chain capabilities,clean technologies and environmental policy,84946887879,2016,,,,,,
"© 2016 Elsevier Ltd. The oil industry has been playing a particular role in the modern economy, acting globally in different countries within competitive business environments. Due to the complexity of the oil supply chain, the associated decision making process is a difficult task, which involves numerous elements from oil supply, going through oil refining, up to oil product distribution. Thus, decision-support tools are often required to assist the decision making in the context of the oil supply chain. The improvement of such decision-support tools is a continuous goal for corporations. From this background, this work aims to review the scientific production about the application of mathematical programming techniques to the distribution problems, faced by diverse entities in the downstream oil supply chain. The main objectives are to point out main contributions, besides identifying the major voids and new trends in order to establish an agenda for future research directions.",Downstream oil supply chain management: A critical review and future directions,Decision-support tool *** Distribution planning *** Downstream oil supply chain *** Mathematical programming technique *** Optimization method *** Refined product,computers and chemical engineering,84969557070,2016,,,,,,
"© 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. As the complexity and uncertainty of supply networks (SNs) increase, strategic management for resilient SNs becomes significant. An intelligent contingency plan, rather than a direct and constant back-up plan, is more suitable for flexible and effective management. In this research, we introduce a unique contingent multi-sourcing decision protocol for effective response when disruptions occur. It is called the Intelligent Contingent Sourcing (ICS) protocol. Unlike previous research, which has mostly considered the constant multi-sourcing1 among internal suppliers, our model is developed for contingent multi-sourcing by collaboration with external suppliers. (When both the supplier and buyer are managed/controlled by the same company, that supplier is considered an internal supplier; in case each supplier is independent in terms of buyers and is self-interested, such supplier is considered an external supplier). Such contingent multi-sourcing requires the theoretical analysis of each participant's economic aspect, because each external supplier is independent and thus self-interested. The ICS protocol forms a contingent collaborative coalition based on a distributed decision making process. To evaluate the performance of the ICS protocol, three sourcing models are compared: (1) Single sourcing, (2) Constant multi-sourcing, and (3) Contingent multi-sourcing by the ICS protocol. Statistical analysis reveals that, with statistical significance, the ICS protocol performs at least equal to or better than single sourcing, in terms of less lost sales and less total costs; ICS protocol also outperforms constant multi-sourcing under specific conditions (stated in the article).",Intelligent contingent multi-sourcing model for resilient supply networks,Coalition *** Collaboration *** Distributed decision making *** Sustainable supply networks,expert systems with applications,84955124831,2016,,,,,,
"© 2016 Elsevier Ltd Despite their inherent attractive characteristics, microalgae do not play a significant role in the green energy market because of high production cost. In order to propel this nascent industry one step further towards commercial viability, the present study expands the narrow outlook of previous studies which is restricted to a single location into a perspective with a nationwide network by proposing a sustainable supply chain model capable of revealing opportunities and limitations of algae industry's future. The proposed model is formulated based on batch and continuous production systems which completely cover the possible future configuration of microalgae-based biofuel supply chain and also offers managerial implications contributing to cost mitigation. Moreover, the uncertainty whose importance is accentuated in the case of algae production due to lack of real-world implementation is captured by the utilization of robust optimization under two norms of the uncertain data vector. A real case study is carried out to explore the applicability of the proposed model.

To provide support for decision maker to design a robust supply chain network under uncertain environment, with consideration of supply disruption caused by manufacturer's facility impairment or connecting link failure between nodes in the supply chain network, a nonlinear programming for designing the supply chain network was developed under stochastic demand and supply disruption. To overcome the difficulty of solving nonlinear programming, a piecewise linearization method was used to transform the nonlinear problem into a linear programming problem. Furthermore, the robust optimization model for supply chain network design under the uncertain disruption probability was formulated under both box and ellipsoid uncertain sets. Through linear programming and Lagrange dual theory, the proposed robust models were mathematically transformed into tractable linear programming and second-order cone ones respectively.

"© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. In a complex logistic environment it is critical to have efficient methods and tools to evaluate and improve the its efficiency. These tools must support the analysis with accurate results, but they must also be fast and easy enough to be used use in a complex practical setting. In this paper we present and discuss a deterministic single-period single-sourcing LP/MIP based method that the Linde Group has used for more than 100 projects for optimising the logistic network in the air-gas cylinder business. The model, called CSS (cylinder supply structure), includes a multi-echelon logistic network with transportation between plants and warehouses and distribution to several end-customers. The model allows deliveries to customers from all echelons in the supply network. Both the downstream flow of full cylinders and the upstream return of empty cylinders are included in the model. In general, more than 75 % of the total transportation- and distribution costs are caused by the final distribution to customers in a supply network as above. This paper will in particular analyse the distribution part of this model; how it is designed and how the cost is estimated. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the method we use empirical data to compare the model results with empirical results. The results showed that from the beginning the model overestimated the expected distances and costs for the distribution. With a rework and improved method to estimate the distribution cost, the model significantly improved its accuracy.","Estimating distribution costs in a supply chain network optimisation tool, a case study",Distribution cost *** Logistic network *** MIP model *** Supply chain network optimization,operational research,84944699132,2016,,,,,,
"© 2016 by the authors. Researchers and practitioners are taking more interest in developing sustainable garment supply chains in recent times. On the other hand, the supply chain manager drops sustainability objectives while coping with unexpected natural and man-made disruption risks. Hence, supply chain managers are now trying to develop sustainable supply chains that are simultaneously resilient enough to cope with disruption risks. Owing to the importance of the considered issue, this study proposed a network optimization model for a sustainable and resilient supply chain network by considering sustainability via embodied carbon footprints and carbon emissions and resilience by considering resilience index. In this paper, initially, a possibilistic fuzzy multi-objective sustainable and resilient supply chain network model is developed for the garment industry considering economic, sustainable, and resilience objectives. Secondly, a possibilistic fuzzy linguistic weight-based interactive solution method is proposed. Finally, a numerical case example is presented to show the applicability of the proposed model and solution methodology.",Sustainable and resilient garment supply chain network design with fuzzy multi-objectives under uncertainty,Disruption risks *** Multi-objective optimization *** Possibilistic fuzzy optimization *** Resilient supply chain *** Sustainable supply chain,sustainability (switzerland),84994831704,2016,,,,,,

"© 2016 American Chemical Society. Rare earth elements (REE) are elements that drive the development of new technologies in many sectors, including green energy. However, the supply chain of REE is subject to a complex set of technical, environmental, and geopolitical constraints. Some of these challenges may be circumvented if REE are recovered from naturally abundant alternative sources, such as saline waters and brines. Here, we synthesized and tested aminated silica gels, functionalized with REE-reactive ligands: diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic dianhydride (DTPADA), phosphonoacetic acid (PAA), and N,N-bisphosphono(methyl)glycine (BPG). A suite of characterization techniques and batch adsorption experiments were used to evaluate the properties of the functionalized silica adsorbents and test the REE-uptake chemistry of the adsorbents under environmentally relevant conditions. Results showed that BPG and DTPADA yielded the most REE-reactive adsorbents of those tested. Moreover, the DTPADA adsorbents demonstrated chemical and physical robustness as well as ease of regeneration. However, as in previous studies, amino-poly(carboxylic acid) adsorbents showed limited uptake at midrange pH and low-sorbate concentrations. This work highlighted the complexity of intermolecular interactions between even moderately sized reactive sites when developing high-capacity, high-selectivity adsorbents. Additional development is required to implement an REE recovery scheme using these materials; however, it is clear that BPG- and DTPADA-based adsorbents offer a highly reactive adsorbent warranting further study.",Effects of ligand chemistry and geometry on rare earth element partitioning from saline solutions to functionalized adsorbents,Adsorbents *** Ligands *** Rare earth elements *** Resource recovery *** Saline solution,acs sustainable chemistry and engineering,84994509487,2016,,,,,,
"© 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel resource availability assessment for supply chain (SC) configuration. This approach involves understanding both local resource availability and the demand-side implications of supplying global/regional markets as part of a more holistic SC design activity that incorporates local environmental factors. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed framework was derived from literature analysis, bridging relevant literature domains – natural capital theory, industrial ecology and SC configuration – in order to develop design rules for future resource-constrained industrial systems. In order to test the proposed framework, an exploratory case study, based on secondary data, was conducted. Findings: Research findings suggest that this approach might better identify relationships and vulnerabilities between natural resource availability and the viability of regional/global SCs. The research suggests that natural resource availability depends upon three elements – local resource consumption, global resource demand and external environmental factors. Research limitations/implications: The framework has two main limitations. The current work is focussed on a single industry case study used to exemplify the approach. Second, the framework does not consider other possible industries, which might enter or leave the specific location during the company’s operation. Furthermore, no assessment was made of the migration of populations within the area. Practical implications: For practitioners, such as those in the agri-food sector, the resource availability assessment framework informs SC configuration design. For policymakers, the research aims to provide policy guidelines, which can help to improve water-saving strategies for a particular region. At a broader societal level, the research raises awareness of resource scarcity amongst industrial players and the wider public. Originality/value: A resource availability assessment framework has been proposed, suggesting that the dynamics of both global and local resource demand, in conjunction with changing local environmental factors, can over time significantly deteriorate a firm’s natural resource impact on the local environment. Thus, the framework seeks to deliver mechanisms to evaluate potential vulnerabilities and solutions available to firms using a more proactive SC design method and to apply reconfiguration processes that account for natural resources, based primarily on network and resource attributes.",Local water stress impacts on global supply chains: Network configuration and natural capital perspectives,Global supply chains *** Local resource availability *** Natural capital theory *** Supply chain configuration,journal of advances in management research,85044176374,2016,,,,,,
"© 2016 Elsevier Ltd Biomass is a renewable resource that has attractive characteristics for energy production, but the corresponding supply chain could be subject of several uncertain factors that can affect drastically the optimal configuration, and those have not been properly accounted in previous publications. Therefore, this work presents a new approach for the optimal planning under uncertainty for a biomass conversion system involving simultaneously economic and environmental issues. The environmental impact was measured via the Eco-indicator99 method and the economic aspect was determined through the net annual profit. The proposed method considered the uncertainty involved in the raw material price by the stochastic generation of scenarios using the Latin Hypercube method followed by the implementation of the Monte-Carlo method, where a deterministic optimization problem was solved for each single scenario to select the structure of the more robust supply chain relying on statistical data. The proposed approach was applied to a case study for a distributed biorefinery system in Mexico. The results showed that the behavior of the profit values for the stochastic case is not associated to the behavior of the raw material price; also, it is possible to observe that the supply chain topology could be affected for the uncertainty in the raw material price; however, the environmental and economic objectives did not present significant changes.",Stochastic design of biorefinery supply chains considering economic and environmental objectives,Biofuels *** Biorefinery *** Optimization *** Supply chain *** Uncertainty,journal of cleaner production,84963944134,2016,,,,,,
"© 2016 American Chemical Society. The unbroken global refrigerated supply chain, or cold chain, is rapidly expanding in developing countries. In addition to increasing the energy intensity of the food system, the expanded cold chain may facilitate changes in the global diet, food waste patterns, food production and distribution, and shopping habits. The sustainability impacts of many of these changes chain are unknown, given the complexity of interacting social, economic, and technical factors. The current literature surrounding the environmental impacts of refrigeration in the food system focuses on the direct impacts of energy use and coolant emissions, and lacks a critical evaluation of the accompanying systemic societal changes that potentially carry greater environmental impacts. This review examines the cold chain as a transformative technology, identifying key intrinsic, indirect, and external factors that will favorably, unfavorably, or ambiguously impact the environmental profile of the food system. The review identifies key interactions and feedbacks between the cold chain, food production and consumption decisions, infrastructure development, and the global environment which are largely unexamined and in need of empirical data. Viewing cold chain expansion from this broader perspective is essential to understanding the changing impacts of the food system in developing countries and may inform future sustainability planning.",Critical research needed to examine the environmental impacts of expanded refrigeration on the food system, ,environmental science and technology,85021857386,2016,,,,,,
"© 2016 Chinese Institute of Industrial Engineers. This study considers an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) who produces a single kind of new product, and collects the end-of-use cores for remanufacturing in a closed-loop system. The decision problem facing the OEM is to determine the selling prices for both new and remanufactured versions of the same product, and the collection effort devoted to acquire the cores. Key features of the underlying problem include supply constrained from the reversed logistics and finite multi-period product life cycle, i.e. the product will be phased out after a finite number of periods in the market. This study formulates the problem using Lagrangian relaxation technique, and proposes an iterative search algorithm for solving the problem. Due to its complexity involved with high-dimensional matrix and dynamic nature, an adaptive search scheme is also developed using genetic algorithms. Numerical results reveal that the solutions generated by GAs are optimal in small-sized problems, e.g. in a two-period scenario, and are near optimal in median to large-sized problems, e.g. in a four-period scenario. Further analysis reveals that the decisions depend critically on the phases of product life cycle.",Pricing and collection effort decisions in a closed-loop supply chain,Closed-loop supply chain *** genetic algorithm *** return *** reversed logistic,journal of industrial and production engineering,84965072152,2016,,,,,,
"© 2016 Crown copyright. Fish and fisheries published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. Fisheries and aquaculture production, imports, exports and equitability of distribution determine the supply of aquatic food to people. Aquatic food security is achieved when a food supply is sufficient, safe, sustainable, shockproof and sound: sufficient, to meet needs and preferences of people; safe, to provide nutritional benefit while posing minimal health risks; sustainable, to provide food now and for future generations; shock-proof, to provide resilience to shocks in production systems and supply chains; and sound, to meet legal and ethical standards for welfare of animals, people and environment. Here, we present an integrated assessment of these elements of the aquatic food system in the United Kingdom, a system linked to dynamic global networks of producers, processors and markets. Our assessment addresses sufficiency of supply from aquaculture, fisheries and trade; safety of supply given biological, chemical and radiation hazards; social, economic and environmental sustainability of production systems and supply chains; system resilience to social, economic and environmental shocks; welfare of fish, people and environment; and the authenticity of food. Conventionally, these aspects of the food system are not assessed collectively, so information supporting our assessment is widely dispersed. Our assessment reveals trade-offs and challenges in the food system that are easily overlooked in sectoral analyses of fisheries, aquaculture, health, medicine, human and fish welfare, safety and environment. We highlight potential benefits of an integrated, systematic and ongoing process to assess security of the aquatic food system and to predict impacts of social, economic and environmental change on food supply and demand.","Aquatic food security: insights into challenges and solutions from an analysis of interactions between fisheries, aquaculture, food safety, human health, fish and human welfare, economy and environment",Ethics *** food safety *** food security *** food system *** health *** sustainability,fish and fisheries,84958787009,2016,,,,,,

The goal for the product platform is to share elements for common functions and to differentiate each product in the family by satisfying different requirements as much as possible. This study focuses on the product variety and short product life cycles that result from the increase and diversification in consumer needs and expectations. Proposed methodology aims to maximise the use of common product modules by considering platform-based derivative products and modular product design approaches to minimise the planning complexity in supply chain, manufacturing and service for derivative products. Functional and technical features of the products are determined in the first step. Then, design structure matrix is formed. After defining product components, similarity matrix for derivative products is formed. A clustering algorithm based on Clonal Selection is used to generate critical product modules.

"© Academy of Management Journal. The vertically integrated corporation of the 20th century has been replaced by disaggregated global supply chains across many industries. Dis-integration can reduce costs, but also limits the ability to monitor and control critical processes, including labor practices and the sourcing of supplies. This article asks: What organizational factors distinguish corporations that are able to vouch for their supply chains from those that are not? Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 gave companies over three years to determine and report on whether their products contained ""conflict minerals"" from the Democratic Republic of Congo area. Our analysis of every conflict minerals report submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission by over 1,300 corporations found that almost 80% admitted they were unable to determine the country of origin of such materials, and only 1% could certify themselves conflict-free with certainty beyond reasonable doubt. Internationally diversified firms and those with large and more dispersed supply chains were less likely to declare their products conflict-free: complexity reduces the visibility of a firm's supply chain. Our results suggest that widespread outsourcing may have reduced the corporate sector's capacity to account for the practices that yield its products.",Challenges for global supply chain sustainability: Evidence from conflict minerals reports, ,academy of management journal,85006946468,2016,,,,,,
"© 2016 The Authors Modern technology makes use of a variety of materials to allow for its proper functioning. To explore in detail the relationships connecting materials to the products that require them, we map supply chains for five product platforms (a cadmium telluride solar cell, a germanium solar cell, a turbine blade, a lead acid battery, and a hard drive (HD) magnet) using a data ontology that specifies the supply chain actors (nodes) and linkages (e.g., material exchange and contractual relationships) among them. We then propose a set of network indicators (product complexity, producer diversity, supply chain length, and potential bottlenecks) to assess the situation for each platform in the overall supply chain networks. Among the results of interest are the following: (1) the turbine blade displays a high product complexity, defined by the material linkages to the platform; (2) the germanium solar cell is produced by only a few manufacturers globally and requires more physical transformation steps than do the other project platforms; (3) including production quantity and sourcing countries in the assessment shows that a large portion of nodes of the supply chain of the hard-drive magnet are located in potentially unreliable countries. We conclude by discussing how the network analysis of supply chains could be combined with criticality and scenario analyses of abiotic raw materials to comprise a comprehensive picture of product platform risk.",Mapping supply chain risk by network analysis of product platforms,Metals criticality *** Product platforms *** Social network analysis *** Supply chain risk assessment *** Sustainable resource management,sustainable materials and technologies,84994026348,2016,,,,,,
"© 2016 Elsevier Ltd Purpose The transition from linear to circular product systems is a big step for any organization. This may require an organization to change the way it does business, designs product and manages supply chain. As these three areas are interdependent, bringing change in one area will influence the others, for instance, changing the business model from conventional sales to leasing will demand changes in both product design and the supply chain. At the same time, it is essential for an organization to anticipate the economic and environmental impact of all changes before it may decide to implement the circular product systems. However, there is no tool available today that can assess economic and environmental performance of circular product systems. The purpose of this research is to develop a multi-method simulation based tool that can help to evaluate economic and environmental performance of circular product systems. Method The conceptual models that are used to develop the tool have been formulated based on review of the state-of-the-art research. System Dynamics (SD) and Agent Based (AB) principles have been used to create the simulation model which has been implemented in Anylogic software platform.

"Delivery of products and services relies on well-managed operations. In designing large-scaled supply chain and service systems, locations of key facilities are a critical decision, as these facilities form the backbone of operations of these systems. For example, a key to effective supply chain management is the deployment of a structurally well-designed facility network, consisting of plants, warehouses, retail stores, etc. The aim of the study of facility location is to develop analytical methodologies to inform the planning decisions for evaluating and selecting siting plans for these facilities that ensure both convenient provision of (or access to) products and services by customers and users, as well as efficient operations (i.e., low operating costs). Facility location and network design has long been an integral topic of study in operations management. In this literature, one may observe that earlier works mainly focused on a strategic view of accessibility and operational costs, using performance metrics based on strategic distances between the chosen facilities and customers or suppliers. This traditional approach often neglects the impacts of future tactical and operational activities to be conducted in the network, and optimizes objectives that do not fully reflect the long-term performance of the facility network. In attempt to rectify this shortcoming, researchers have proposed an integrated modeling approach that enhances the classical models by jointly considering strategic, tactical and operational activities in facility systems. By integrating tactical and operational characteristics of facility networks into strategic design decisions, the integrated approach offers a more balanced perspective on the strategic trade-offs in network design. As shown in a series of recent research, this integrated modeling approach can potentially deliver new insights into facility location problems in a variety of contexts, e.g., supply chain network design, deployment of health care facilities, and design of storage systems for renewable power. In this monograph, we perform a review of some important concepts in this emerging stream of literature. Motivated by supply chain design applications, we first discuss the basic modeling concepts, including both mathematical programming-based and analytical approaches for modeling. While simulation-optimization approaches can be used for analyzing location problems, they are not covered in the scope of this monograph. We also review techniques adopted in the literature to analyze and solve these classes of location models. This is aimed to serve as a reference for readers (especially students) who like to develop their own models but are less familiar with this line of research. Furthermore, we review a number of applications of this line of research, covering both applications in supply chain contexts and other emerging domains, such as sustainable transportation, energy and health care.",Integrated modeling for location analysis, ,"foundations and trends in technology, information and operations management",84992389442,2016,,,,,,
"© 2016 Elsevier B.V. Supplier selection is an important strategic decision in the context of supply chain management. Existing literature on the subject of supplier selection is focused on evaluating primary (e.g., cost, quality, lead time) and green (e.g., CO2 emission, environmental practices) criteria. However, the concept of supplier resilience has recently emerged due to advent of competitive and global supply chains (and the operational and disruptive risks to which they are exposed). Several resilience-based supplier selection criteria are developed with respect to absorptive, adaptive, and restorative capacities. This paper further proposes a Bayesian network (BN), a paradigm that effectively models the causal relationships among variables but that has not been used in the context of supplier evaluation and selection, to quantify the appropriateness of suppliers across primary, green, and resilience criteria. Some benefits of the BN paradigm, including an ability to handle expert evidence and to perform sensitivity and propagation analyses, are demonstrated with an initial illustrative example of three suppliers.",A Bayesian network model for resilience-based supplier selection,Bayesian network *** Resilience *** Supplier selection,international journal of production economics,84978976106,2016,,,,,,
"© IMechE 2015. This article integrates the company operations decisions (i.e. location, production, inventory, distribution, and transportation) and finance decisions (i.e. cash, accounts payable and receivable, debt, securities, payment delays, and discounts) in which the demands and return rate are uncertain, defined by a set of scenarios. The cash flow and budgeting model will be coupled with supply chain network design using a mixed integer linear programming formulation. The article evaluates two financial criteria, that is, the change in equity and the profit as objective functions. The results indicate that objective functions are partially interdependent, that is, they conflict in certain parts. This fact illustrates the inadequacy of treating process operations and finances in isolated environments and pursuing objective myopic performance indicators such as profit or cost. Due to the importance of the supply chain network design problem, a multi-objective robust optimization with the max-min version is extended to cope with the uncertainty. A solution approach integrating Benders' decomposition method with the scenario relaxation algorithm is also proposed in this research. The improved algorithm has been applied to solve a number of numerical experiments. All results illustrate significant improvement in computation time of the improved algorithm over existing approaches. For a problem, the proposed algorithm shows a significant reduction in computational time compared with the Benders' decomposition and scenario relaxation that shows the efficiency of the proposed solution method.",Simultaneous optimization of operational and financial decisions to closed-loop supply chain network under uncertainty,Benders' decomposition *** Closed-loop network design *** financial aspect *** scenario relaxation algorithm *** uncertainty,"proceedings of the institution of mechanical engineers, part b: journal of engineering manufacture",84989846247,2016,,,,,,

Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore contextual barriers to supplier development for sustainability (SDS) in global supply chains and managerial remedies to mitigate such barriers. Design/methodology/approach – A dyadic case study design was adopted with a Western European buyer and six of its Chinese suppliers. The database consists of 41 interviews and 81 documents. Findings – Contextual barriers to SDS in global supply chains derive from complexities in the sustainability concept, socio-economic differences, spatial and linguistic distance, as well as cultural differences between buyers and suppliers. Partial remedies include effective joint communications, an open organizational culture, and the fostering of cross-contextual understanding. Research limitations/implications – The findings contribute to theory development at the intersection of sustainable and global supply chain management research. They help to explain why scarce sustainability-related progress in global supply chains has occurred in recent years. Practical implications – The identified barriers facilitate managerial decision making that will expedite SDS progress in global contexts. Social implications – By diffusing knowledge regarding available remedies, the study contributes to improving SDS effectiveness, thereby fostering sustainability capabilities and performance of suppliers.

"© Cambridge University Press 2016. Listeria monocytogenes has been the most common microbial cause of cheese-related recalls in both the United States and Canada in recent years. Since L. monocytogenes is inactivated by pasteurization, the majority of these cases have been linked to environmental and cross-contamination of fresh-soft, soft-ripened, and semi-soft cheeses. Cross-contamination of foods with L. monocytogenes is a continuous risk throughout the food supply chain and presents unique challenges for subsequent illness and outbreak investigations. Reports on outbreaks of listeriosis attributed to cross-contamination downstream from primary processing help highlight the critical role of epidemiological investigation coupled with coordinated molecular subtyping and surveillance in the recognition and investigation of complex foodborne outbreaks. Despite their complexity, environmental sampling throughout the supply chain coupled with improved genotyping approaches and concomitant analysis of foodborne illness epidemiological exposure data are needed to help resolve these and similar cases more rapidly and with greater confidence.",Listeria monocytogenes cross-contamination of cheese: Risk throughout the food supply chain, ,epidemiology and infection,84979295861,2016,,,,,,
"© 2016 Rolls-Royce plc. Abstract: The gas turbine has truly remarkable scope with respect to the range of stress, temperature and environmental conditions it can generate. As such, material limitations are seldom derived from a single or simple property and this resulting complexity makes business case decisions on new material development non-trivial. This is particularly true for ‘step change’ materials where a robust manufacturing supply chain/process route may not exist and the ability to utilise experience to bound validation and certification needs may be limited. This paper aims to highlight key issues associated with the limitations of existing materials and the nature of material selection to enable component weight reduction and /or temperature increase.

"© 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Products distribution and transportation is one of the largest sources of CO2 emission in supply chains. To date, a number of researchers have argued that intensive transportation activities through popular distribution strategies such as Just-In-Time (JIT) could significantly increase carbon emissions within logistics chains. However, a systematic understanding of how JIT distribution affects carbon emissions is still lacking in current literature. In this study, we develop a bi-objective optimization model for a carbon-capped JIT distribution of multiple products in a multi-period and multi-echelon distribution network. The aims are to jointly minimize total logistics cost and to minimize the maximum carbon quota allowed per period (carbon cap). The considered problem is investigated under three different carbon emission constraints namely periodic, cumulative and global. Since the studied problem is NP-Hard, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is developed and its parameters are tuned by Taguchi method. For further quality improvement of the developed solution approach, a novel local search approach called modified firefly algorithm incorporates NSGA-II. Different sizes of the problem are considered to compare the performances of the proposed hybrid NSGA-II and the classical one. Finally, the results are presented along with some policy and managerial insights. For policy makers, the findings show the impact of varying the carbon emission cap on total cost and total emissions under JIT distribution concept. From managerial perspectives, we analyze the relationships between average inventory holding and backlog level per period which can assist mangers to identify critical decisions for JIT distribution of products in carbon-capped environment.",Carbon-capped Distribution Planning: A JIT Perspective,Carbon emission constraint *** Firefly algorithm *** Green logistics *** Just-In-Time distribution *** NSGA-II *** Taguchi method,computers and industrial engineering,84965178908,2016,,,,,,
"© 2015 Institute for Supply Management, Inc. Supply disruptions are commonplace in today's global supply chain environment. The sheer magnitude of daily transactions makes it inevitable that there will be disruptions, further exacerbated by differences in cultural norms and attitudes that add a layer of complexity to managerial response. In this research, we examine the impact of national culture on individuals' responses to supply disruptions due to psychological contract breach. Using data from controlled experiments conducted with 158 subjects in China and 125 subjects in the U.S., we evaluate changes in decision-making behaviors and assessments of attitudinal outcomes regarding trust and repurchase intentions. Our results show post-breach behavioral differences based on national culture, but find that these differences are short-term in nature. Additionally, cultural differences show up in both of the attitudinal outcomes assessed in this research. Following a psychological contract breach, individuals from the U.S. express less trust in their supply chain partner and less willingness to work with that partner again in the future as compared to individuals from China. Our research suggests that managers and scholars interested in the cultural influences on the response to supply disruption will benefit from further research and understanding focusing on the intersection of psychological contract breach and cultural distance.",Supply Chain Psychological Contract Breach: An Experimental Study across National Cultures,behavioral supply management *** buyer/supplier relationships *** factor analysis *** human judgment and decision making *** laboratory study *** regression analysis,journal of supply chain management,84959422712,2016,,,,,,

"© 2016 Elsevier Ltd. The purpose of this paper is to explore themes and challenges in developing environmentally sustainable logistical activities. The approach is explorative with a cross sectional design that takes advantage of ten case studies out of selected logistics service providers (LSPs) operating primarily in the Scandinavian countries. The findings illustrate the major themes by analyzing current and future activities in developing environmentally sustainable logistical activities. In addition, four categories of challenges are identified: customer priorities, managerial complexity, network imbalance, and technological and legislative uncertainties. It is concluded that there is a great need for a holistic perspective where LSPs and product owners together analyze and design future logistical setups. The suggested holistic and integrative model, building on a three-dimensional concurrent engineering framework, provides new opportunities for research. Further research is needed to improve the interrelationship between LSPs and their customers in the development of sustainable logistical solutions.This paper puts forward recommendations for the sustainable development of logistics by combining the results from the case studies with a review of related literature.

"© 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Supply chain management plays a key role in optimizing manufacturing costs in competitive markets. In this paper, a multi period, multi product, multi echelon and capacitated supply chain problem for short lifetime products was solved using both exact method and metaheuristic algorithms. The considered echelons in a forward/reverse supply chain network design include suppliers, hybrid production-inspection centers, hybrid warehouse-collection centers, retailers, disposal centers and recovery centers. To tackle both strategic and tactical nature of the problem and due to its complexity, the location problem is first solved using an exact method in which strategic decisions are made aiming to minimize the location costs. Then the allocation problem is solved using both exact and metaheuristic algorithms, namely Tabu Search and Differential Evolution, in which based on the results obtained from the location problem, the profit is maximized and tactical decisions are made. A cyclic feedback procedure is proposed in between the location and allocation models to obtain the best solution. The allocation model is linearized using a new method and to handle the uncertainty, a robust mixed integer programming model is developed which can retain the linearity of the model. The computational results confirm the effectiveness of the exact method for the location problem while testifies the proposed algorithms can obtain effective solutions compared with that of the exact solutions for the allocation problem in both deterministic and uncertain environment. In addition, the results show that in terms of preciseness and convergence, the proposed Differential Evolution algorithm outperforms the other algorithm.",An integrated approach to solve a robust forward/reverse supply chain for short lifetime products,Differential Evolution algorithm *** Robust optimization *** Short lifetime products *** Supply chain management *** Tabu Search algorithm,computers and industrial engineering,84969595249,2016,,,,,,
"© 2016 by the authors. Over the last decades, the economic, social and environmental sustainability of the conventional agri-food system has and continues to be contested within both academic and public institutions. For small farms, the unsustainability of the food system is even more serious; farms' declining share of profit and the cost-price squeeze of commodity production has increased barriers to market access with the inevitable effect of agricultural abandonment. One way forward to respond to the existing conventional agri-food systems and to create a competitive or survival strategy for small family farms is the re-construction of regional and local agri-food systems, aligning with Kramer and Porter's concept of shared value strategy. Through a critical literature review, this paper presents ""regional and local food hubs"" as innovative organizational arrangements capable of bridging structural holes in the agri-food markets between small producers and the consumers-individuals and families as well as big buyers. Food hubs respond to a supply chain (or supply network) organizational strategy aiming at re-territorialising the agri-food systems through the construction of what in the economic literature are defined as values-based food supply chains.",Competitiveness of small farms and innovative food supply chains: The role of food hubs in creating sustainable regional and local food systems,Alternative agri-food networks *** Food hubs *** Food system sustainability *** Local food systems *** Nested market *** Short food supply chains *** Small farm competitiveness *** Values based food supply chains,sustainability (switzerland),84982694847,2016,,,,,,

"© 2016 The Franklin Institute. This paper studies the robust fault tolerant control problem of distributed network control systems (DNCSs). DNCSs are defined as the networked control systems (NCSs) consist of several sub-systems. Each sub-system contains its own sensor, controller and actuator. This kind of systems widely exist in the real world, such as the urban water supply network, smart grid and so on. Three main aspects of DNSCs are investigated in this paper. Firstly, we consider the variable structure problem of DNCSs. Meanwhile, the network problems including time delays, packet-dropouts and quantization errors are considered. Finally, the actuator fault tolerant control problem due to the possible poor working environment is also studied. A series of two-mode-dependent controllers are proposed to stabilize such DNCSs and meet the robust closed-loop performance. By using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) function, sufficient conditions on the existence of such controllers are presented in terms of bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs). A cone complementarity linearization (CCL) algorithm is given to solve proposed BMIs. Finally, a simulation example is exploited to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",Robust fault tolerant control of distributed networked control systems with variable structure,Distributed networked control systems *** Fault tolerant control *** Robust control *** Variable structure,journal of the franklin institute,84973165152,2016,,,,,,

Optimizing product design and the supply chain network at the same time brings substantial benefits. However, this approach involves decisions that can generate uncertainties in the long term. The challenge is to come up with a method that can adapt to most possible environments without straying too far from the optimal solution. Our approach is based on the generation of scenarios that correspond to combinations of uncertain parameters within the model. The performance of designs resulting from these scenario optimizations are compared to the performance of each of the other design scenarios, based on their probability of occurrence. The proposed methodology will allow practitioners to choose a suitable design, from the most profitable to the most reliable.",A method for a robust optimization of joint product and supply chain design,Mixed linear programming *** Product family *** Robust design *** Supply chain,journal of intelligent manufacturing,84897353024,2016,,,,,,

"© 2016 by the authors. Sustainability relies on the environmental, social and economical systems: the three pillars of sustainability. The social sustainability mostly advocates the people's welfare, health, safety, and quality of life. In the agricultural food industry, the aspects of social sustainability, such as consumer health and safety have gained substantial attention due to the frequent cases of food-borne diseases. The food-borne diseases due to the food degradation, chemical contamination and adulteration of food products pose a serious threat to the consumer's health, safety, and quality of life. To ensure the consumer's health and safety, it is essential to develop an efficient system which can address these critical social issues in the food distribution networks. This research proposes an ePedigree (electronic pedigree) traceability system based on the integration of RFID and sensor technology for real-time monitoring of the agricultural food to prevent the distribution of hazardous and adulterated food products. The different aspects regarding implementation of the proposed system in food chains are analyzed and a feasible integrated solution is proposed. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated and finally, a comprehensive analysis of the proposed ePedigree system's impact on the social sustainability in terms of consumer health and safety is presented.",EPedigree traceability system for the agricultural food supply chain to ensure consumer health,Agricultural food chain *** Electronic pedigree *** EPCglobal network *** Food quality *** Food safety *** Performance analysis *** RFID *** Sensors *** Social sustainability,sustainability (switzerland),84990997300,2016,,,,,,
"© 2016 This study aims to design a multi-echelon, multi-objective supply chain model that incorporates new product development and its effects on supply chain configuration. To survive in a highly competitive industry, strategies to either collaborate or compete with rival firms within a network should be considered in the new product development process, and it is crucial to pay great attention to customers’ needs and interests. Considering the imprecise nature of some critical parameters plays an important role in making suitable strategic decisions. This fact requires considering uncertainties of the environment such as customer demands and supplier capacities. In this study, a supply chain involving multiple suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and customers and addressing a multi-objective, multi-period and multi-product aggregate procurement and production planning problem is considered. The first objective function aims to maximize the profit of the supply chain, including that associated with new product development. The second objective function considers customer satisfaction, and the third one maximizes the production of the developed and new products. To address real-world planning problems involving noisy, incomplete or erroneous data, the supplier capacity parameters of the supply chain and demand fluctuations are subject to uncertainty, which is modeled by fuzzy stochastic programming. Finally, the proposed multi-objective model is solved as a single-objective mixed integer programming model by applying the revised multi-choice goal programming method. In addition, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model.",A fuzzy stochastic multi-objective optimization model to configure a supply chain considering new product development,Fuzzy stochastic linear programming *** New product development *** Revised multi-choice goal programming *** Supply chain,applied mathematical modelling,84962779516,2016,,,,,,

In order to tackle the uncertain environment in these two problems, we propose an integrated mathematical programming model based on robust optimization theory. The framework of the proposed supply chain network involves a forward flow from heterogeneous capacitated suppliers offering price discounts to customers, and also a reverse flow from customer zones to disposal centers or production facilities. The objective function of the model is to minimize the total cost of the supply chain network by determining a set of best suppliers, order allocation to selected suppliers, the location of facilities in each layer and transportation quantities between them. Moreover, to measure the imprecise input parameters, according to three types of uncertainty sets, the robust counterparts of the model have been developed. Finally, to validate the robust model, the eventual optimal solutions are compared with the deterministic model, and numerical studies have been implemented along with sensitivity analysis.",An integrated supply chain configuration model and procurement management under uncertainty: A set-based robust optimization methodology,Closed-loop supply chain *** Robust optimization *** Supplier selection *** Uncertainty set,applied mathematical modelling,84967190307,2016,,,,,,

Supply Chain (SC) is the effective coordination and integration of all activities performed by several business lines and their infrastructures; such as raw material suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers till delivering the products to the customer. The supply chain facilities location is an important issue which is needed to be solved as it is one of the important pillars in the supply chain design model. Therefore, it is critical for supply chain managing teams and designers to adopt the latest scientific and most effective methods to locate a facility by carrying different scenarios and trade-offs assessment, the used tools are only a decision supporting tools. This paper concentrates on the development status of a decision-support tool for solving supply chain design including location problem of various facilities, using the MILP mixed integer linear problem solving programming model by constructing a generic analytical algorithm to solve this problem. EXECL SOLVER TOOL, MATLAB SOFTWARE with a GUI (graphical user input interface) programmed by the C# (C SHARP) programming software are used. In the MILP programming model iterative algorithm methods are used, where every iteration would generate a whole different new set of solutions to match some constrains, conditions and service levels added by the programmer. The first solution only matches some previous added criteria, resulting in a new set of solutions in the iteration, until finally an optimal solution rises under dynamic environment. In this paper, a typical three layers medium term planning mixed integer linear Programme MILP model for supply chain design is presented and applied for chemicals and biofuel production from rice straw biomass.

"The inclusion of economical, environmental, and societal issues in all stages of doing business helps to bring about sustainable development. A business begins or expands by establishing new facilities, so selecting a facility location is a strategic and crucial decision. In the context of sustainability, the selection of location for different facilities can be a critical problem, especially for manufacturing firms that endorse the wide footprint of Extended Producer Responsibility policies. This study aims at prioritizing alternative potential locations for manufacturing firms with respect to the three dimensions of sustainability identified above. The three dimensions are assessed by factors obtained through a factor analysis and are grouped by corresponding invariable sub criteria. These sub criteria are chosen from the extant literature review. Then, the preferred order of alternative potential location is obtained by Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) based on each location's overall performance. The performance of each alternative potential location is assessed on the basis of overall weights of alternatives, evaluating factors, and triple bottom line attributes, which were obtained by Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). The multi criteria decision making technique, AHP, calculates the weights of the qualitative and quantitative criteria impacting the location selection problem. Then the approach of the study is validated by applying a case from real life; the results are justified by completing a sensitivity analysis on the relative importance weights of the three primary attributes (economical, environmental, and social). The results of the sensitivity analysis demonstrate an effective decision making technique for the optimal selection of sustainable manufacturing locations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Location selection is a multi dimensional issue which requires consideration of quantitative and qualitative evaluation criteria. Some of these criteria may have imprecise and uncertain data which make the location selection decision hard to progress. Although many multi attribute decision making (MADM) techniques are utilized in location decision study field, there is a lack of studies which provide solutions by considering high number of supply chain uncertainties. In this study, against the drawbacks of traditional MADM techniques, a novel MADM approach is applied for location decision under high uncertainty as a first time. In the proposed model, a new notion named as cloud based design optimization (CBDO) is utilized because CBDO can take into consideration certain and uncertain factors simultaneously. Furthermore, it provides robust solution within worst case scenario to existing approaches by mediating between aspects of fuzzy set theory and probability distributions. Robustness enables decision makers have managerial and operational foresights about possible unexpected situations, and take necessary actions against risk. An illustrative example is conducted in warehouse location selection problem area to indicate the performance of the proposed approach. It is revealed out that location decision is very sensitive to the consideration of uncertainty and CBDO can be a helpful supportive tool for decision makers in providing solution under high uncertainty.

"The term 'synchronization' in manufacturing refers to the provision of the right components to the subsequent production steps at the right moment in time. It is widely assumed that synchronization is beneficial to the logistics performance of manufacturing systems. However, it has been shown that synchronization phenomena can be detrimental to systems in which they emerge. To study if synchronization phenomena also occur in and affect manufacturing systems' performance, a formal quantification and holistic understanding of the types of synchronization phenomena emerging in manufacturing are needed. This article aims to fill this research gap by developing synchronization measures for manufacturing systems, applying these measures to real-world production feedback data and utilising them to test the assumption about synchronization's beneficial effect on logistics performance. We identify two distinct synchronization types occurring in manufacturing systems, logistics and physics synchronization, and show that they are negatively correlated. Further, we show that logistics synchronization and due date performance exhibit anti-correlation and thus question the assumption that synchronization leads to higher efficiency in manufacturing systems.

Supply chain sustainability is a critical and timely topic for the developing country like India that captures increasing concerns over sustainability, whether driven by current legislation, public interest or competitive opportunity. Identification of CSFs responsible for sustainable supply chain practices and evaluating their contextual relationships has the potential to affect future government policy, current production operations and identify new business models. In response to this, this paper intends to identify CSFs based on organisational theory and model them to implement sustainable supply chain practices in Indian automobile industry. Twenty-five CSFs to implement sustainable supply chain practices based on organisational theory are recognised by means of the literature review and in discussions with experts in one case study organisation. A solution methodology based on the interpretive structural modelling (ISM) technique is used to propose a structural model, which not only helps in understanding the contextual relationship among these CSFs, but also in determining their interdependence to implement sustainable supply chain practices. Further, the importance of CSFs has been determined based on their driving and dependence power using MICMAC analysis. Our overarching thesis is that the insights gained are useful for Indian automobile industry and would help practitioners, regulators and academicians to focus their efforts towards implementation of sustainable supply chain practices.",Analysing critical success factors to implement sustainable supply chain practices in Indian automobile industry: a case study,Sustainability *** supply chain *** critical success factors (CSFs) *** automobile industry *** India,production planning & control,WOS:000381058000005,2016,,,,,,
"Sustainable transport commonly considers either the interaction between built and natural environments or the interface between transportation and interdependent critical infrastructure. Although considering each of these key dimensions is a crucial task for achieving sustainable transport, the dimensions are infrequently considered together. When an integrated network design framework is proposed, two important issues are taken into account: (a) the aftermath of potential severe weather episodes on metropolitan-area infrastructure and (b) the existing interdependencies across transportation and fuel supply chain networks. Then the response of infrastructure in the face of flooding hazards is investigated. Framed within a multistage linear stochastic program, the proposed model seeks to find fueling station deployment that provides the transportation network with optimum random functionality when the network is stressed or under attack. A set of numerical experiments illustrates how changes to enhancement strategies at different stages of government affect the optimal investments in resilient design.",Flood-Resilient Deployment of Fueling Stations: Extension of Facility Location Problem, ,transportation research record,WOS:000379797000011,2016,,,,,,
"Complexity and dynamism are considered intrinsic features of engineer-to-order (ETO) business environment; it is, therefore, important to understand and manage them better. Based on empirical investigation into two case companies, this paper expands the existing literature on how and why complexity and dynamism context factors constitute not only external business environment issues but also subfactors within the boundary of the firm. It argues that most of the subfactors for complexity and dynamism identified for repetitive manufacturing are relevant for the high uncertainty capital goods manufacturing ETO with some exceptions such as short product life cycle and technological turbulence. A framework of configuration (on implementation of lean practices), and moderation (on the lean-operations performance relation) forms of influence from dynamism and complexity is proposed. Further arguments to be verified in future large-scale research include: (1) dynamism bears challenges, and complexity provides opportunities to foster implementation of relevant lean practices in ETO, (2) both complexity and dynamism positively mediate better operations performance and enriched value from implemented lean practices.",Understanding dynamism and complexity factors in engineer-to-order and their influence on lean implementation strategy,Lean *** engineer-to-order *** dynamism *** complexity *** uncertainty *** case study,production planning & control,WOS:000374632200001,2016,,,,,,
"Social systems in mountain regions are exposed to a number of disturbances, such as climate change. Calls for conceptual and practical approaches on how to address climate change have been taken up in the literature. The resilience concept as a comprehensive theory-driven approach to address climate change has only recently increased in importance. Limited research has been undertaken concerning tourism and resilience from a network governance point of view. We analyze tourism supply chain networks with regard to resilience to climate change at the municipal governance scale of three Alpine villages. We compare these with a planned destination management organization (DMO) as a governance entity of the same three municipalities on the regional scale. Network measures are analyzed via a quantitative social network analysis (SNA) focusing on resilience from a tourism governance point of view. Results indicate higher resilience of the regional DMO because of a more flexible and diverse governance structure, more centralized steering of fast collective action, and improved innovative capacity, because of higher modularity and better core- periphery integration. Interpretations of quantitative results have been qualitatively validated by interviews and a workshop. We conclude that adaptation of tourism-dependent municipalities to gradual climate change should be dealt with at a regional governance scale and adaptation to sudden changes at a municipal scale. Overall, DMO building at a regional scale may enhance the resilience of tourism destinations, if the municipalities are well integrated.",Resilience to climate change in a cross-scale tourism governance context: a combined quantitative-qualitative network analysis,adaptation *** climate change *** core-periphery integration *** social network analysis *** stakeholder perceptions *** tourism destination *** transformation,ecology and society,WOS:000373935100033,2016,,,,,,
"CAP Group is a public company, supplying the municipalities within the provinces of Milan and Monza/Brianza (Northern Italy) with the integrated water service: 197 municipalities and more than 2 million users served, 887 wells, 154 wall-mounted tanks and hubs, a water supply network of over 7500 km, from which approximately 250 million cubic metres of water per year are withdrawn. The drinking water supply comes exclusively from groundwater resources, circulating in several overlapping aquifer systems. Basin-scale water resource management, as required by the European Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC), is an extremely complex task. In view of this backdrop, CAP is currently developing a project called Infrastructural Aqueduct Plan that relies on a Decision Support System approach. The paper describes the preliminary steps concerning the design of a prototype Decision Support System aiming at the management of groundwater resources on a basin scale (Ticino and Adda rivers area). CAP Group Decision Support System is intended to be a package allowing for water resource assessment, identification of boundary conditions, climatic driving forces and demographic pressures, simulation and investigation of future forecasts and comparison of alternative policy measures. The project has been designed in steps including Geodatabase building, geographic information system (GIS) analysis (including multilayer analysis) and numerical modelling. The data collected in the geodatabase were analyzed to design GIS quantitative and qualitative thematic maps in order to perform the multilayer analysis of current and future state and impacts, for providing the decision maker with a comprehensive picture of the water system. The multilayer analysis relies on specific indicators based on some quantitative and qualitative data: hydrogeological, chemical, isotopic, soil use and hazards, climatic and demographic. Each parameter belonging to these macro areas were classified by 7-criticality classes scale and weights were assigned to each of them. For each macro area a synthetic index was calculated by multiplying class values with weights. These synthetic indexes were managed with a multilayer approach and compared with other models and tools (e.g. geological model, numerical groundwater model, distribution network model) in order to obtain criticality indexes. The assessment of these criticality indexes allow to evaluate alternative and strategic solutions to achieve a more efficient and sustainable water system management using a best choice approach. Currently the project team is working on multilayer analysis. The next task will be the implementation of groundwater numerical model.","Basin-scale hydrogeological, geophysical, geochemical and isotopic characterization: an essential tool for building a Decision Support System for the sustainable management of alluvial aquifer systems within the provinces of Milan and Monza-Brianza (Northern Italy)",Po Plain *** Geographic Information System *** Decision Support System *** Hydrochemistry *** Groundwater management,acque sotterranee-italian journal of groundwater,WOS:000445671300004,2016,,,,,,
"Developing environmental performance of suppliers is critical for green supply chain management. Organizations are nowadays investing in various green supplier development programs to enhance their supplier performances. The decision to select the right program for green supplier development is often a challenging decision due to lack of prior experience, limited quantitative information, specific context of the organization, and varying supplier backgrounds. This paper addresses the problem of evaluating green supplier development programs and proposes a fuzzy NGT (Nominal Group Technique)-VIKOR (VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje) based solution approach. NGT is used to identify criteria for evaluating green supplier development programs. Fuzzy theory is used to address qualitative (linguistic) ratings for the alternatives and the selected criteria used under lack of quantitative information. VIKOR is used to generate green supplier development program rankings and recommend the best program(s) for implementation. Sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the influence of modeling parameters on ranking results of alternatives. A numerical application is provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Companies have reacted to the apparent opportunities and threats of globalization through various global production practices that have increased supply chain complexity and various forms of risk. Through increasing supply chain integration, companies have attempted to manage this increased level of complexity. Supply chain integration has been identified as a key practice to manage supply chains and achieve superior performance. The intent of this paper is to explore the role of risk and risk management practices in the success of supply chain integration in terms of their impact on cost and innovation performance. By applying the relational view and through cross-country survey and secondary country data we explore differences in supply chain integration efficacy based on the risk of conducting business (measured in terms of the strength of a country's rule of law) and the mitigating effect of supply chain risk management practices. One of the main conclusions suggests that supplier integration is also effective in weak rule of law (i.e., high risk) environments. Furthermore, companies can complement and strengthen the performance impact of their supplier integration practices through supply chain risk management practices in risky environments.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to extend the concept of agility in humanitarian logistics beyond emergency operations. Since the humanitarian logistics literature focuses primarily on emergencies and sees longer term and regular operations as being conducted in relatively stable and predictable environments, agile practices are usually not associated with humanitarian protracted operations. Therefore, this paper explores the logistics and supply chain environment in such operations in order to identify their basic features and determine if agility is an important requirement. Design/methodology/approach - Using a case study of the United Nations World Food Programme, the authors collected and analysed qualitative and quantitative data on the characteristics of protracted operations, the risks and uncertainties most frequently encountered, their impact, and the ways that field logisticians manage contingencies. Findings - The research demonstrates that unpredictability and disruptions exist in protracted operations. Therefore, short-term operational adjustments and agile practices are needed in order to support the continuity of humanitarian deliveries. Research limitations/implications - Future research should focus on a wider range of humanitarian organisations and move from a descriptive to a prescriptive approach in order to inform practice. Notwithstanding these limitations, the study highlights the need for academics to broaden the scope of their research beyond emergencies and to address the specific needs of humanitarian organisations involved in longer term operations. Originality/value - This paper is the first empirical research focusing exclusively on the logistics features of humanitarian protracted operations. It provides a more concrete and complete understanding of these operations.",Supply chain agility in humanitarian protracted operations,Risk management *** Disaster recovery *** Agility *** Humanitarian logistics *** Humanitarian supply chain *** Protracted operations,journal of humanitarian logistics and supply chain management,WOS:000381906000003,2016,,,,,,
"With the constantly increasing pressure of the competitive environment, supply chain (SC) decision makers are forced to consider several aspects of business climate. More specifically, they should take into account the endogenous features (e.g., available means of transportation, and the variety of products) and exogenous criteria (e.g., the environmental uncertainty, and transportation system conditions). In this paper, a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for dynamic design of a supply chain network is proposed. In this model, multiple products and multiple transportation modes, the time value of money, traffic congestion, and both supply-side and demand-side uncertainties are considered. Due to the complexity of such models, conventional solution methods are not applicable; therefore, two hybrid Electromagnetism-Like Algorithms (EMA) are designed and discussed for tackling the problem. The numerical results show the applicability of the proposed model and the capabilities of the solution approaches to the MINLP problem.",Hybrid Electromagnetism-Like Algorithm for Dynamic Supply Chain Network Design under Traffic Congestion and Uncertainty, ,mathematical problems in engineering,WOS:000369651400001,2016,,,,,,
"This study presents a novel approach to design and evaluate 'last-mile' solutions - encompassing the social and economic perspectives of key stakeholders. While urban system initiatives have been implemented in practice, theoretical gaps remain at the operational design level. A theoretical framework is developed, based on design criteria identified from a critical synthesis of supply chain and operations management literature, and 'operationalised' using an in-depth case study demonstrating implementation of a Consumer Choice Portal-Package Consolidation Centre solution, within a densely populated urban geography. Findings suggest that there is a need to re-define the role of institutional actors beyond that of the traditional governance task, to one of being able to facilitate performance outcomes. Similarly, industrial efficiency dimensions need to be reorientated to include consumer participation, social considerations and multi-stakeholder service outcomes. Finally, implications for operations theory and practising managers in city logistics are highlighted, with suggested directions for future research.",Identifying design criteria for urban system 'last-mile' solutions - a multi-stakeholder perspective,'Last-mile' operations *** urban systems *** smart cities *** evaluation criteria *** stakeholder analysis *** service supply networks design,production planning & control,WOS:000374632300004,2016,,,,,,
"© 2016 KEDGE Business School. The monitoring of supply chains (SCs) is a major challenge due to the increasing complexity of the global market, which increases the exposure of monitoring systems to disruptions, caused by technological innovations and consumer needs. Thus, a dynamic behaviour model to incorporate demand uncertainty in the SC of a Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) was designed in the present study. In our system, information uncertainty is modelled in a fuzzy manner based on Belief, Desire and Intention (BDI) architecture. To achieve our objective, we enhance the multi-agent knowledge model of the SC. Our contribution includes the development of a monitoring system. We first propose a dynamic reasoning model of fuzzy BDI agents faced with an uncertain situation. We then describe the collaborative behaviour between the agents of the SMEs. The challenge addressed in this study is how to make beneficial decisions given uncertain information.",Fuzzy BDI agents for supply chain monitoring in an uncertain environment,BDI agents *** Fuzzy logic *** Monitoring *** SME clusters *** Supply chain *** Uncertain environment,supply chain forum,85045908283,2016,,,,,,
"Industries face significant pressures to enact eco-friendly practices in their supply chain due to the constraints of natural resources and growing ecological awareness among customers. Reverse logistics (RL) has been considered as a systematic approach for industries to improve their environmental impacts and to ensure sustainability in business. Industries are enthusiastic to adopt RL activities in their businesses, but they also face challenges such as insufficient knowledge and resources regarding RL implementation. Therefore, we seek to evaluate the critical success factors (CSFs) linked to the implementation of RL in manufacturing industries in India. In this work, a structural model is proposed by using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methods to evaluate the CSFs in RL adoption. The AHP methodology assists in establishing the priorities of the CSFs, while the DEMATEL approach categorizes the causal relationships among them. The findings of this work shows that the Global competitiveness main factor is highly prioritized, and thus, needs to be focused greatly in order to increase the effectiveness of RL adoption in business. The relative priority of the remaining main factors through AHP analysis is given as Regulatory factors- HR and organizational factors-Economic factors- Strategic factors. The findings also indicate that Global competitiveness; Regulatory; HR and organizational main factors are classified under cause group, while Economic and Strategic main factors belong to effect group. This model will help business analysts and supply chain managers formulate both short-term and long-term, flexible decision strategies for successfully managing and implementing RL adoption in the supply chain scenarios.

"This paper aims to design a robust waste cooking oil- (WCO-) for-biodiesel supply chain under WCO supply and price as well as biodiesel demand and price uncertainties, so as to improve biorefineries' ability to cope with the poor environment. A regional supply chain is firstly introduced based on the biggest WCO-for-biodiesel company in Changzhou, Jiangsu province, and it comprises three components: WCO supplier, biorefinery, and demand zone. And then a robust mixed integer linear model with multiple objectives (economic, environmental, and social objectives) is proposed for both biorefinery location and transportation plans. After that, a heuristic algorithm based on genetic algorithm is proposed to solve this model. Finally, the 27 cities in Yangtze River delta are adopted to verify the proposed models and methods, and the sustainability and robustness of biodiesel supply are discussed.",Robust Optimization on Regional WCO-for-Biodiesel Supply Chain under Supply and Demand Uncertainties, ,scientific programming,WOS:000380688400001,2016,,,,,,
"Determining the relevance and importance of a technosphere process or a cluster of processes in relation to the rest of the industrial network can provide insights into the sustainability of supply chains: those that need to be optimized or controlled/safeguarded. Network analysis (NA) can offer a broad framework of indicators to tackle this problem. In this article, we present a detailed analysis of a life cycle inventory (LCI) model from an NA perspective. Specifically, the network is represented as a directed graph and the emergy numeraire is used as the weight associated with the arcs of the network. The case study of a technological system for drinking water production is presented. We investigate the topological and structural characteristics of the network representation of this system and compare properties of its weighted and unweighted network, as well as the importance of nodes (i.e., life cycle unit processes). By identifying a number of advantages and limitations linked to the modeling complexity of such emergy-LCI networks, we classify the LCI technosphere network of our case study as a complex network belonging to the scale-free network family. The salient feature of this network family is represented by the presence of hubs: nodes that connect with many other nodes. Hub failures may imply relevant changes, decreases, or even breaks in the connectedness with other smaller hubs and nodes of the network. Hence, by identifying node centralities, we can rank and interpret the relevance of each node for its special role in the life cycle network.",On the Complexity of Life Cycle Inventory Networks Role of Life Cycle Processes with Network Analysis,complexity *** drinking water *** emergy *** industrial ecology *** life cycle assessment (LCA) *** network analysis,journal of industrial ecology,WOS:000387326900010,2016,,,,,,
"In recent years, numerous articles have addressed management strategies aimed at assisting forests to adapt to climate change. However, these seldom take into account the practical and economic implications of implementing these strategies, notably, supply of forest plants and seed. Using semi-structured interviews with practitioners involved in the plant and seed supply chain in Great Britain, we highlight a series of practical and economic bottlenecks commonly encountered in the supply of locally sourced seed and domestically produced planting stock for native woodland and hedging markets. We find that adoption of alternative seed sourcing strategies, designed specifically to account for directional climate warming, is likely to exacerbate existing problems by adding further complexity to decisions nurseries make about tree species and seed origins to produce. The lack of long-term market predictability brought about by the current configuration of forestry grants and regulations and, in particular, the administrative systems for processing grant applications is identified as a major impediment to having a sustainable and competitive supply of home-grown and currently adapted planting stock. Finally, the time and effort it takes to supply healthy plants for native woodland creation projects deserves much wider recognition throughout the industry and will be crucial if planting objectives are to be met sustainably.

"Analyzing carbon emissions is critical for successfully managing sustainable production and consumption. In a dual channel supply chain that includes traditional retailers and online e-tailers, consumer free riding often occurs when consumers enjoy the services provided by a traditional retailer but make purchases at a lower price from an e-tailer. The specific aim of this paper, therefore, is to evaluate the impact of consumer free riding on carbon emissions in a product's life cycle across a dual channel closed loop supply chain and to assess the effect of governmental e-commerce tax on carbon emissions. The study comprises a systematic comparison and numerical analysis of cases in which consumers do or do not free ride. Our results show that although manufacturers may gain economic benefits from consumer free riding behavior, total carbon emissions across the supply chain increase too, and a governmental tax on e-commerce can help reduce consumer free riding and total carbon emissions. Our research also suggests that, a government may have to subsidize the e-tailer in the consideration of maximizing the social welfare. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"© 2016 by the authors. The majority of restoration strategies in the wake of large-scale disasters have focused on short-term emergency response solutions. Few consider medium- to long-term restoration strategies to reconnect urban areas to national supply chain interdependent critical infrastructure systems (SCICI). These SCICI promote the effective flow of goods, services, and information vital to the economic vitality of an urban environment. To re-establish the connectivity that has been broken during a disaster between the different SCICI, relationships between these systems must be identified, formulated, and added to a common framework to form a system-level restoration plan. To accomplish this goal, a considerable collection of SCICI data is necessary. The aim of this paper is to review what data are required for model construction, the accessibility of these data, and their integration with each other. While a review of publically available data reveals a dearth of real-time data to assist modeling long-term recovery following an extreme event, a significant amount of static data does exist and these data can be used to model the complex interdependencies needed. For the sake of illustration, a particular SCICI (transportation) is used to highlight the challenges of determining the interdependencies and creating models capable of describing the complexity of an urban environment with the data publically available. Integration of such data as is derived from public domain sources is readily achieved in a geospatial environment, after all geospatial infrastructure data are the most abundant data source and while significant quantities of data can be acquired through public sources, a significant effort is still required to gather, develop, and integrate these data from multiple sources to build a complete model. Therefore, while continued availability of high quality, public information is essential for modeling efforts in academic as well as government communities, a more streamlined approach to a real-time acquisition and integration of these data is essential.",Post-disaster supply chain interdependent critical infrastructure system restoration: A review of data necessary and available for modeling,Critical Infrastructure *** Extreme Events *** GIS *** Logistics Network *** Urban Supply Chain,data science journal,84975824100,2016,,,,,,
"© 2016, © Korea Trade and Research Association. Purpose: In a changing trade landscape, global trade transaction relies on a global supply-chain network. Customs clearance to cross borders is critical to enhancing the competitiveness of both importers and exporters. As such, each country has adopted an authorized economic operator (AEO) program to promote the security of both imported and exported cargo as well as expedite freight movements. The purpose of this paper is to discover the factors which should be taken into account to utilize an AEO program, and to look at the causal relations between these factors. Design/methodology/approach: This study conducted a survey on 201 AEO programs in Korea. With partial least squares, the structure model is tested using the coefficient value of the determination of the dependent variable, explained by the sign and scale of the path coefficient, statistical significance, and leading variable. Moreover, this study performed bootstrap re-sampling to verify all paths and significance. Findings: It was found that AEO external pressure, training capacity, and sustainability are shown to have a significant impact on AEO performance. Furthermore, for the group with a high level of AEO application, training capacity and AEO sustainability are shown to have a greater effect on AEO performance. For the group with a low level of AEO application, internal regulation is shown to have a bigger impact on AEO performance. Originality/value: This study sets itself apart from previous ones in that it examines AEO application for trade security and facilitation with regard to customs, which would affect global supply-chain management.",Impact of application factors of the AEO program on its performance,Application of authorized economic operator program *** Authorized economic operator program *** External pressure *** Internal regulation *** Partnerships *** Sustainability *** Training capacity,journal of korea trade,85015259251,2016,,,,,,

"© 2016. The Authors. External Quality Assessment (EQA) surveys performed by the World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa (WHO AFRO) revealed the need for the strengthening of public health microbiology laboratories, particularly for testing of epidemic-prone diseases in the African Region. These surveys revealed common issues such as supply chain management, skilled personnel, logistical support and overall lack of quality standards. For sustainable improvements to health systems as well as global health security, deficiencies identified need to be actively corrected through robust quality assurance programmes and implementation of laboratory quality management systems. Given all the pathogens of public health importance, an external quality assessment programme with a focus on vaccine-preventable diseases and emerging and re-emerging dangerous pathogens is important, and should not be stand-alone, but integrated within laboratory networks as seen in polio, measles, yellow fever and rubella. In 2015, WHO AFRO collaborated with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and partners in a series of consultations with countries and national and regional EQA providers for the development of quality assurance models to support HIV point-of-care testing and monitoring. These consultations revealed similar challenges as seen in the WHO AFRO surveys. WHO AFRO brought forth its experience in implementing quality standards for health programmes, and also opened discussions on how lessons learned through such established programmes can be utilised to supporting and strengthening the introduction of early infant diagnosis of HIV and viral load point-of-care testing. An optimised external quality assessment programme will impact the ability of countries to meet core capacities, providing improved quality management systems, improving the confidence of diagnostic network services in Africa, and including capacities to detect events of international public health importance.",The WHO AFRO external quality assessment programme (EQAP): Linking laboratory networks through EQA programmes, ,african journal of laboratory medicine,85022166936,2016,,,,,,
"© 2016, Brill Academic Publishers. China’s fiscal and taxation law reform is at a critical stage since Chinese economy development needs to consider compromising interests and conflicts from all sources, such as the social benefit network, real estate industry avidity, internationalizing currencies, fostering a philanthropic culture, and growing as a leader in the world market. These undertakings all demand a modern, handy fiscal and taxation law system. On the other hand, after two decades of implementation of the 1994 tax sharing system, the original initiative of strengthening centralized control might not keep pace with the needs of balancing decentralization and local financing demands, in addition to the troublesome taxpayers’ protection, tax judicature reform, and worsening environmental irregularities. Admittedly, China’s fiscal and taxation law reform faces new challenges and incentives. Rigorous international tax frameworks and multi-jurisdictional cooperation drive China to respond as an international trade giant and a responsible game player. Such international tax policy orientations create another layer of incentives and necessity for China to fine-tune its domestic fiscal and taxation legal framework, ranging from promotion of free trade zones, global sourcing practice and supply chain management, renegotiation of outdated tax treaty articles, more active participation in consequential overseas investments, to WTO Protocol compliance review, and international tax dispute resolution. Therefore, this article argues that, no matter the extent to which feasible, plausible or pragmatic proposals are presented, a top level architecting and a serious pursuit to upgrade citizens’ livelihood must be prioritized in earnest.",Focus: Disciplined approaches for constructing a rule of law order: Reconsiderations revised: An acute queening move for China’s taxation legal reform: Issues and proposals,International tax *** Rule of law *** Tax judicature *** Tax law reform,frontiers of law in china,85031508440,2016,,,,,,
"© 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to focus on adoption of certified management standards, specifically public standards. Such standards play an increasingly important role in today’s business environment. However, to generate adoption benefits, they must be first widely accepted – a situation where they have become viewed as the de facto norms. For this state to occur early adopters play a critical role. Past research has argued that early adopters, in exchange for assuming more risk, are rewarded with higher economic returns. Yet, these findings are based on private, not public standards. With public standards, early adopters do not receive such benefits. There is evidence that public standards are becoming more important. This situation leads to a simple but important question addressed in this study – if early adopters assume the risks of embracing a new public standard without economic benefits, then what is their motivation? To resolve this question, this study draws on agency theory and prospect theory. The authors argue that early adopters embrace such standards because of their desire to minimize risk resulting from failure to support the goal at the heart of the public standards. Design/methodology/approach: Data were obtained from the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) Partners Cost Benefit Survey and analyzed through structural equation modeling. Findings: Early adopters of public standards are not driven by economic benefits but rather by the need to minimize their exposure to the risks associated with failing to satisfy the goals associated with a public standard. In other words, they were motivated by the need to minimize costs. In the case of C-TPAT, these costs are those of failing to provide or improve network security. Research limitations/implications: This study has shed new light on the standards adoption process by clarifying the specific motivations that drive early adoption of a public standard. In addition to identifying the loss aversion motives of early adopters and economic benefit motives of later adopters, the authors have also elaborated on the notion that standards have differing levels of precedence, particularly when comparing private with public standards. Practical implications: In a world characterized by increasing demands for outcomes such as improved security and where governmental funding is falling, due to growing deficits and governments that are becoming more conservative, the authors expect the use of public standards to increase. Originality/value: Different from prior research on private standard, the paper focuses on the organizations involved in the adoption and diffusion of a public standard, with special attention being devoted to the early adopters. The paper provides a theoretical explanation for the actions of early adopters of a public standard through the theoretical lens of prospect theory.",Why be first if it doesn’t pay?

"© 2016 Jordan et al. Diversification of agroecological systems to enhance agrobiodiversity is likely to be critical to advancing environmental, economic, and social sustainability of agriculture. Temperate-zone agroecological systems that are currently organized for production of summer-annual crops can be diversified by integration of fallow-season and perennial crops. Integration of such crops can improve sustainability of these agroecological systems, with minimal interference with current agricultural production. Importantly, these crops can provide feedstocks for a wide range of new bio-products that are forming a new agricultural bioeconomy, potentially providing greatly increased economic incentives for diversification. However, while there are many fallow-season and perennial crops that might be used in such a ""bioeconomic"" strategy for diversification, most are not yet well adapted and highly-marketable. Efforts are underway to enhance adaptation and marketability of many such crops. Critically, these efforts require a strategic approach that addresses the inherent complexity of these projects. We outline a suitable approach, which we term ""sustainable commercialization"": a coordinated innovation process that integrates a new crop into the agriculture of a region, while intentionally addressing economic, environmental and social sustainability challenges via multi-stakeholder governance. This approach centers on a concerted effort to coordinate and govern innovation in three critical areas: germplasm development, multifunctional agroecosystem design and management, and development of end uses, supply chains, and markets. To exemplify the approach, we describe an ongoing effort to commercialize a new fallow-season crop, field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.).",Sustainable commercialization of new crops for the agricultural bioeconomy, ,elementa,84986292334,2016,,,,,,
"To mitigate and respond to supply chain risks, previous research usually views supply chain risk management as the management of various activities concerning risk identification, assessment, mitigation, and responses. While supply chain risk information plays a crucial role in the implementation and decisions of many of these activities, the importance of a firm's information processing capability to its supply chain risk management effort has received very little attention in the literature. Using information processing theory as the theoretical lens, we argue that a firm's capability in processing supply chain risk information, which comprises supply chain risk information sharing and supply chain risk information analysis, can improve operational performance, and this capability's effectiveness in improving performance is contingent on product-specific uncertainty characteristics (i.e., product complexity and product customization) and environment-related uncertainty characteristics (i.e., technology turbulence and market turbulence). We test the proposed theoretical model using data collected from 350 manufacturing firms in China. The results support that supply chain risk information processing capability comprises two constituent elements and has a positive effect on operational performance. The results also suggest that except for product complexity, all the other posited product-specific and environment-related uncertainty characteristics positively moderate the relationship between supply chain risk information capability and operational performance. We contribute to the literature by developing a theory-driven empirical model that integrates the core concepts of supply chain risk management and information processing theory to generate research findings with theoretical and managerial implications.",The Effectiveness of Supply Chain Risk Information Processing Capability: An Information Processing Perspective,Information processing capability *** supply chain risk (SCR) *** uncertainty characteristics,ieee transactions on engineering management,WOS:000386243700007,2016,,,,,,
"Reverse logistics is believed to be one of the most promising solutions for capturing the remaining values from used products and has been extensively focused by both academics and practitioners during the past two decades. Conceptual framework, mathematical programming, and computational algorithms have been developed for decision-making at strategic, tactical, and operational levels of a reverse supply chain. In this paper, a novel idea for the design and planning of a general reverse logistics network is suggested and formulated through multi-objective mixed integer programming. The reverse logistics system is an independent network and comprises of three echelons for collection, remanufacturing, recycling, energy recovery, and disposal of used products. The mathematical model not only takes into account the minimization of system operating costs, but also considers minimization of carbon emissions related to the transportation and processing of used products, and the minimum rate of resource utilization is also required in order to minimize the waste of resources in landfill. Illustration, sensitivity analysis, and numerical experimentation are given to show the applicability and computational efficiency of the proposed model. This work provides an alternative approach to account both economic and environmental sustainability of a reverse logistics system. The result explicitly shows the trade-off between the costs and carbon emissions, cost effectiveness for improving environmental performance, and influences from resource utilization, all of which have great practical implication on decision-making of network configurations and transportation planning of a reverse logistics system. For future development of this work, suggestions are also given latter in this paper.",A general reverse logistics network design model for product reuse and recycling with environmental considerations,Reverse logistics *** Network design *** Facility location *** Transportation planning *** Environmental impacts *** Carbon emissions *** Multi-objective programming *** Mixed integer programming,international journal of advanced manufacturing technology,WOS:000388988300021,2016,,,,,,
"One of the most critical issues facing supply chain managers in today's globalized and highly-uncertain business environment is how to proactively deal with risks that might cause serious severances and distortions of material flows in a supply chain. This paper proposes a simulation-based evolutionary algorithm approach for deriving the operational planning of global supply chains from the systematic risk management, which proactively deals with the negative consequences of random and hazardous risk events in sourcing, production, distribution, and transportation in an integrated way. The proposed approach incorporates the production lot size of the plant, order quantity and reorder point of DC, and five response coefficients as decision variables to potential risks. The proposed approach is successfully applied to an industrial example of a consumer electronics manufacturing company. The results of the computational study show that the systematic risk management of global supply chains using the proposed approach increases the profit by 20% and 16.1% in the industrial example in comparison with passive and active risk management, respectively. In addition, a mixed strategy for the inventory management of distribution centers is suggested to improve the profits of global supply chains subject to substantial risks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"Performance measurement of logistics companies is based upon various performance indicators. Yet, in the logistics industry, there are several vaguenesses, such as deciding on key indicators and determining interrelationships between performance indicators. In order to resolve these vaguenesses, this paper first presents the stakeholder-informed Balanced Scorecard (BSC) model, by incorporating financial (e.g. cost) and non-financial (e.g. social media) performance indicators, with a comprehensive approach as a response to the major shortcomings of the generic BSC regarding the negligence of different stakeholders. Subsequently, since the indicators are not independent of each other, a robust multi-criteria decision making technique, the Analytic Network Process (ANP) method is implemented to analyze the interrelationships. The integration of these two techniques provides a novel way to evaluate logistics performance indicators from logisticians' perspective. This is a matter that has not been addressed in the logistics industry to date, and as such remains a gap that needs. to be investigated. Therefore, the proposed model identifies key performance indicators as well as various stakeholders in the logistics industry, and analyzes the interrelationships among the indicators by using the ANP. Consequently, the results show that educated employee (15.61%) is the most important indicator for the competitiveness of logistics companies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Assessing sustainability of supply chains is a critical and increasingly complex problem. In recent years sustainability has received more attention in supply chain management (SCM) literature with triple bottom lines including social, environmental, and economic factors. Conventional data envelopment analysis (DEA) models consider decision making units (DMUs) as black boxes that consume a set of inputs to produce a set of outputs and do not take into consideration internal interactions of DMUs. Two-stage DEA models deal with such DMUs. However, existing two-stage DEA models are applicable only in technologies characterized by positive inputs/outputs. This paper aims to build and present a new two-stage DEA model considering negative input-intermediate-output data. Some numerical examples along with some theorems and properties are given to show capability of proposed method. The proposed ideas are used in a case study where 29 Iranian supply chains producing equipment of expendable medical devices are evaluated in terms of sustainability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Augmented Reality (AR) systems in last few years show great potentialities in the manufacturing context: recent pilot projects were developed for supporting quicker product and process design, as well as control and maintenance activities. The high technological complexity together with the wide variety of AR devices require a high technological skill; on the other hand, evaluating their actual impacts on the manufacturing process is still an open question. Few recent studies have analysed this topic by using qualitative approaches based on an ex post analysis i.e. after the design and/or the adoption of the AR system - for evaluating the effectiveness of a developed AR application. The paper proposes an expert based tool for supporting production managers and researchers in effectively evaluating a preliminary ex ante feasibility analysis for assessing quantitatively most efficient single AR devices (or combinations) to be applied in specific manufacturing processes. A multi-criteria model based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method has been proposed to provide decision makers with quantitative knowledge for more efficiently designing AR applications in manufacturing. The model allows to integrate, in the same decision support tool, technical knowledge regarding AR devices with critical process features characterizing manufacturing processes, thus allowing to assess the contribution of the AR device in a wider prospective compared to current technological analyses. A test case study about the evaluation of AR system in on-site maintenance service is also discussed aiming to validate the model, and to outline its global applicability and potentialities. Obtained results highlighted the full efficacy of the proposed model in supporting ex-ante feasibility studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"This study presents an empirical assessment and guides about measuring impact of GM (green manufacturing) practices on organisational performance in Indian context. The research approach is to extract critical GM factors from field data, to evaluate those factors which have positive impact on the organisational performance and to develop a model linking both critical factors and performance measures. The research follows survey method for data collection. A diagnostic research survey instrument is designed and used for data collection from the Indian manufacturing companies that have implemented/experienced GM. Authors not only developed model but also attempted its optimisation, checked its robustness through sensitivity analysis and worked out its ability to predict patterns and possible trends through artificial neural network (ANN) simulation. Further, this model is validated through a case company data to work out its intensity and efficacy as a demonstrative application in reducing,environmental footprints. The major contribution of this study is in the identification, prioritisation of guiding factors, its modelling, and validation, which influence various manufacturing practices, and drastically affect organisational performance. The study offers useful insights and guides about how industries should link both aspects critical GM factors and performance measures to channelize their GM initiatives, in order to improve environmental, operational and financial performance.

"Collaboration is an important factor to succeed and increase the sustainability in project management and construction, especially in a construction supply chain (CSC) that includes multiple partners. Although, in recent decades, many changes have occurred in the construction industry, there are still many problems in this area. Therefore, research in this area becomes vital because collaboration is one of the best approaches to improve CSC performance. In this study, collaborative relationship has been found to be affected by three main factors: managerial, financial and structural. However, application of collaboration in Iran is still in its inception. This comprehensive research study focuses on suitable context for implementing the collaboration method. The methodology of this research is based on interviews and a review of previous research, which identifies critical factors and positive results of use in relation to collaboration. Results of this study improve our knowledge about the role of collaboration in a CSC's performance.

"© 2014 Elsevier B.V. The aim of this article is to discuss how the systems science approach can be used to optimize intervention strategies in food animal systems. It advocates the idea that the challenges of maintaining a safe food supply are best addressed by integrating modeling and mathematics with biological studies critical to formulation of public policy to address these challenges. Much information on the biology and epidemiology of food animal systems has been characterized through single-discipline methods, but until now this information has not been thoroughly utilized in a fully integrated manner.The examples are drawn from our current research. The first, explained in depth, uses clinical mastitis to introduce the concept of dynamic programming to optimize management decisions in dairy cows (also introducing the curse of dimensionality problem). In the second example, a compartmental epidemic model for Johne's disease with different intervention strategies is optimized. The goal of the optimization strategy depends on whether there is a relationship between Johne's and Crohn's disease. If so, optimization is based on eradication of infection; if not, it is based on the cow's performance only (i.e., economic optimization, similar to the mastitis example). The third example focuses on food safety to introduce risk assessment using Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella Typhimurium. The last example, practical interventions to effectively manage antibiotic resistance in beef and dairy cattle systems, introduces meta-population modeling that accounts for bacterial growth not only in the host (cow), but also in the cow's feed, drinking water and the housing environment. Each example stresses the need to progress toward multi-scale modeling. The article ends with examples of multi-scale systems, from food supply systems to Johne's disease.Reducing the consequences of foodborne illnesses (i.e., minimizing disease occurrence and associated costs) can only occur through an understanding of the system as a whole, including all its complexities. Thus the goal of future research should be to merge disciplines such as molecular biology, applied mathematics and social sciences to gain a better understanding of complex systems such as the food supply chain.",Progression to multi-scale models and the application to food system intervention strategies,Dynamic programming *** Food supply system *** Infectious disease modeling *** Multi-scale modeling *** Risk assessment *** System science,preventive veterinary medicine,84921538693,2015,,,,,,
"In order to compete in the global environment, a manufacturing company has to keep developing new technologies. Selection of a right technology is a critical stage in a successful technology transfer process. However, technology selection is a complex multi-dimensional problem including both qualitative and quantitative factors, such as human resources, operational and financial dimensions, which may be in conflict and may also be uncertain. In addition, interdependent relationships exist among various dimensions as well as criteria of technology selection. The identified problems could be solved by combining multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methods of different nature and fuzzy set theory. The objective of the current paper is to develop a complex approach to evaluate technologies and to rank their appropriateness for a company. A hybrid model is proposed, based on Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP) and Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FTOPSIS).

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report on a field-level examination of the adoption of sustainable procurement in social housing. It explores the role of regulation and procurement consortia in sustainable procurement. Design/methodology/approach - The study employs a case study of the UK social housing sector and uses an online survey (n = 116) of UK Housing Associations. Factor analysis identifies three parsimonious dimensions of sustainable procurement. Attitudinal data are analysed to explore the field-level adoption of sustainable procurement and the role of consortia. Findings - The results delineate sustainable procurement activities into three factors; direction setting, supplier-centric assurance and local socially oriented supply. High yet sup-optimal levels of sustainable procurement activity are revealed. Prevailing attitudes identify positive commitments to sustainable procurement at individual, organisational and sector levels. The value of network collaboration is identified. Tenants as critical stakeholders do not prioritise sustainable procurement creating challenge for inclusivity. Regulators are seen to a have low level of sustainable procurement knowledge and procurement consortia a high perceived knowledge. Research limitations/implications - Results provide insight into the effect of sustainable procurement policy, the role of regulators and network structures and consortia, raising issues around legitimacy, coopetition, stakeholder engagement, performance measurement, and functional/sectoral maturity. Social implications - The identification of the potential exclusion of tenants in sustainability debates is particularly significant to deliver social value.

"© 2015, South African Water Research Commission. All rights reserved. South Africa’s extensive mineral resources have resulted in mining activities dispersed across the country, playing a critical role in its socio-economic development. In contrast to this abundance of mineral wealth, water resources are generally limited, and vulnerable to environmental impacts from the mining industry. These circumstances make tailored management of water resources in the mining sector essential. To achieve this, detailed information on water use throughout a mine operation as well as an accurate water balance account is required. Blue-water footprints have the potential to contribute to this task as they allow for quantification of direct and indirect water use across the supply chain of a process, while incorporating both spatial extension and temporal duration. As defined by the Water Footprint Network’s (WFN) globally acknowledged water footprint assessment methodology, a blue-water footprint is determined by calculating the net consumptive use of water by an operation. According to the WFN, this includes water which is evaporated, incorporated into a product, or lost to outflows which do not return to the same catchment area in the same period.The applicability of this tool in the mining sector has not been fully explored. Therefore, it was decided to investigate the bluewater footprint of a South African platinum mining operation. The results showed that the largest consumption of water in the production of platinum was due to evaporation from the mineral processing plants (36.8%) and the tailings storage facilities (19.4%). To improve its water-use efficiency, measures should be taken by the operation to mitigate evaporative losses. Floating covers can assist in this effort as they reflect a proportion of the incoming solar radiation and act as a physical barrier to the passage of water vapour, both vertically and horizontally.",Assessing the blue-water footprint of an opencast platinum mine in South Africa,Cleaner production *** Footprinting *** Platinum group metals,water sa,84929405160,2015,,,,,,
"""To succeed in the modern economy you need technical and adaptive skills. Technical skills and specialized knowledge makes you a more efficient and productive worker, but it can lock you in to a part of the division of labor that can disappear over night in the winds of creative destruction that increasingly sweep across the economy. Across both natural and human systems, processes that increase the efficient production of wealth and stored energy undermine resilience"" (Swanstrom, 2008: 6-7). In fact, at a time of crisis it seems that the territories are even more vulnerable and fragile: emerging social issues (like new poverty), new needs, frayed social fabrics and lack of social networks. This syndrome of weakness can be remedied only if the collective intelligence of an area tries to develop development policies for education and culture of legality, stimulating 'communities of practices' and investing in intangible factors of development. A successful economy creates tight connections between the industry, society and the government (e.g. Triple Helix Model) but these same connections can make difficult to shift public policies and redeploy assets in the face of a crisis (Safford 2004). Similarly, lean companies with just-on-time production and global supply chains, may be highly efficient but they are vulnerable to disruptions (Sheffi, 2007). This paper analyzes the mechanisms of adaptation and self-organization to promote resilience; particularly, after describing the relationship between risk, resilience and sustainability, we have focused on the ecological model of resilience that reconciles the contradiction mentioned above through the idea of panarchy that captures the ""evolutionary nature of adaptive cycles that are nested one within each other across space and time"" (Holling, 2001: 396).",The spaces of resilience: Learning and adaptation,Learning *** Resilience *** Sustainable development,italian sociological review,84930827797,2015,,,,,,
"This paper analyses the contribution of Alternative Food Networks (AFNs) to the conservation of agro-biodiversity. After reviewing the literature to identify existing approaches and methodologies to assess the environmental impacts of AFNs, the need to introduce territorial and historical contexts and critical thresholds to specifically analyse AFNs impacts on agro-biodiversity is highlighted. By building on these critical aspects, an operational approach is proposed and adopted to analyse two case studies on the role played by AFNs in conserving local agro-biodiversity in Tuscany, Italy: the cherry varieties of ciliegia di Lari and the local bovine breed of Calvana, both at risk of extinction. The scope of these two case studies is to understand if and how conservation of local agro-biodiversity is enhanced by AFNs and, if this is the case, what are the causes for AFNs having positive impacts on agro-biodiversity conservation. From results of the two case studies it is possible to highlight the suitability and usefulness of the approach proposed, not just to identify the actual or potential contribution of the two AFNs to biodiversity conservation, but also to formulate policy recommendations for local rural development.

"In designing a supply chain (SC) system, the problem arises when a company has unsatisfactory inventory control policy and material routing between supplier-producer and distributor in SC considering specified cost and demand. The integration of decisions of different functions into a single optimization model is the base of this research. The aim of this paper is to study and compare the existing models of supply, production and distribution in SC and propose a model which integrates mentioned criteria in supply chain management (SCM). Furthermore, it proposes a new method for calculation of fitness function in genetic algorithm (GA) process. The successful designing of this model has led us to explore the use of heuristic methods such as GA to quantify the flow of SC, information and material flow. At first, fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) is adapted to evaluate objective function weights in SC. Then final weights of objective function are determined by the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). This research also simulated the real company SC operations, and determines the most effective strategic and operational policies for an effective SC system. The result obtained from the model shows that it is robust. This model can also be applied to other industrial environments with slight modifications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"The optimal design and operations of shale gas supply chains under uncertainty of estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) is addressed. A two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear fractional programming (SMILFP) model is developed to optimize the levelized cost of energy generated from shale gas. In this model, both design and planning decisions are considered with respect to shale well drilling, shale gas production, processing, multiple end-uses, and transportation. To reduce the model size and number of scenarios, we apply a sample average approximation method to generate scenarios based on the real-world EUR data. In addition, a novel solution algorithm integrating the parametric approach and the L-shaped method is proposed for solving the resulting SMILFP problem within a reasonable computational time. The proposed model and algorithm are illustrated through a case study based on the Marcellus shale play, and a deterministic model is considered for comparison.

"We develop a distribution network model for a decentralized supply chain to investigate the optimal decisions of participants in an uncertain demand environment. The supply chain consists of one manufacturer and set of independent candidate distributors that distribute products to geographically dispersed markets in a competitive manner. All chain's participants are assumed risk-sensitive. The stability of a distribution network depends on the fuzzy commitment of its distributors. The novelty of the paper lies in the manufacturer concerns about the preferences of the distributors to ensure stability of his distribution network. Hence, the manufacturer considers criteria of expected profit, variance of profit, and stability level to evaluate distribution alternatives. A decision-making methodology is presented for evaluation and selection the distribution network design alternatives. The tactical decisions in each distribution alternative are obtained from a Stackelberg game formulated as a bi-level distributed programming problem. We show that the methodology is able to capture a principal trade-off between the preferences of manufacturer and contractor distributors. Managerial insights are obtained through an illustrative example and its sensitivity analyses.",Distribution network design of a decentralized supply chain with fuzzy committed distributors,Game theory *** decentralized supply chain *** bi-level distributed programming *** distribution network design *** demand uncertainty,journal of intelligent & fuzzy systems,WOS:000362627100031,2015,,,,,,
"The semiconductor packaging and testing industry, which utilizes high-technology manufacturing processes and a variety of machines, belongs to an uncertain make-to-order (MTO) production environment. Order release particularly originates from customer demand; hence, demand fluctuation directly affects capacity planning. Thus, managing capacity allocation is a difficult endeavor. This study aims to determine the best capacity allocation with limited resources to maximize the net profit. Three bottleneck stations in the semiconductor packaging and testing process are mainly investigated, namely, die bond (DB), wire bond (WB), and molding (MD) stations. Deviating from previous studies that consider the deterministic programming model, customer demand in the current study is regarded as an uncertain parameter in formulating a two-stage scenario-based stochastic programming (SP) model. The SP model seeks to respond to sharp demand fluctuations. Even if future demand is uncertain, migration decision for machines and tools will still obtain better robust results for various demand scenarios. A hybrid approach is proposed to solve the SP model. Moreover, two assessment indicators, namely, the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) and the value of the stochastic solution (VSS), are adopted to compare the solving results of the deterministic planning model and stochastic programming model. Sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the effects of different parameters on net profit.",An Application of Stochastic Programming in Solving Capacity Allocation and Migration Planning Problem under Uncertainty, ,mathematical problems in engineering,WOS:000367242800001,2015,,,,,,

The purpose of this study is to develop a mathematical programming model for managing reverse flows in end-of-life vehicles' recovery network. A reverse flow is the collection of used products from consumers and the transportation of these products for the purpose of recycling, reuse or disposal. The proposed model includes all operations in a product recovery and waste management network for used vehicles and reuse for vehicle parts such as collection, disassembly, refurbishing, processing (shredding), recycling, disposal and reuse of vehicle parts. The scope of the network model is to determine the numbers and locations of facilities in the network and the material flows between these facilities. The results show the performance of the model and its applicability for use in the planning of recovery operations in the automotive industry. The main objective of recovery and waste management is to maximize revenue and minimize pollution in end-of-life product operations. This study shows that with an accurate model, these activities may provide economic benefits and incentives in addition to protecting the environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"The task of design, planning and operation of manufacturing networks is becoming more and more challenging for companies, as globalisation, mass customisation and the turbulent economic landscape create demand volatility, uncertainties and high complexity. In this context, this paper investigates the performance of decentralised manufacturing networks through a set of methods developed into a software framework in a toolbox approach. The Tabu Search and Simulated Annealing metaheuristic methods are used together with an Artificial Intelligence method, called Intelligent Search Algorithm. A multi-criteria decision making procedure is carried out for the evaluation of the quality of alternative manufacturing network configurations using multiple conflicting criteria including dynamic complexity, reliability, cost, time, quality and environmental footprint. A comparison of the performance of each method based on the quality of the solutions that it provided is carried out. The statistical design of experiments robust engineering technique is used for the calibration of the adjustable parameters of the methods. Moreover, the impact of demand fluctuation to the operational performance of the alternative networks, expressed thorough a dynamic complexity indicator, is investigated through simulation. The developed framework is validated through a real life case, with data coming from the CNC machine building industry. (C) 2014 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"We develop an end-to-end model of a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC), and identify the systemic decision making required for economic viability of participants in this chain. Economic viability is a key ingredient for environmentally sustainable behavior and policies, and our decision making framework includes producers, refurbishers and recyclers. We model the lifecycle of a consumer electronics product to examine the complex interactions among different participants and their decisions. Using data from recyclers and marketing and supply chain literature, we find that i) sustainable CLSC policies require a well-calibrated return rate among types of products (new and refurbished) and consumers (innovators and imitators); ii) a sustainable return policy increases sales significantly for both types of customers; and iii) product design that improves refurbishability, and marketing efforts that create perceived differentiation between products and at the same time social awareness and acceptability for refurbished products, is critical for economic sustainability of refurbishers and recyclers. Our model can be used at a company or industry level to conduct cost-benefit scenarios for all participants of the CLSC, and make decisions based on systemic value. It can also be used to create public policies and incentives to reward companies that meet these benchmarks, for sustained economic and environmental benefits. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"Whey is a by-product of cheese making that is a potentially important source of nutrients, but which currently goes to disposal in many parts of the world. In this paper, we analyse the efficiency of investment in whey-processing with the aim of releasing the productive potential of currently unexploited whey supply chains. We introduce a decision support model for production and distribution of products derived from whey that extends a globally inclusive facility location problem. The basic tenet of the model is that equipment selection during the initial stages of facility planning is critical, as capital costs in the early stages of supply chain design go into purchases of new machines and site conditioning. The model selects the optimal combination of whey processing equipment, facility locations and transportation routes subject to budget, equipment availability and final product requirements. The results from the model inform the members of a cluster of cheese makers on the infrastructure investments that better release the productive potential of the supply chain of their valuable by-product and, at the same time, avoid environmental damage. We use the model to find the optimal configuration of a whey supply chain for an actual cluster of small cheese makers in Minas Gerais, Brazil, and demonstrate that important savings can be achieved by investing early on in adequate processing facilities.

"Reverse logistics practices are gaining attention due to industrial ecology, enforced legislation and corporate citizenship but presence of barriers make reverse logistics (RL) implementation difficult and hence reduce the success rate. To increase RL adoption, robust and flexible strategies are required to overcome its barriers. This study focuses on identification and ranking the solutions of reverse logistics adoption in electronics industry to overcome its barriers. It aids firms to ponder on high rank solutions and develop strategies to implement them on priority. This paper proposes a methodology based on fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to identify and rank the solutions of RL adoption to overcome its barriers. Fuzzy AHP is applied to get weights of the barriers as criteria by pairwise comparison and final ranking of the solutions of RL adoption is obtained through fuzzy TOPSIS. The empirical case of Indian electronics industry is shown to illustrate the use of the proposed method. This proposed method offers a more precise, efficient and effective decision support tool for stepwise implementation of the solutions due to consideration of fuzzy environment. Finally sensitivity analysis is performed to illustrate the robustness of the method. (C) 2015 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"This paper investigates the effect of management-level professional ties between suppliers and customers on the sustainability of business partnerships. We find that the presence of cross-firm professional ties between directors and senior executives along the supply chain significantly reduces the probability of relationship termination around customers' industry negative shocks and during financial crises. The results are robust using professional-tie strength as an alternative measure. Exploring contingency effects, we find that, for suppliers who lack R&D, face high competition, are smaller in size, or are less important to customers in terms of sales, such professional ties are more helpful in sustaining such relationships. Furthermore, we find that professional ties also significantly reduce firm risk during periods of market turbulence. Taken together, our results suggest that professional ties along the supply chain can facilitate information flow and build mutual trust, which can lead to healthy long-term relationships and can help firms survive economic and industry downturns.

"The paper aims at developing a robust model that can capture, calculate and manage emissions activity across a transportation and distribution network to enable corporate social responsibility practices via identifying the carbon intensive activities within the transport and extended enterprise. This is a multi-attribute problem where a number of variables need to be taken into account across the different echelons of the supply chain. A case company X from the apparel industry is used for the purposes of the study. The supply chain carbon assessment study requires defining the system boundaries, process mapping of the activities involved, identifying key data requirements, collecting and sampling primary and secondary data and calculating emissions based on fuel or distance factors. The research culminates in creating a scenario-planning tool with cost, effective lead time and carbon emissions as model attributes. As part of the research, literature is reviewed on best practices and methodologies and interviews conducted with functional heads, 3PL managers and experts from the apparel industry. In the end, the created tool enables companies to gauge their emissions, optimize them within their respective supply chains and identify key indicators for carbon reduction in inbound networks.

"© 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited. Purpose – Supply chain (SC) is a homogeneous and interconnected network of firms which manages supplies, storages and handles material, information, personnel, equipment and final products throughout its length. The SC can be the means by which businesses add value to customers and therefore competitive advantage in the international market. Competitiveness no longer exists among individual members of a SC but between SCs. International literature pointed out, that strategy and competitiveness associated with specific strategic priorities. In this paper will be documented that the priorities as objectives of strategic importance comprise the key areas for the performance of the SC network. To support this, a systematic framework of strategic priorities, will be developed, which will visualize the major SC assessment areas that the SC network should turn its improvement efforts. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – In total, 200 high level managers from 71 Greek manufacturing companies covering the whole country using their own SC networks took part in the study. Data analysis were conducted to create a model that describes the strategic priorities which are important, for the competitive advantage of their SC network. Findings – The results revealed seven critical strategic priorities: internal flexibility, production quality, waste reduction, customer focus, sustainability, reduction of production cost and efficiency. This paper analytically explores the strategic practices that seem to influence SC network performance and generates a systematic framework of the critical strategic priorities of the SC network performance. Practical implications – The proposed framework has six major advantages. First the research outcome enables managers to design their SC strategy. Second, proved the great importance of the strategic priorities institutionalization. Third, makes clear to stakeholders which are the SC network performance issues to consider. Fourth, the proposed framework could serve as a suitable formula for assessing the effectiveness and readiness of SC to face the competition. Fifth, it is an effective way of prioritizing the strategic practices as it provides the most important areas on which the firm can base tasks like evaluation, benchmarking and comparison of its SC both as a network and as individual firms. Finally, the proposed framework is an effective way to evaluate the consistency of strategic objectives and actions adopted for the SC. Originality/value – Literature review revealed a very important conclusion. It has been developed a broad discussion concerning issues on strategic practices which are responsible for the competitive advantage of the SC network. However, there has not been a significant effort on integrating all the practices under the spectrum of the SC in order to distinguish the most important of these practices that can lead to competitive advantages.",Towards the identification of important strategic priorities of the supply chain network: An empirical investigation,Competitive advantage *** Factor analysis *** Priorities *** Strategic practices *** Structural equation modelling *** Supply chain network,business process management journal,84944556958,2015,,,,,,
"© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. With advancement in radio frequency identification (RFID), RFID-based track-and-trace anti-counterfeiting has attracted considerable research interests. Track-and-trace anti-counterfeiting demands a trustworthy electronic pedigree (e-pedigree), which records the movements of product items from manufacturers to retailers, to ensure high supply chain visibility and to provide evidence for product authentication. Creation and synchronization of initial e-pedigrees in the manufacturing stage is particularly crucial to the accuracy and trustworthiness of subsequent processing of the e-pedigrees and authentication of product items. This is a critical yet challenging task, as it involves a number of practical issues, such as incomplete tag writing/locking, environment disturbances, and potential data falsification. This paper first presents an innovative track-and-trace anti-counterfeiting system, and then proposes a tag data processing and synchronization (TDPS) algorithm to generate initial e-pedigrees for general, tangible products during production. An RFID-enabled apparel packaging line is established to validate the performance of TDPS and identify the bottleneck of e-pedigree generation. Experiment results show that TDPS can create accurate and secure initial e-pedigrees for fast moving product items, and that tag EPC writing is a major bottleneck of e-pedigree generation. Thus, we optimise TDPS by incorporating a block writing method and an integrated verification step to remove the bottleneck. Further experiments demonstrate the optimised TDPS can be adapted to suit different practical requirements to achieve a good balance between tag writing/locking rate and the moving speed of product items in packaging lines without severing the throughput.",RFID tag data processing in manufacturing for track-and-trace anti-counterfeiting,Anti-counterfeiting *** Data synchronization *** e-Pedigree *** RFID *** Tag programming *** Track-and-trace,computers in industry,84923633983,2015,,,,,,
"© 2015 by the authors. The metropolitan city of Istanbul is becoming overcrowded and the demand for clean water is steeply rising in the city. The use of analytical approaches has become more and more critical for forecasting the water supply and demand balance in the long run. In this research, Istanbul's water supply and demand data is collected for the period during 2006 and 2014. Then, using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, the time series water supply and demand forecasting model is constructed for the period between 2015 and 2018. Three important sustainability metrics such as water loss to supply ratio, water loss to demand ratio, and water loss to residential demand ratio are also presented. The findings show that residential water demand is responsible for nearly 80% of total water use and the consumption categories including commercial, industrial, agriculture, outdoor, and others have a lower share in total water demand. The results also show that there is a considerable water loss in the water distribution system which requires significant investments on the water supply networks. Furthermore, the forecasting results indicated that pipeline projects will be critical in the near future due to expected increases in the total water demand of Istanbul. The authors suggest that sustainable management of water can be achieved by reducing the residential water use through the use of water efficient technologies in households and reduction in water supply loss through investments on distribution infrastructure.",A framework for sustainable urban water management through demand and supply forecasting: The case of Istanbul,ARIMA *** Demand *** Istanbul *** Time-series forecasting *** Urban water sustainability *** Water supply,sustainability (switzerland),84940513123,2015,,,,,,
"© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. Global demand for palm oil is increasing to fulfil worldwide needs for cooking oil, food ingredients, biofuels, soap and other chemicals. In response, palm oil production is rapidly expanding which promotes economic growth in producing countries but also leads to serious environmental and social problems such as destruction of tropical forests, climate change and threats to small-holder livelihoods. For these reasons, palm oil production and use have become highly controversial. However, the global character of palm oil production and consumption, the number of different actors involved and its multiple uses makes promotion its sustainability highly complex. Individual nation-states can no longer control and regulate a global flow like palm oil and alternative governing networks appear involving private companies and NGOs. Acknowledging the roles of such governance networks with different forms of power means that relying only on economic and political power to explain current dynamics in the palm oil sector is inadequate. In global networks like palm oil supply, encompassing transnational material flows and multiple actors, the relevance of each actor relates to his position in the network. Power in global palm oil supply is therefore not only related to their position in the (vertical) supply chains, but also to their role in the horizontal networks. New forms of power in networks arise from steering the networks (programming) and from connecting different networks (switching). In the multiple networks that compose global palm oil provision today, different programmers and switchers play critical roles. This is briefly illustrated in this paper on the basis of different cases of active steering in global palm oil provision.",Promoting sustainable palm oil: Viewed from a global networks and flows perspective,Environmental flows *** Environmental governance *** Global networks *** Palm oil,journal of cleaner production,84942984886,2015,,,,,,
"© 2015 Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. Supply chain risk management has drawn great attention from both researchers and practitioners in recent years. Economic globalization and the resultant complexity of the supply chain network plus the uncertainty of the environment makes risk and vulnerability a major challenge to related firms. This paper aims to establish a conceptual model for mitigating supply chain risk by introducing two variables named supply chain integration and organizational risk propensity. Based on extensive literature review, some major propositions are proposed including the following four aspects: supply chain risk is negatively related to supply chain integration; supply chain integration is positively related to company performance; organizational risk propensity moderates the relationship between supply chain risk and supply chain integration; the integrative model is moderated-mediation. The integrative model is theoretically valuable in further exploring the internal path and mechanism of the impact of supply chain risk on a firm's performance. The model is also practically useful in providing suggestions and references for supply chain risk management and supply chain integration. Finally, the future directions for empirical research are also presented.",A conceptual model of supply chain risk mitigation: The role of supply chain integration and organizational risk propensity,firm performance *** organizational risk propensity *** supply chain integration *** Supply chain risk,journal of coastal research,84925384928,2015,,,,,,

Supply chain network (SCN) problem deals with selecting compatible and competent partners and description of materials, information and financial flow at different nodes in networks. Because of uncertain existence in supply chain networks, companies encounter risk in their business. The purpose of this paper is optimal designing of supply chain networks with multiproduct and multi-customer by minimization per unit cost of supply and its variance in risky environments. An interactive fuzzy goal programming is used to achieve these objectives; simultaneously. A risk diagram is used as a method to take risk issues into account by considering the probability and consequence of risk events. Credibility measure is developed to give the assurance that risk consequences are lower than a given risk level with maximum possible confidence level. Uncertainties are considered in the model by fuzzy concept as risk elements. Examples are illustrated and numerical results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Finally, as shown in results, the effects of disruption risks are mitigated in whole SCN with optimal orders allocation.",A confident supply chain network model using credibility measure under uncertainty condition,credibility measure *** fuzzy logic *** interactive fuzzy goal programming *** Supply chain risk management (SCRM),journal of intelligent and fuzzy systems,84942929547,2015,,,,,,

Abstract: Supply chains and other trade networks are of interest to geographers, due to their ability to connect economic processes at various scales. Relatively recent research, however, suggests that core concepts and topics in economic geography are not being fully and effectively engaged in the classroom environment. With such findings as a motivation, this article explores the integration of an online case study on the geographies of supply chains and their vulnerability to natural disasters into introductory human geography and world regional geography courses. Post-lesson survey results intimate that there are differences between the two courses with respect to understanding some economic geography concepts but relative agreement in interpreting how regionalized natural phenomena can disrupt international business networks.",Examining the Geographies of Supply Chains in Introductory Coursework,economic geography *** geography education *** higher education *** natural disasters *** supply chains,service industries journal,84926327285,2015,,,,,,
"© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. Schedules of supply chains are generated with buffers to absorb the effect of disruptive events that could occur during their execution. Schedules can be systematically repaired through specific modifications within buffers by using appropriate decision models that consider the distributed nature of a supply chain. To this aim, information of disruptive events at occurrence or in advance allows decision models to make better decisions. To detect and predict disruptive events along a schedule execution, a service-oriented monitoring subsystem that uses a reference model for defining monitoring models was proposed. This subsystem offers services for collecting execution data of a schedule and environment data, and assessing them to detect/anticipate disruptive events. Because of the distributed nature and the complexity of these services functionalities, this paper presents an agent-based approach for their implementation. This technology allows dealing with supply chain monitoring by structuring monitoring subsystem functionalities as a set of autonomous entities. These entities are able to perform tailored plans created at execution time to concurrently monitor different schedules. A case study is described to try out the implemented prototype system.",Agent-based monitoring service for management of disruptive events in supply chains,Disruptive event *** Model-driven development *** Monitoring *** Multiagent system *** Supply chain,computers in industry,84928468924,2015,,,,,,
"© 2015 ACM. Globalization of the integrated circuit design and manufacturing flow has successfully ameliorated design complexity and fabrication cost challenges, and helped deliver cost-effective products while meeting stringent time-to-market requirements. On the flip side, it has resulted in various forms of security vulnerabilities in the supply chain that involves designers, fabs, test facilities, and distributors until the end-product reaches customers. One of the biggest threats to semiconductor industry today is the entry of aged, reject, or cloned parts, that is, counterfeit chips, into the supply chain, leading to annual revenue losses in the order of billions of dollars. While traceability of chips between trusted parties can help monitor the supply chain at various points in the flow, existing solutions are in the form of integrating costly hardware units on chip, or utilizing easy-to-circumvent inspection-based detection techniques. In this article, we propose a technique for adaptive unique ID generation that leverages process variations, enabling chip traceability. The proposed method stimulates digital chips with an analog signal from the supply lines, which serve as primary inputs to each gate in the signal path. Using a sinusoidal signal that exercises the transistors as gain components, we create a chip-specific response that can be post-processed into a digital ID. The proposed technique enables quick and cost-effective authenticity validation that requires no on-chip hardware support. Our simulation and experimentation on actual chips show that the proposed technique is capable of generating unique IDs even in the presence of environmental noise.",Adaptive generation of unique IDs for digital chips through analog excitation,Counterfeiting *** Hardware security *** ID generation,acm transactions on design automation of electronic systems,84934753761,2015,,,,,,

That supply chain management and logistics are a determining factor for the long term success of a company was well documented by Forrester over a half century ago (Forester, 1958), with the importance of the statement only growing through the intervening years. Whether consciously factored into the operating mode or not, logistics and distribution channel management plays a critical role in the life, and death, of a firm. From the rudimentary beginnings of the start-up company to the hectic world of the growth company and onto the relatively secure existence in mature markets, the value chain consisting of logistics and distribution channel linkages follows the firm, until it solidifies into immutable form of the mature value chain and begins to exert an inexorable pressure on the survival of the entire chain, and conversely the chain imposes its will on the members. The emergence of mature industry value chains is often driven by the need to monopolistically control logistics and distribution channels which provides a competitive advantage but also introduces a serious exposure to pending shock loadings of the chain.",Risk profiles of emerging and established value chains in dynamic markets,Business process *** Complexity *** Life cycle *** Organizational factors *** Risk,ifac-papersonline,84953851387,2015,,,,,,

Owing to the rapid growth of environmental and managerial issues, remanufacturing of products has emerged as a significant topic. The main focus of this paper is on the uncertainty in a closed-loop supply chain network, and a robust optimization technique is presented to overcome it. In this regard, an uncertain interval-based robust optimization model with two distinct demand streams is proposed; simultaneously, the uncertainty of shortage and penalty costs are taken into account for both new and remanufactured products, which have distinguished behaviors. To illustrate the preference of the proposed robust model, the optimality of deterministic and robust optimization models is examined in different test problems.

"© 2014 Taylor  &  Francis. Improving performance of global supply chains requires careful consideration of various factors including distance from markets, access to resources, exchange and tax rates, import tariffs, and trade regulations. In this paper, a comprehensive optimization model is proposed to maximise the after-tax profit of a closed-loop global supply chain for medical devices under uncertainty. The uncertainty of the decision-making environment is modelled using the budget of uncertainty concept in interval robust optimization. International financial issues due to the Economic Cooperation Organisation Trade Agreement as well as national regulations including transfer pricing limitations, exchange rates, tax rates, and import tariffs are considered. The proposed model considers various realistic assumptions pertaining to medical device supply chains such as multiple products, multiple periods, multiple echelons, and limited warehousing lifetime. In addition, reverse flows of perished and defective products are considered to address environmental concerns and customers requirements as well as to gain economic advantages. To tackle this problem, an efficient memetic algorithm is developed that incorporates adaptive variable neighbourhood search as its local search heuristic. Computational results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model in dealing with uncertainty in an agile manufacturing context. In addition, several managerial insights are discussed based on the results.",Robust closed-loop global supply chain network design under uncertainty: The case of the medical device industry,adaptive variable neighbourhood search *** global supply chain network design *** green supply chain management *** memetic algorithm *** robust optimization,international journal of production research,84961289843,2015,,,,,,
"© 2013 IEEE. Supply chain formation (SCF) is the process of determining the set of participants and exchange relationships within a network with the goal of setting up a supply chain that meets some predefined social objective. Many proposed solutions for the SCF problem rely on centralized computation, which presents a single point of failure and can also lead to problems with scalability. Decentralized techniques that aid supply chain emergence offer a more robust and scalable approach by allowing participants to deliberate between themselves about the structure of the optimal supply chain. Current decentralized supply chain emergence mechanisms are only able to deal with simplistic scenarios in which goods are produced and traded in single units only and without taking into account production capacities or input-output ratios other than 1:1. In this paper, we demonstrate the performance of a graphical inference technique, max-sum loopy belief propagation (LBP), in a complex multiunit unit supply chain emergence scenario which models additional constraints such as production capacities and input-to-output ratios. We also provide results demonstrating the performance of LBP in dynamic environments, where the properties and composition of participants are altered as the algorithm is running. Our results suggest that max-sum LBP produces consistently strong solutions on a variety of network structures in a multiunit problem scenario, and that performance tends not to be affected by on-the-fly changes to the properties or composition of participants.",Using the max-sum algorithm for supply chain emergence in dynamic multiunit environments,Max-sum algorithm *** mechanism design *** supply chain formation (SCF),"ieee transactions on systems, man, and cybernetics: systems",84923234044,2015,,,,,,
"Copyright © 2015 The Pennsylvania State University. Based on the theoretical underpinnings of the relational view of competitive advantage, the current study investigates the performance implications of three critical relational resource elements in supply chain partnerships: resource specificity, resource complementarity, and supply chain collaboration. The research also explores the interrelationship dynamics among these sources of relational rent - critical to the understanding of superior supply chain performance. The study models environmental dynamism and complexity to investigate the nature of the relationships among relational resources as they interact with technological and market turbulence factors. Operational productivity improvements are the primary outcome measures in the current research. Empirical evidence, based on the survey data of a cross-section of US manufacturing firms from a wide range of industries, supports a majority of our arguments, thus providing critical theoretical and managerial insights. The findings reiterate the importance of collaborative initiatives in the supply chain for operational benefits and high levels of customer service. The results also shed light on the interrelationships among relational resource elements, filling inadequacies in previous literature: resource specificity and complementarity are found to be antecedents of collaboration. The findings also suggest that complementary resources facilitate coordinated partner activities under highly turbulent technological environments.",Relational resource antecedents and operational outcome of supply chain collaboration: The role of environmental turbulence,Market turbulence *** Resource complementarity *** Resource specificity *** Supply chain collaboration *** Technological turbulence,transportation journal,84929626731,2015,,,,,,
"© 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Currently, reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and fuel consumption has become a critical environmental problem and has attracted the attention of both academia and the industrial sector. Government regulations and customer demands are making environmental responsibility an increasingly important factor in overall supply chain operations. Within these operations, transportation has the most hazardous effects on the environment, i.e., CO2 emissions, fuel consumption, noise and toxic effects on the ecosystem. This study aims to construct vehicle routes with time windows that minimize the total fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. The green vehicle routing problem with time windows (G-VRPTW) is formulated using a mixed integer linear programming model. A memory structure adapted simulated annealing (MSA-SA) meta-heuristic algorithm is constructed due to the high complexity of the proposed problem and long solution times for practical applications. The proposed models are integrated with a fuel consumption and CO2 emissions calculation algorithm that considers the vehicle technical specifications, vehicle load, and transportation distance in a green supply chain environment. The proposed models are validated using well-known instances with different numbers of customers. The computational results indicate that the MSA-SA heuristic is capable of obtaining good G-VRPTW solutions within a reasonable amount of time by providing reductions in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.",A memory structure adapted simulated annealing algorithm for a green vehicle routing problem,CO  emissions 2 *** Fuel consumption *** Green logistics *** Green vehicle routing problem *** Mixed integer linear programming model *** Simulated annealing algorithm,environmental science and pollution research,84933516240,2015,,,,,,
"© 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. In an increasingly interconnected world, physical, service, and digital supply networks are becoming progressively more complex, dynamic, and interdependent. Moreover, sustainability concerns push for higher efficiency in the use of resources, reducing protective redundancies and making supply networks more susceptible to disruptions. Supply network resilience is an emerging concept related to the inherent ability of a network to tolerate and overcome disruptions, a central capacity to achieve long term-sustainable operations. However, current understanding of the impact of network formation and re-configuration mechanisms on resilience is at its early stages. In this article, resilience by teaming (RBT) association decisions, inspired in the fault-tolerance by teaming principle from Collaborative Control Theory, are characterized and applied in network formation and re-configuration mechanisms. The impact of RBT on emerging supply network topology and resilience under targeted and random disruptions is measured and compared to scenarios were only traditional association rules are applied. Results show that the introduction of supply network agents using RBT association rules significantly (1) increases quality of service (QoS) with no significant cost increase in normal operation, (2) increases post-disruption QoS by 15-30% under random disruptions and 10% under targeted disruptions without cost increase vs. normal operation - when at least 20% of the agents use RBT association rules.",Resilience by teaming in supply network formation and re-configuration,Collaborative Control Theory *** Complex adaptive systems *** Complex networks *** Fault-tolerance by teaming *** Supplier selection,international journal of production economics,84920540159,2015,,,,,,
"© 2014, © 2014 Taylor  &  Francis. Despite its potential benefits in a wide range of circumstances, firm innovativeness received scant attention in relation to managing the various risks and uncertainties in the global business environment. Likewise, there is still a limited understanding of firms’ supply chain resilience (SCR) and its related antecedents in the strategic management literature. This research focuses on exploring the relationship between firm innovativeness and SCR in an attempt to facilitate bridging the gap between two important research streams and shed some light on the contingent value of firm innovativeness against disruptions and adversities. The moderating role of supply uncertainty and interdependence in the focal relationship was also hypothesised and tested. Findings suggest that firm innovativeness is positively associated with firm SCR, and supply uncertainty negatively moderates this relationship but interdependence does not. We argue that this could be due to the dual nature of interdependence in supply networks.",How does firm innovativeness enable supply chain resilience?

"© 2014 Taylor  &  Francis. Over the last few years, the fight against climate change has become one of the main topics of international debate. Hence, consumer behaviour has begun to change as they have started to assess the environmental impacts of the products and services they buy. Although various methods exist for measuring environmental (e.g. carbon) impacts, there is no international consensus about the most appropriate one. In addition, calculations can also be affected by limited data availability and uncertainty surrounding the value of key variables. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for measuring and analysing the carbon footprint in supply chains. This research contributes to the knowledge and practice of green supply chain management, at the corporate level, by providing robustness. This aids the decision-making process by identifying strategies in order to reach the efficiency that can be achieved by reducing CO2 emission over the supply network. The framework is validated using real data from a supply chain belonging to the agro-industrial sector. Finally, these results and experience is generalised in order to show the difficulties and challenges in the measuring task.",Conceptual framework for measuring carbon footprint in supply chains,agro-industry *** carbon footprint *** framework *** GHG protocol *** supply chain,production planning and control,84929504970,2015,,,,,,
"© 2015 Taylor  &  Francis. Decision-making in a supply chain is a key factor for meeting the strategic goals of an organisation. Customer demand is rapidly changing in todays turbulent environment, and organisation must be responsive enough to meet these changes. The responsiveness of the organisation incurs cost, and a trade-off between responsiveness and efficiency is necessary to meet organisation strategy for enabling competitive advantage. Information integration across the supply chain enables the network to respond quickly to continuously changing customer demand. The potential screened suppliers are evaluated in a dynamic environment using beer game simulation for limited and system-wide information availability. The simulation is run for stable and random orders to get results for varied inventory levels and bullwhip effect (order fluctuations). Thus, the selected and evaluated suppliers enabled prioritisation of the suppliers to meet the organisations strategic objectives. The results from the study suggested that the inventory level and bullwhip effect reduced significantly as a result of integrating the information for both stable and random orders. Thus, a robust framework is devised for long-term decision-making in enabling an organisation to meet its strategic objectives. The paper focuses on devising a structured methodology for supplier selection which is an important decision in a supply chain. After initial evaluation of potential suppliers, the decision-making involves selecting suppliers. The decision-making must fulfil the firm to be responsive to customer while also serving the purpose of cost efficiency. Thus, by properly tuning the information integration in a supply network, the methodology suitably quantifies the inventory levels and bull-whip effect for effective decision-making.",Impact of information integration on decision-making in a supply chain network,beer game simulation *** bull whip effect *** decision making *** inventory levels *** stable and random orders,production planning and control,84938416495,2015,,,,,,
"© 2015 © 2015 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press. The global economic structure, with its decentralized production and the consequent increase in freight traffic all over the world, creates considerable problems and challenges for the freight transport sector. This situation has led shipping to become the most suitable and cheapest way to transport goods. Thus, ports are configured as nodes with critical importance in the logistics supply chain as a link between two transport systems, sea and land. Increase in activity at seaports is producing three undesirable effects: increasing road congestion, lack of open space in port installations and a significant environmental impact on seaports. These adverse effects can be mitigated by moving part of the activity inland. Implementation of dry ports is a possible solution and would also provide an opportunity to strengthen intermodal solutions as part of an integrated and more sustainable transport chain, acting as a link between road and railway networks. In this sense, implementation of dry ports allows the separation of the links of the transport chain, thus facilitating the shortest possible routes for the lowest capacity and most polluting means of transport. Thus, the decision of where to locate a dry port demands a thorough analysis of the whole logistics supply chain, with the objective of transferring the largest volume of goods possible from road to more energy efficient means of transport, like rail or short-sea shipping, that are less harmful to the environment. However, the decision of where to locate a dry port must also ensure the sustainability of the site. Thus, the main goal of this article is to research the variables influencing the sustainability of dry port location and how this sustainability can be evaluated. With this objective, in this paper we present a methodology for assessing the sustainability of locations by the use of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and Bayesian Networks (BNs). MCDA is used as a way to establish a scoring, whilst BNs were chosen to eliminate arbitrariness in setting the weightings using a technique that allows us to prioritize each variable according to the relationships established in the set of variables. In order to determine the relationships between all the variables involved in the decision, giving us the importance of each factor and variable, we built a K2 BN algorithm. To obtain the scores of each variable, we used a complete cartography analysed by ArcGIS. Recognising that setting the most appropriate location to place a dry port is a geographical multidisciplinary problem, with significant economic, social and environmental implications, we consider 41 variables (grouped into 17 factors) which respond to this need. As a case of study, the sustainability of all of the 10 existing dry ports in Spain has been evaluated. In this set of logistics platforms, we found that the most important variables for achieving sustainability are those related to environmental protection, so the sustainability of the locations requires a great respect for the natural environment and the urban environment in which they are framed.",How should the sustainability of the location of dry ports be measured?

This work aims to identify key antecedents of SCM in a project-based environment by using Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM). This is firstly useful in order to highlight the relationships among the antecedents and to deduce priority for their achievement. The findings provide a hierarchical perspective of the 16 identified antecedents. In particular, three macro-classes of prerequisites were defined: cross-organizational cooperation, rules and procedures - accessibility, and super-ordinate goals. Moreover, results from a longitudinal and illustrative case study are also presented in order to compare the out-coming ISM model with evidence from a success case in the Yacht-building context so offering interesting insights about the implementation process. From a managerial perspective, the proposed model offers a conceptual path for SCM adoption, emphasizing most critical issues that have to be considered and organized in this complex and unpredictable setting.",Key antecedents and practices for supply chain management adoption in project contexts,Adoption path *** Case study *** Interpretive structural modelling *** Project-based environments *** SCM antecedents,international journal of project management,84930759666,2015,,,,,,

Recent work has focused on developing and simulating such alternative processes from integrated biomass/natural gas and biomass/coal feedstocks to produce fuels and chemicals. These process simulations provide invaluable information on the performance and capability of the specific process alternative considered. However, the development of many alternative technologies, along with multiple feedstock and product possibilities, made the superstructure based optimization methods the natural approaches to be pursued. These process superstructures can be efficiently optimized to provide insights into topological, economic, and environmental trade-offs by simultaneously weighing the strengths and weaknesses of each alternative. Despite the development of these powerful tools, several outstanding challenges need to be systematically addressed. These challenges include the implementation of different conversion technologies and feedstock types, investigating the production of a superset of fuels and chemicals, systematically addressing price uncertainties for robust refinery designs, and synthesizing a supply network optimization to potentially displace the petroleum demand. This perspective article reviews the current work on integrated biomass/natural gas and biomass/coal refineries, highlights the major advances in these fields, and discusses future directions.",Integrated biomass and fossil fuel systems towards the production of fuels and chemicals: State of the art approaches and future challenges, ,current opinion in chemical engineering,84941053179,2015,,,,,,
"© 2015 Elsevier B.V. Assessing water supply sustainability is crucial to meet stakeholders' needs, notably in the Mediterranean. This region has been identified as a climate change hot spot, and as a region where water demand is continuously increasing due to population growth and the expansion of irrigated areas. The Hérault River catchment (2500km2, France) is a typical example and a negative trend in discharge has been observed since the 1960s. In this context, local stakeholders need to evaluate possible future changes in water allocation capacity in the catchment, using climate change, dam management and water use scenarios. A modelling framework that was already calibrated and validated on this catchment over the last 50years was used to assess whether water resources could meet water demands at the 2030 horizon for the domestic, agricultural and environmental sectors. Water supply sustainability was evaluated at the sub-basin scale according to priority allocations using a water supply capacity index, frequency of unsatisfactory years as well as the reliability, resilience and sustainability metrics. Water use projections were based on the evolution of population, per-unit water demand, irrigated areas, water supply network efficiency, as well as on the evaluation of a biological flow. Climate projections were based on an increase in temperature up to 2°C and a decrease in daily precipitation by 20%. Adaptation strategies considered reducing per-unit water demand for the domestic sector and the importation of water volume for the agricultural sector. The dissociated effects of water use and climatic constraints on water supply sustainability were evaluated. Results showed that the downstream portions would be the more impacted as they are the most exploited ones. In the domestic sector, sustainability indicators would be more degraded by climate change scenarios than water use constraints. In the agricultural sector the negative impact of water use scenarios would be stronger. The environmental sector would be hardly satisfied especially in summer with low resilience levels. The adaptation strategies considered in this study would not be sufficient to cope with both anthropogenic and climate changes. Other strategies were discussed based on known examples in the Mediterranean context.",Water supply sustainability and adaptation strategies under anthropogenic and climatic changes of a meso-scale Mediterranean catchment,Climate variability *** Integrated modelling *** Prospective scenarios *** River Hérault *** Sustainability indicators *** Water uses,science of the total environment,84940369163,2015,,,,,,
"© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. Supply network resilience is an emerging concept related to the ability of a network to tolerate disruptions; current understanding of its meaning and dimensions, its role in the design and operation of supply networks, and its relation to sustainability is at its early stages. Existing approaches are based on the trade-off between increased resources and higher fault-tolerance. The Fault Tolerance by Teaming (FTT) principle of Collaborative Control Theory has been applied in sensor networks effectively and appears as a promising original approach not based on the aforementioned trade-off and capable of producing networks with higher resilience. Inspired by the FTT principle, a Resilience by Teaming Framework (RBT) for supply networks is developed to address the design and operation of resilient supply networks. RBT is tested and validated through the application of its protocols to case studies in production and distribution networks. Evidence from case studies' results suggests that through FTT-based protocols and RBT it is possible to achieve higher fault tolerance with fewer resources than under traditional approaches.",A resilience by teaming framework for collaborative supply networks,Collaborative Control Theory *** Fault-Tolerance by Teaming *** Sensor networks *** Supply Chain Management *** Sustainability,computers and industrial engineering,84941893742,2015,,,,,,

This paper investigates the relationship between learning and adaptation in supply chains located within industrial districts, with the aim of identifying the best adaptive supply chain. It is motivated by the increasing attention that the design of adaptive supply chains has been receiving in recent years, as it is considered one of the most important critical factors in gaining sustainable competitive advantage in the current hypercompetitive environment. Focusing on two learning processes (i.e., by imitation and by interacting), diverse types of adaptive supply chains recognizable within industrial districts are compared by means of an agent-based simulation on the basis of their adaptive performance in environments characterized by different level of complexity and turbulence. The results confirm that the supply chain type influences the relationship between learning and adaptation and that both the product complexity and the turbulence of the environment moderate this effect. Finally, the best adaptive supply chain in each type of context is identified.",Adaptive supply chains in industrial districts: A complexity science approach focused on learning,Adaptation *** Adaptive supply chains *** Industrial district *** Learning *** NK simulation,international journal of production economics,84959184478,2015,,,,,,
"© 2015, Galli et al. Over the 2000s’, consumers’ food purchases have been increasingly informed by supply chain-related issues, with growing concerns about the sustainability of chains differing for their geographical scope. As a result, short food supply chains and local food systems have risen to policymakers and food chain stakeholders’ attention as more sustainable alternatives to mainstream food networks. However, associating food chain’s geographical scope and sustainability performance may not be straightforward. This paper aims at shedding lights on the connection between geographical scope and sustainability by comparing and discussing 19 attributes owing to different sustainability dimensions. The analysis anchors on the wheat-to-bread chain, due to its global relevance. Bread is a worldwide staple food and wheat is (generally) a commodity traded globally. However, wheat processing often occurs locally and baking is influenced by local heritage and consumption patterns, particularly in the EU and in Italy, where gastronomy is culturally embedded. The paper identifies critical aspects and provides a qualitative assessment of the performances of local vs global wheat-to-bread chains. The assessment is carried out on Italian case studies.",Sustainability assessment of food supply chains: an application to local and global bread in Italy,Bread *** Food supply chain *** Global *** Local *** Sustainability assessment,agricultural and food economics,85018500902,2015,,,,,,
"© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. Pallets are currently the most widespread system for internal material handling and logistics of goods through a supply chain: they represent a critical asset for all firms, especially for Logistics Service Providers (LSPs). Analyzing pallet management systems according to a logistics point of view is quite a new research trend. Open or closed loop networks are now applied worldwide for pallet logistics: the latter is more complex to design and manage due to the presence of a reverse logistics process; several inbound and outbound processes have to be assessed. On the other hand, closed loop systems are the most effective, both from an environmental and an economic point of views. The aim of the paper is to outline critical factors (such as the pallet logistics network, the interchange system) in designing closed loop pallet management systems; a simulation-based tool has been developed in order to support logistic managers in designing effective organizational scenarios for these systems. Cost and time based KPIs will be estimated by the simulation model. A case study about a LSP firm has been also analyzed in order to validate the proposed model. A sensitivity analysis has been carried out aiming to evaluate impacts on supply chain performance due to context parameters. The proposed study could support both practitioners and academics in better understanding the key management aspects involved in closed loop pallet management, thus allowing a most effective design of this critical reverse logistics system.",Designing an effective closed loop system for pallet management,Closed loop *** Discrete-event simulation *** Logistic service provider *** Pallet management *** Reverse logistics *** Scenario analysis,international journal of production economics,84962422566,2015,,,,,,
"© 2015, AESS. The twenty-first century challenges of climate change and resource scarcity bring a new urgency to the widely recognized sustainability challenges of the US food system. Environmental and social impacts associated with the geographic concentration and specialization in production, processing, and distribution that accompanied industrialization of the US food system have degraded our nation’s capacity to adapt to changing climate conditions. A consensus is emerging in sustainable food system scholarship that two fundamental changes—a transformation of production methods from industrial to sustainable and a transformation of food system geography from regional specialization to regional diversity—should enhance the resilience of the food system to climate change. A review of the literature suggests that transition to a nationally integrated network of sustainable metropolitan food systems (“metropolitan foodsheds”) would improve climate resilience by enhancing three key qualities associated with resilience in social-ecological systems—diversity, modularity, and balanced accumulation of capital assets. These qualities promote the capacity of a system to respond, to recover, and to transform in ways that reduce damaging effects and take advantage of opportunities created by change. Using a set of behavior-based resilience indicators in a review of case study research, this article examines the general resilience of sustainable production and supply chain systems. Sustainable production systems managed by award-winning sustainable food producers expressed all of the behaviors of a resilient system and demonstrated remarkable resilience to weather variability and extremes. These producers attributed the climate resilience of their farms and ranches to high-quality soils, planned biodiversity, and diversified marketing. Like many sustainable producers, these farmers and ranchers not only produce crops and livestock, they also participate in processing, distribution, and retailing. Resilient behavior was also expressed in sustainable supply chains developed by networked community cooperatives and through government investment in a large nonprofit food terminal. As recent food system planning projects in the USA illustrate, there is growing recognition of the potential sustainability and resilience benefits of regional food systems designed to develop positive relationships between the metropolitan core and surrounding areas. We can begin now to shift public support for a transition to more diversified production, to develop regional food system infrastructure, and to conduct comprehensive research to refine resilience indicators and develop food system performance metrics to guide a transformation of the US food system to a more sustainable and resilient future.",Metropolitan foodsheds: a resilient response to the climate change challenge?,Agriculture *** City region *** Climate change *** Food system *** Megaregions *** Metropolitan foodshed *** Resilience *** Sustainability,journal of environmental studies and sciences,84977118133,2015,,,,,,
"© 2015, AESS. This article explores problems and solutions in the New England groundfish fishery, where social, economic, environmental, and food system sustainability are major challenges. With industrialization of fishing during the past century, managers have turned a blind eye to issues of scale (e.g., industrial scale vs. community scale), which has led to chronic overfishing. There have been recurring stock collapses of favored species (e.g., cod) during the past 50 years despite federal government management of the fishery during most of that period. Small- and medium-scale fishermen—with better local knowledge, motivation for local sustainability, and smaller ecological footprints—have increasingly been displaced by large-scale operations, especially during recent years with policies that are privatizing fisheries access and consolidating the fleet. Coastal fishing communities and the fishery have suffered. The Fish Locally Collaborative (FLC)—an international decentralized network of fishermen and their allies—is promoting a paradigm shift. Its efforts to keep the smaller-scale boats afloat and support local communities include economic and political strategies. Defining value with quadruple bottom line accounting (i.e., assessing social, economic, environmental, and food system impacts), the FLC promotes a shift from high-volume/low-value production to low volume/high value. The FLC has reestablished local food supply chains with community-supported fisheries, public seafood markets, and “boat-to-hospital” and “boat-to-school” programs based on procurement contracts that specify local and sustainable catch. FLC participants promote the consumption of lesser-known fish species to motivate more balanced and ecologically sustainable fishing. Politically, FLC participants continue to build the strength of the network and engage in policy discussions at local, national, and international levels.",Promoting resilience in a regional seafood system: New England and the Fish Locally Collaborative,Catch shares *** Cod *** Community-supported fisheries *** Fish Locally Collaborative *** Fisheries *** New England *** Regional fisheries council *** Resilience *** Sutainability,journal of environmental studies and sciences,84977151226,2015,,,,,,
"© 2015, AESS. This paper lays out the relationships between three mutually reinforcing concepts associated with agroecosystems: (1) agroecosystem health, the extent to which an agroecosystem can meet human needs for all of its residents over time; (2) resilience, the capacity of a system to adapt, reorganize, and maintain key functions in the face of turbulent and unpredictable change in its environment; (3) food security, sufficient quantity and quality of food for everyone at all times. Agroecosystem health has been defined by a number of properties including the following: stability, sustainability, equitability, productivity, and autonomy, each in the context of specific spatial and temporal scales. Indicators that characterize biophysical and social conditions including soil health, biodiversity, topography, farm economics, land economics, and social organization can be combined using analytical hierarchy process to map agroecosystem health across a landscape. The resulting map may provide incentive and guidance for improving the conditions underlying agroecosystem health. Resilience and agroecosystem health overlap largely because both rely on diversity, in biological and physical as well as human cultural, social, and economic terms. The Agroecosystems Management Program at The Ohio State University has approached research and outreach to improve agroecosystem health, resilience, and food security by encouraging self-organizing social networks for economic development around local and regional agricultural supply chains, encouraging farm enterprise diversity at a wider range of farming scales, and conducting research to monitor and estimate the benefits of such diversification. Social media tools have been explored for connecting entrepreneurs at the planning stage, with the ultimate goal of improving the economic support for more diversified enterprises in agroecosystems. Although challenging, such adaptive management experiments may create and encourage new opportunities for managing agroecosystem health, and with it, resilient food production and security.","Agroecosystem health, agroecosystem resilience, and food security",Biodiversity *** Crop diversity *** Enterprise diversity *** Entrepreneurship *** Self-organization *** Sustainable agriculture,journal of environmental studies and sciences,84977139243,2015,,,,,,
"That supply chain management and logistics are a determining factor for the long term success of a company was well documented by Forrester over a half century ago [1], with the importance of the statement only growing through the intervening years. Whether consciously factored into the operating mode or not, logistics and distribution channel management plays a critical role in the life, and death, of a firm. From the rudimentary beginnings of the start-up company to the hectic world of the growth company and onto the relatively secure existence in mature markets, the value chain consisting of logistics and distribution channel linkages follows the firm, until it solidifies into immutable form of the mature value chain and begins to exert an inexorable pressure on the survival of the entire chain, and conversely the chain imposes its will on the members. The emergence of mature industry value chains is often driven by the need to monopolistically control logistics and distribution channels which provides a competitive advantage but also introduces a serious exposure to pending shock loadings of the chain.",Risk profiles along the lifecycle in dynamic markets,Business process *** Complexity *** Life cycle *** Organizational factors *** Risk,management and production engineering review,84953276241,2015,,,,,,
"© World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine 2015. Background When disaster strikes, the number of patients requiring treatment can be overwhelming. In low-income countries, resources to assist the injured in a timely fashion may be limited. As a consequence, necrosis and wound infection in disaster patients is common and frequently leads to adverse health outcomes such as amputations, chronic wounds, and loss of life. In such compromised health care environments, low-tech and cheap wound care options are required that are in ready supply, easy to use, and have multiple therapeutic benefits. Maggot debridement therapy (MDT) is one such wound care option and may prove to be an invaluable tool in the treatment of wounds post-disaster. Discussion This report provides an overview of the wound burden experienced in various types of disaster, followed by a discussion of current treatment approaches, and the role MDT may play in the treatment of complex wounds in challenging health care conditions. Maggot debridement therapy removes necrotic and devitalized tissue, controls wound infection, and stimulates wound healing. These properties suggest that medicinal maggots could assist health care professionals in the debridement of disaster wounds, to control or prevent infection, and to prepare the wound bed for reconstructive surgery. Maggot debridement therapy-assisted wound care would be led by health care workers rather than physicians, which would allow the latter to focus on reconstructive and other surgical interventions. Moreover, MDT could provide a larger window for time-critical interventions, such as fasciotomies to treat compartment syndrome and amputations in case of life-threatening wound infection. Recommendations There are social, medical, and logistic hurdles to overcome before MDT can become widely available in disaster medical aid. Thus, research is needed to further demonstrate the utility of MDT in Disaster Medicine. There is also a need for reliable MDT logistics and supply chain networks. Integration with other disaster management activities will also be essential. Conclusions In the aftermath of disasters, MDT could play an important role facilitating timely and efficient medical treatment and improving patient outcomes. Existing social, medical, and logistic barriers will need to be overcome for MDT to be mainstreamed in Disaster Medicine.

"© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Crude oil supply chain is extremely complex and vulnerable to various risks. Clear understanding of these risks can help supply chain managers to make effective decisions.

The results show that the most important risk area is the regulatory and environmental risks and that the transference and cooperation policy is rated as the best response strategy. Contributions of this paper are fourfold: (1) it provides a comprehensive framework of risks that need to be considered in crude oil supply chain risk management (SCRM) context; (2) it shows how DEMATEL can be applied to analyze the interdependency between risks; (3) it illustrates how various risks and risk management strategies can been assessed through the ANP approach to aid managers in their decision making processes; and (4) most important contribution is customization of crude oil SCRM in Iran.",Crude oil supply chain risk management with DEMATEL–ANP,Analytic network process (ANP) *** Crude oil supply chain *** DEMATEL *** Supply chain risk management (SCRM),operational research,84945494691,2015,,,,,,

We have developed a model using robust optimization based on three well-known robust counterpart optimization formulations. Finally, this paper compares the results of the three formulations using different test scenarios and parameter-sensitive analysis in terms of final output, CPU time, the level of conservatism, the degree of closeness to the ideal solution, the degree of balance involved in developing a compromise solution, and satisfaction degree. Two further questions related to environmental dimensions and social dimensions have been investigated using an appreciative inquiry, a quasi-ethnographic study. In this way, we have embraced mixed research design to address our research questions.

"© 2015, AESS. The Australian food system is often assumed to be largely secure in the face of global environmental challenges such as climate change. In 2010/2011, serious flooding in Queensland left towns isolated, major roads and highways cut and incurred significant loss of life and property. In terms of food security, large areas of agricultural land were inundated, and food supply chains, including both long and short chains, were affected in significant ways. The impacts included increases in food prices; deterioration in food quality; reduced consumer access to food; and disruption to the sourcing, transportation and distribution of food, grocery and other items. Examining the discourses and policies surrounding food supply during and after the floods, this paper asks, what lessons for building a more resilient food system have emerged from the 2011 floods? To explore this question, we consider policy documents, media reports, interviews and fieldwork with key stakeholders. We find evidence of strong collaboration of state government and long supply chain operators, but to the general exclusion of civil society-based food chains. Long chains provide the vast bulk of food to Queensland consumers but are vulnerable when roads are cut; civic agriculture showed resilience but remained marginal to the food needs of most Queensland consumers. Both resilience and vulnerability were present within both long and short food supply chains. Yet, there is limited evidence that food security issues, beyond productivity enhancement, are being considered in discussions and policies for climate change and natural disasters. We suggest that a broader view of climate change, beyond disasters and food production, has yet to be fully integrated into food security policy—and supply chain governance and practice—in Australia.","Connecting resilience, food security and climate change: lessons from flooding in Queensland, Australia",Alternative food networks *** Disasters *** Food supply chains *** Governance *** Resilience *** Supermarkets,journal of environmental studies and sciences,84977103744,2015,,,,,,
"© 2015, AESS. The climate change vulnerability of a food system is a function of the exposure of the system to specific climate effects, the sensitivity of the system to those effects, and the capacity of the system adapt to those effects in order to maintain system integrity. A synthesis of recent literature conducted to explore the vulnerability of the US food system to climate change suggests that the interaction between regional climate change effects and the geographic specialization and concentration of agricultural production in the USA increases the vulnerability of the US food system to climate change. Vegetable and fruit production in the Pacific states are particularly sensitive to reduced water supplies, warmer winters, and more variable spring weather. Grain production in the Great Plains and the Midwest is sensitive to more variable weather, warmer winters, heat wave, and hot summer nights and flooding caused by more frequent heavy rains. The concentration of beef, pork, and poultry production in confined animal feeding operations located in the southern Great Plains and the Southeast is particularly sensitive to increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather and interruptions in feed, water, and power supplies associated with interactions between land, water, and energy use that amplify climate change effects. There is evidence that climate change is already causing disruptions throughout the US food system. Farmers and ranchers in the US report that increased weather variability and more frequent and intense weather extremes have increased the costs and complexity of food production. Businesses operating in the US agricultural supply, processing, distribution, and retailing sectors are actively managing supply networks to reduce disruptions associated with climate change effects. Food systems that rely on external or distant resources and specialized production, supply, and marketing chains appear to be particularly vulnerable to global environmental change. These characteristics, widely recognized as critical challenges to the sustainability of the US food system, take on new importance as barriers to climate resilience.",The vulnerability of the US food system to climate change,Adaptive capacity *** Agricultural production *** Climate change *** Food systems *** Resilience *** Vulnerability,journal of environmental studies and sciences,84977151169,2015,,,,,,
"© The Author(s) 2015. For most of the last half century, economic concepts of efficiency have dominated antitrust law and competition policy. Debates have largely centered around how to apply these concepts to specific types of business conduct, for example, whether a particular merger is efficient or a particular action will exclude equally efficient competitors from the market, while concerns about market structure have largely receded into the background. Business scholarship and practice, however, have begun to place an increasing emphasis on sustainability. Sustainability not only challenges the basic assumption of efficiency analysis that firms rationally pursue profit maximization, sustainability also suggests that overreliance on efficiency may be a trap that renders markets less resilient and more prone to collapse in the face of abrupt changes. Growing concern about the fragility of supply chain networks provides a case in point. To avoid the efficiency trap requires consideration of both efficiency and resilience.","Avoiding the efficiency trap: Resilience, sustainability, and antitrust",AAI *** Antitrust *** Efficiency *** Sustainability,antitrust bulletin,85070873822,2015,,,,,,

Firstly, a discrete T-S fuzzy model of the dynamic supply chain network with uncertainties of the system parameters and the customers' demands is established. Then, a new fuzzy robust control strategy is proposed, and this control strategy can not only effective reduce the large fluctuation among subsystems in the switching processes, but also suppress the effect on the supply chain network caused by uncertainties. Therefore, under this control strategy, the supply chain network can operate robustly stable in the uncertain environment. Finally, a simulation example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy robust control strategy.",Fuzzy robust control of uncertain dynamic supply chain network system based on switched inventory,Fuzzy system *** Robust control *** Supply chain network *** Switched inventory *** Uncertainty,kongzhi yu juece/control and decision,84936760170,2015,,,,,,
"© 2015 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) has become a very useful initiative for industries to improve their environmental capabilities in terms of, reducing resources consumption and ensuring sustainable production in business. However, the effectiveness of Green Supply Chain (GSC) is comparatively low, as there has been a substantial amount of risk involved in managing GSC efficiently. In this contribution, therefore, we aim to identify and prioritize/rank the responses of risks in a GSC context. It would be useful for industries to focus on highly ranked responses and formulate strategies to practice them in accordance with their priority for managing the consequences of risks in GSC. The present research seeks to propose a model by using the fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and fuzzy Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods to prioritize the responses in GSC to manage its risks under the fuzzy environment. The fuzzy AHP is useful in deciding the importance weights of the related GSC risks. While, by using the fuzzy TOPSIS, the priority/ranking of the responses in a successful accomplishment of green initiatives is determined. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, the GSCM real-world case of an Indian poly-plastic manufacturing company is presented. The model proposed would offer a scientific analytic means to the managers/business professionals/practitioners for systematic implementation of the responses of risks relevant to adoption and effective implementation of green initiatives in business. A sensitivity analysis test has also been performed that monitors the robustness of the proposed network model.",Prioritizing the responses to manage risks in green supply chain: An Indian plastic manufacturer perspective,Fuzzy AHP *** Fuzzy TOPSIS *** Green supply chain management *** Resources consumption *** Risk responses *** Sustainable production,sustainable production and consumption,84944070812,2015,,,,,,

On the other hand, robust optimization approach is a powerful technique for handling problems faced with various environmental uncertainties. This paper combines these two concepts and proposes a method to evaluate SCs performance.

"© Emerald Group Publishing Limited. Purpose – The purpose of this technical viewpoint is to provide a commentary of how we went about using logistics prototyping as a method to engage citizens, science fiction (SF) writers and small- to medium- sized enterprises (SME’s). Six urban logistic prototypes built on the themes of future cities, community resilience and urban supply chain management (SCM) are summarized, together with details of the data collection procedure and the methodological challenges encountered. Our investigation aimed to explore the potential of logistics prototyping to develop “user-driven” and “SME” approaches to future city design and urban supply chain decision-making. Design/methodology/approach – This Boston field experiment was a case study investigation conducted between May and August 2013. Qualitative data was collected using a “mixed-method” approach combining together focus groups (MIT faculty), scenarios, prototyping workshops, interviews and document analysis. These story-creators could use the prototype method as a way of testing their hypotheses, theories and constrained speculations with regard to specified future city and urban supply chain scenarios. Findings – This viewpoint suggests that the prototyping method allows for unique individual perspectives on future city planning and urban supply chain design. This work also attempts to demonstrate that prototyping can create sufficiently cogent environments for future city and urban SCM theories to be both detected and analysed therein. Although this is an experimental field of the SCM theory building, more conventional theories could also be “tested” in the same manner. Research limitations/implications – By embedding logistics prototyping within a mixed method approach, we might be criticized as constraining its capability to map out the future – that its potential to be flexible and imaginative are held back by the equal weighting given to the more conventional component. In basing our case study within one city then this might be seen as limiting the complexity of the empirical context – however, the situation within different cities is inherently complex. Case studies also attract criticism on the grounds of not being representative; in this situation, they might be criticized as imperfect indicators of what transpires in other situations. However, this technical viewpoint suggests that in spite of its limitations, prototyping facilitates an imaginative and creative approach to theory generation and concept building. Practical implications – The methodology allows everyday citizens and SME’s to develop user-driven foresight and planning scenarios with city strategists’ and urban logistic designers. It facilitates much broader stakeholder involvement in city and urban supply chain policymaking, than current “quantitative” approaches. Social implications – Logistics fiction prototyping provides a democratic approach to future city planning and urban supply chain design. It involves collectively imagining socio-technical futures and second-order sociological effects through the writing of SF narratives or building “design fictions”. Originality/value – Decision-making in future cities and urban SCM is often a notable challenge, balancing the varying needs and claims of multiple stakeholders, while negotiating an acceptable trade-off between their competing claims. Engagement with stakeholders and active encouragement of stakeholder participation in the supply chain aspects of future cities is increasingly a feature of twenty-first century social decision-making. This viewpoint suggests that the prototyping method allows for unique individual perspectives on future city planning and urban supply chain design. This work also attempts to demonstrate that prototyping can create sufficiently cogent environments for future city and the urban SCM theories to be both detected and analysed therein. Although this is an experimental field of SCM theory building, more conventional theories could also be “tested” in the same manner.",Exploring future cityscapes through urban logistics prototyping: A technical viewpoint,Green supply chains *** Innovation *** Logistics *** Operations planning *** Operations strategy *** Sustainability,supply chain management,84946169759,2015,,,,,,
"© 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Implementing comprehensive service contracts and sustainable supply chains are two recent trends that create the opportunity to develop maintenance contracts with an uptime guarantee for the customer and a remanufacturing process for removed parts. This involves management decisions on the design of the contract (price, uptime guarantee and overhaul interval) and the logistics network (facility locations, capacities and inventories with given service level). These two decision levels are interrelated: the number of contracts is a function of price and machine uptime, while this uptime is affected by the overhaul interval and network responsiveness. Steady-state queueing equations explicitly model the stochastic nature of the problem, e.g. the impact of resource utilization levels on lead time of the remanufacturing process. This approach results in a non-linear mixed integer model, which is solved by a differential evolution algorithm to find the maximum profit that simultaneously optimizes both problems. A real-life application reveals that price sensitivity is a critical determinant and that measures must be taken to tackle the problem of moral hazard.",Network and contract optimization for maintenance services with remanufacturing,Contract design *** Network design *** Queueing *** Remanufacturing,computers and operations research,84912076969,2015,,,,,,

"© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. This study identifies the critical factors influencing the adoption of green supply chain practices in Chinese firms. The participating firms were classified into focal, downstream, and upstream firms. The data set was grouped in two namely aggregate which includes all the firms and independent data which consists of each firm's classification. Partial Least Squares (PLS) method was used to identify the determinants of green practices. The aggregate data show that external environmental factors (including customer pressures, regulatory pressures, government supports, and environmental uncertainty) were the most important in adopting green practices. For the focal firms, the independent data show that relative advantage, quality of human resources and customer pressure are positively associated with the adoption of green practice and they positively influence operations systems' performance. Conversely, the downstream firms are more efficient and effective when there are organizational and governmental supports. For upstream firms, the critical factors to organizational performance are compatibility, customer and regulatory pressures. In both the downstream and upstream firms, the factor complexity which denotes the lack of understanding and learning of green practices is the key barrier to implementing green practices. Knowledge of these critical factors for green supply chain management practice would help Chinese firms to become more environmentally responsible while simultaneously achieving their operational performance goals.",Determinants and associated performance improvement of green supply chain management in China,Corporate performance *** Determinant factors *** Green supply chain,journal of cleaner production,84927174578,2015,,,,,,
"© 2015 Taylor  &  Francis. Increasing trend in global business integration and movement of material around the world has caused supply chain system susceptible to disruption involving higher risks. This paper presents a methodology for supplier selection in a global sourcing environment by considering multiple cost and risk factors. Failure modes and effects analysis technique from reliability engineering field and Bayesian belief networks are used to quantify the risk posed by each factor. The probability and the cost of each risk are then incorporated into a decision tree model to compute the total expected costs for each supply option. The supplier selection decision is made based on the total purchasing costs including both deterministic costs (such as product and transportation costs) and the risk-associated costs. The proposed approach is demonstrated using an example of a US-based Chemical distributor. This framework provides a visual tool for supply chain managers to see how cost and risks are distributed across the different alternatives. Lastly, managers can calculate expected value of perfect information to avoid a certain risk.",Bayesian belief network-based framework for sourcing risk analysis during supplier selection,Bayesian belief network *** decision tree *** global sourcing *** strategic supplier selection,international journal of production research,84938987453,2015,,,,,,
"Copyright © 2015, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l. During the last decade, as the overexploitation and scarcity of the global natural water resources have led to a plethora of negative environmental, social and economic impacts, the preservation of freshwater resources has emerged as a major challenge for governmental authorities, businesses and consumers. To that effect, the concept of water footprint (WF) has been introduced at a national, corporate and product level. Since national WFs are obtained mainly from agricultural production and food manufacturing or processing operations, WF assessment and management are considered to be of utmost importance for the agrifood industry. In this context, several agrifood companies map the WF of their supply chain networks as a part of their corporate social responsibility programmes. In this manuscript, we first review the scientific literature and several real-world corporate sustainability reports and we then provide a critical taxonomy of management policies that mitigate the water WF at each echelon of an agrifood supply chain (AFSC). Following that, a firsteffort System Dynamics (SD) model that effectively captures the dynamics of the WF and water scarcity along the entire supply chains of agrifood products is developed. The obtained simulation results reveal the need for responsible freshwater management across AFSCs in order to reduce the total WF and to further create a green corporate image. The literature taxonomy along with the proposed SD modelling approach is anticipated to provide value-added managerial insights with respect to corporate policy-making interventions towards the sustainable development of the agrifood sector.",Water footprint management policies for agrifood supply chains: A critical taxonomy and a system dynamics modelling approach, ,chemical engineering transactions,84946100762,2015,,,,,,
"© 2015 Yongchang Wei et al. A supply chain network might exhibit complex dynamics in the face of increasingly volatile and uncertain environment. The impact of network structure and collaboration on the dynamics and robustness of supply chain network, however, remains to be explored. In this paper, a unified state space model for a two-layer supply chain network composed of multiple distributors and multiple retailers is developed. A robust control algorithm is advocated to reduce both order and demand fluctuations for unknown demand. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the robust control approach has the advantage to reduce both inventory and order fluctuations. In the simulation experiment, it is interesting to notice that complex network structure and collaborations might contribute to the reduction of inventory and order oscillations.

"© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. Each year, more than 400 natural disasters hit the world. To be more responsive, humanitarians organize stocks of relief items. It is an issue to know the quantity of items to be stored and where they should be positioned. Many authors have tried to address this issue both in industrial and humanitarian environments. However, humanitarian supply chains today do not perform correctly, particularly as regards resilience and efficiency. This is mainly due to the fact that when a disaster occurs, some hazards can strongly impact the network by destroying some resources or collapsing infrastructure. The expected performance of the relief response is consequently strongly decreased. The problem statement of our research work consists in proposing a decision-making support model in artificial intelligence dedicated to the humanitarian world and capable of designing a coherent network that is still able to adequately manage the response to a disaster despite failures or inadequacies of infrastructure and potential resources. This contribution is defined through a Stochastic Multi-Scenarios Program as a core and a set of extensions.

"© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Sustainability has been considered as a growing concern in supply chain network design (SCND) and in the order allocation problem (OAP). Accordingly, there still exists a gap in the quantitative modeling of sustainable SCND that consists of OAP. In this article, we cover this gap through simultaneously considering the sustainable OAP in the sustainable SCND as a strategic decision. The proposed supply chain network is composed of five echelons including suppliers classified in different classes, plants, distribution centers that dispatch products via two different ways, direct shipment, and cross-docks, to satisfy stochastic demand received from a set of retailers. The problem has been mathematically formulated as a multi-objective optimization model that aims at minimizing the total costs and environmental effect of integrating SCND and OAP, simultaneously. To tackle the addressed problem, a novel multi-objective hybrid approach called MOHEV with two strategies for its best particle selection procedure (BPSP), minimum distance, and crowding distance is proposed. MOHEV is constructed through hybridization of two multi-objective algorithms, namely the adapted multi-objective electromagnetism mechanism algorithm (AMOEMA) and adapted multi-objective variable neighborhood search (AMOVNS). According to achieved results, MOHEV achieves better solutions compared with the others, and also crowding distance method for BPSP outperforms minimum distance. Finally, a case study for an automobile industry is used to demonstrate the applicability of the approach.",Bi-objective integrating sustainable order allocation and sustainable supply chain network strategic design with stochastic demand using a novel robust hybrid multi-objective metaheuristic,Greenhouse gas emissions *** Multi-objective optimization *** Robust metaheuristic *** Stochastic demand *** Supply chain network design *** Sustainability,computers and operations research,84937973126,2015,,,,,,
"© 2013 Pion and its Licensors. Supply chains provide the critical infrastructure for the production and distribution of goods and services in our network economy and serve as the conduits for the manufacturing, transportation, and consumption of products ranging from food, clothing, automobiles, and high-technology products, to healthcare products. Cities as major population centers serve not only as the principal demand points but also as the locations of many of the distribution and storage facilities, transportation providers, and even manufacturers. In this paper a new model is developed for the design of sustainable supply chains with a focus on cities that captures the frequency of network link operations, which is especially relevant to cities due to frequent freight deliveries. The model is also related to recent literature on this subject. The goal is to demonstrate how, through the proper design (and operation) of these complex networks, waste can be reduced, along with the environmental impacts, while minimizing operational and frequency costs, and meeting demand.",Design of sustainable supply chains for sustainable cities,Multicriteria decision-making *** Network design *** Optimization *** Supply chains *** Sustainability *** Sustainable cities,environment and planning b: planning and design,84922794534,2015,,,,,,
"© 2015 Shaheen Sardar and Young Hae Lee. Outsourcing in the textile industry has been playing an important role in the global economy for six decades. Recently, reshoring is an emerging trend due to various complexities involved in supply chain management. As compared with basic textile and apparel products, fast fashion products are complex in their own way. A single assortment contains several new styles, colors, and sizes with unpredictable demand and urgent deadlines. Numerous assortments run simultaneously in the supply chain. For each assortment, the garment manufacturer has to source various types of fabrics and materials from different suppliers and then manufacture the garments to ship within the deadlines. This complexity contributes to supply chain disruption. This paper develops a model to estimate supply chain disruption cost as a function of fast fashion product complexity in the global outsourcing environment. Estimation of disruption cost will help us to increase visibility and eliminate the bottlenecks in supply chain. Model conclusions are used to develop a method to manage the level of product complexity from the global supply chain perspective. Several strategies are proposed to manage the impact of product complexity on supply chain design.",Analysis of Product Complexity considering Disruption Cost in Fast Fashion Supply Chain, ,mathematical problems in engineering,84938151214,2015,,,,,,

The 2011 Tohoku Earthquake damaged severely and extensively a large geographical area and caused devastating disruptions to the industrial supply chains in Japan. This paper focuses on a case of supply disruption of the automotive microcontroller units, which were produced by Renesas Electronics and supplied to Toyota via its first tier vendors like Denso. The first purpose of this paper is to describe, from a supply chain management view point, what happened and what actions these companies took, and to understand why it took three months for Toyota to recover to its pre-earthquake production level. Since many things happened, we apply a framework of SCM hierarchy to analyze the issues from the perspective of execution, design, strategy and sustainability. The second purpose is to identify based on this case analysis what functions are missing in the supply chain coordination mechanism of Toyota Production System, where the coordination is propagating from Toyota to upstream suppliers through the close interaction between the successive layers of its multi-layered supplier network. This case analysis implies that direct control functions need to be added to alleviate the disruption risk and secure the supply of key parts and materials.

"© Emerald Group Publishing Limited. Purpose - Collaboration in supply chain networks (SCN) becomes extremely important for manufacturers seeking a sustainable competitive advantage. Such competitiveness depends on the SCN resources a manufacturing firm can allocate, the capabilities to identify and deploy these network resources effectively, and practices and applications the firm arranges for these resources. The purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework that investigates the relationships between these network constructs and their influences on firm performance. Design/methodology/approach - An extensive literature review of supply chain management was conducted to explicate why some manufacturers outperform others. A resource-based view, dynamic capability theory, and extended resource-based view were employed to develop a conceptual model that investigates relationships between the resources, capabilities, and practices of a SCN. The relationships were then examined to analyze their influences on firm performance. Several cases and practical examples were included in the study to give a better understanding of the conceptual research model. Various keywords were used in searching literature for the constructs of the research model. For example, ""knowledge"" and ""supply chain network"" were used to search the literature regarding the SCN intangible resources. Findings - This study uses a conceptual model to identify SCN resources that are dispersed in the internal territory among different network members, SCN capabilities that are developed based on these network resources and lead to the firm's competitive performance, and SCN practices used to acquire network resources and build network capabilities. Research limitations/implications - The conceptual model of SCN resources, capabilities, and practices needs further empirical validation. Practical implications - The conceptual model provides a framework for managers to identify the critical resources, capabilities, and practices of a SCN that help a firm achieve sustainable competitive performance.

"© 2015 Elsevier B.V. Abstract Recently, businesses and research communities have paid a lot of attention to social media and big data. However, the field of supply chain management (SCM) has been relatively slow in studying social media and big data for research and practice. In these contexts, this research contributes to the SCM community by proposing a novel, analytical framework (Twitter Analytics) for analyzing supply chain tweets, highlighting the current use of Twitter in supply chain contexts, and further developing insights into the potential role of Twitter for supply chain practice and research. The proposed framework combines three methodologies - descriptive analytics (DA), content analytics (CA) integrating text mining and sentiment analysis, and network analytics (NA) relying on network visualization and metrics - for extracting intelligence from 22,399 #supplychain tweets. Some of the findings are: supply chain tweets are used by different groups of supply chain professionals and organizations (e.g., news services, IT companies, logistic providers, manufacturers) for information sharing, hiring professionals, and communicating with stakeholders, among others; diverse topics are being discussed, ranging from logistics and corporate social responsibility, to risk, manufacturing, SCM IT and even human rights; some tweets carry strong sentiments about companies' delivery services, sales performance, and environmental standards, and risk and disruption in supply chains. Based on these findings, this research presents insights into the use and potential role of Twitter for supply chain practices (e.g., professional networking, stakeholder engagement, demand shaping, new product/service development, supply chain risk management) and the implications for research. Finally, the limitations of the current study and suggestions for future research are presented.",Insights from hashtag #supplychain and Twitter analytics: Considering Twitter and Twitter data for supply chain practice and research,Application Programming Interface (API) *** Big data *** Content analytics *** Data analytics *** Network analytics *** Social media analytics *** Supply chain management *** Twitter,international journal of production economics,84929513110,2015,,,,,,

In modern battlefield environment, the demand for military spare parts is uncertain because of high uncertainty in battlefield. In the same time, the broken parts in battlefield can be remanufactured into new ones in time, and used to satisfy the demand together with the parts delivered from backside. This supply pattern can both satisfy the demand in time and reduce the costs for delivery and store. New challenges are brought for the optimization of military spare parts supply, as the remanufacturing rate for the broken parts is usually uncertain. The supply planning problem for multiples military spare parts is studied with the consideration of uncertainties from demand and remanufacturing.

"© JASSS. To increase profitability, farmers often decide to form strategic partnerships with other farmers, pooling their resources and outputs for greater efficiency and scale. These coordination decisions can have far-reaching and complex implications for overall food supply chain structural emergence, which in turn impacts system outcomes and long-term sustainability. In this paper, we describe an agent-based model that explores the impacts of farmer coordination decisions on the development of food supply chain structure over time. This model focuses on one type of coordination mechanism implementation method, in which coordinated farmer groups produce a single crop type and combine their yields to achieve economies of scale. The farmer agents' decisions to coordinate with one another depend on their evaluation of the tradeoff between their autonomy and the expected economic benefits of coordination. Each coordination decision is a bilateral process in which the terms of group reward sharing are negotiated. We capture the effects of farmers' size, income, and autonomy premia, as well as volume-price relationships and group profit-sharing rules, on the rate of farmer coordination and the number and size of groups that form. Results indicate that under many conditions, coordination groups tend to consolidate over time, which suggests implications for overall supply chain structural resilience.",Impacts of farmer coordination decisions on food supply chain structure,Agent-Based Modeling *** Coordination *** Farmer decision making *** Food supply chains *** Multi-Agent Simulation *** Sustainable agriculture,jasss,84926294052,2015,,,,,,
"In this paper, we cope with a two-stage distribution planning problem of supply chain regarding fixed charges. The focus of the paper is on developing efficient solution methodologies of the selected NP-hard problem. Based on computational limitations, common exact and approximation solution approaches are unable to solve real-world instances of such NP-hard problems in a reasonable time. These approaches involve cumbersome computational steps in real-size cases. In order to solve the mixed integer linear programming model, we develop an artificial immune system and a sheep flock algorithm to achieve better solutions in comparison to earlier approaches. The evaluations are set up based on two phases; first, comparing performances of two proposed algorithms with two previous studies with the same data (two previously proposed genetic algorithm and ant colony optimization methods) and second, evaluating two proposed algorithms in larger instances.

"As the green movement spreads across the globe, organizations are under pressure to reduce the emissions across their supply chain. On the other hand, they need to cut supply costs to gain a competitive edge. This paper proposes Green DEA (GDEA), a comprehensive approach based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) with carbon footprint monitoring. GDEA builds on an existing DEA model with weight restrictions and dual role factors, and introduces carbon footprints as necessary dual role factors with weight restrictions. Unlike other researches, GDEA incorporates heterogeneous suppliers and also takes into account regional emission compliance standards and laws. GDEA encourages suppliers to go green and cut down their carbon footprints and comply with emission norms along with reducing costs in order to survive competition. Results from model validation in a well-known automobile spare parts manufacturer in India are presented to verify the GDEA approach. Overall, GDEA cuts across a huge and varied supplier base, caters to almost all businesses, is environment-friendly and robust. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"Managing production level after the launch of a new product is a challenging problem and is critical to the overall profit of manufacturing firms. The problem involves concepts from different fields including production planning, manufacturing flexibility, forecasting, and marketing. In this paper, the gaps in the existing literature are first illustrated. With the goal of addressing the identified research gaps, agent-based modeling and simulation is employed to analyze the performance of different production planning strategies under various levels of volume flexibility and consumer social network structures. The key distinguishing feature of the developed model is the capability of the manufacturing firm to adjust its production level by forecasting the future demand. The analysis of the simulation outputs yields substantial results by challenging some intuitive and traditional understandings of manufacturing systems. The paper also provides a discussion on managerial implications of the results in order to provide the managers with guidelines on the implementation of the model in real-world diffusion environments.",Managing production level in new product diffusion: an agent-based simulation approach,production planning *** new product diffusion *** agent-based modeling and simulation *** manufacturing flexibility *** demand forecasting,international journal of production research,WOS:000340363400002,2014,,,,,,
"Foreign investment decisions by multinational enterprises are usually arrived by considering not just the firm-specific factors, but location-specific factors are also of paramount importance. Using three supply factors specific to a country - supply environment, supply infrastructure, absorptive capacity, we construct a rating system representing the potential of a nation to attract foreign direct investment (FDI). We use the combinatorics- and Boolean-based logical analysis of data (LAD) method to capture the individual and combined impact of the supply factors on the FDI inflow. The LAD classification system is shown to be robust, cross-validating very well, thereby allowing its use for prediction purposes, and permitting the derivation of a rating system that can have various granularity levels. By linking FDI potential with supply capability related factors, the findings of this research contribute to future FDI decisions by firms as well as provide assistance and direction to strategic planners of countries that seek to enhance their attractiveness as FDI destinations. As technology matures, production processes start to lack differentiation and firms look to establish facilities globally to become more competitive.

"Ever since its commitment to the Copenhagen Accord of 2009 to lower its carbon emissions by 2020 to a level that will be 40% below those of 2005, China has been aiming to develop its photovoltaic (PV) solar energy industry. Because knowledge is a critical factor for obtaining a sustainable competitive advantage in a knowledge-intensive industry, it is essential to build up an interactive learning and communicating platform as a facilitator to absorb, distribute and create knowledge within a firm and among its suppliers and customers. However, relevant literature has, hitherto, never discussed such an intermediary platform for innovation. Therefore, this paper proposes some conceptual assumptions to solve this problem. After a practical investigation, this paper seeks to find suitable intermediaries for innovation at different levels of the PV solar energy supply chain in China. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"Today's manufacturing environments are very dynamic and turbulent. Traditional enterprise information systems (EISs) have mostly been implemented upon hierarchical architectures, which are inflexible to adapt changes and uncertainties promptly. Next-generation EISs must be agile and adaptable to accommodate changes without significant time delays. It is essential for an EIS to obtain real-time data from the distributed and dynamic manufacturing environment for decision making. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems provide an excellent infrastructure for data acquisition, distribution, and processing. In this paper, some key challenges related to the integration of WSN and RFID technologies are discussed. A five-layer system architecture has been proposed to achieve synergistic performance. For the integration of WSN and RFID, one of the critical issues is the low efficiency of communication due to redundant data as redundant data increases energy consumption and causes time delay. To address it, an improved data cleaning algorithm has been proposed; its feasibility and effectiveness have been verified via simulation and a comparison with a published algorithm. To illustrate the capacity of the developed architecture and new data cleaning algorithm, their application in relief supplies storage management has been discussed.",Data Cleaning for RFID and WSN Integration,Data cleaning *** enterprise information system (EIS) *** industrial informatics *** networks *** radio-frequency identification (RFID) *** system architecture *** system integration *** wireless sensor network (WSN),ieee transactions on industrial informatics,WOS:000336668600040,2014,,,,,,
"Green Logistics has emerged as the new agenda item in supply chain management. The traditional objective of distribution management has been upgraded to minimizing system-wide costs related to economic and environmental issues. Reflecting the environmental sensitivity of vehicle routing problems (VRP), an extensive literature review of Green Vehicle Routing Problems (GVRP) is presented. We provide a classification of GVRP that categorizes GVRP into Green-VRP, Pollution Routing Problem, VRP in Reverse Logistics, and suggest research gaps between its state and richer models describing the complexity in real-world cases. The purpose is to review the most up-to-date state-of-the-art of GVRP, discuss how the traditional VRP variants can interact with GVRP and offer an insight into the next wave of research into GVRP. It is hoped that OR/MS researchers together with logistics practitioners can be inspired and cooperate to contribute to a sustainable industry. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"South East Queensland's (SEQ's) centralised electricity system is under great pressure to adapt. Climate change is converging with socio-economic, demographic and technological changes to create a 'perfect storm' for the region's electricity system. Distribution networks are particularly affected, with these factors contributing to tremendous peak demand growth, about double the rate of growth in average demand in recent years. This paper reviews how Australia's electricity system is adapting to multiple drivers of peak electricity demand. We use socio-technical transitions theory to understand the temporal interconnected social and technical dimensions of adaptation in this setting. Specifically, we present an historical narrative of the emergence of centralisation in Australia and outline the peak demand problem in SEQ and review adaptation options from the international literature. We also analyse the interactions between key social groups and their adaptation responses over the past decade. Our analysis shows that adaptation has become a contested process between supply-chain actors and end-users, each with different economic objectives, adaptation needs and capacities. The resulting adaptation dynamic that is emerging shows worrying signs of maladaptation. Implications for market governance and urban policy and research are discussed.","The challenge of adapting centralised electricity systems: peak demand and maladaptation in South East Queensland, Australia",Adaptation *** Socio-technical transitions *** Peak electricity demand *** Electricity networks,regional environmental change,WOS:000333267700004,2014,,,,,,
"The US military operates some of the largest and most complex supply chains in the world and their experience provides insight into a variety of supply chain issues. This paper taps that experience to study how the design of a supply chain is influenced by its economic environment. Consider these circumstances: the military is not a profit-seeking enterprise, they want to achieve a particular state of readiness and cost is secondary to that goal. Modern weapons systems are complex, expensive, push the envelope of technology, and the volume requisitioned is often small such that few manufacturers can afford to be in the business; and these expensive weapons systems operate in harsh operating conditions where wear and tear is substantial, consequently remanufacturing of systems and parts is a critical source of supply. Focusing on the supply chain of the US Army, this paper uses an economic model to study their responses to these conditions, how supply chain design is affected by these conflicting goals, and how those designs affect cost and efficiency.",Military supply chains and closed-loop systems: resource allocation and incentives in supply sourcing and supply chain design,weapons systems *** supply chain design *** closed-loop supply chains *** remanufacture *** military supply chains,international journal of production research,WOS:000332202700004,2014,,,,,,
"The recycling of urban solid wastes is a critical point for the closing supply chains of many products, mainly when their value cannot be completely recovered after use. In addition to environmental aspects, the process of recycling involves technical, economic, social and political challenges for public management. For most of the urban solid waste, the management of the end-of-life depends on selective collection to start the recycling process. For this reason, an efficient selective collection has become a mainstream tool in the Brazilian National Solid Waste Policy. In this paper, we study effective models that might support the location planning of sorting centers in a medium-sized Brazilian city that has been discussing waste management policies over the past few years. The main goal of this work is to provide an optimal location planning design for recycling urban solid wastes that fall within the financial budget agreed between the municipal government and the National Bank for Economic and Social Development. Moreover, facility planning involves deciding on the best sites for locating sorting centers along the four-year period as well as finding ways to meet the demand for collecting recyclable materials, given that economic factors, consumer behavior and environmental awareness are inherently uncertain future outcomes. To deal with these issues, we propose a deterministic version of the classical capacity facility location problem, and both a two-stage recourse formulation and risk-averse models to reduce the variability of the second-stage costs. Numerical results suggest that it is possible to improve the current selective collection, as well as hedge against data uncertainty by using stochastic and risk-averse optimization models.

"We propose an efficient evolutionary multi-objective optimization approach to the capacitated facility location-allocation problem (CFLP) for solving large instances that considers flexibility at the allocation level, where financial costs and CO2 emissions are considered simultaneously. Our approach utilizes suitably adapted Lagrangian Relaxation models for dealing with costs and CO2 emissions at the allocation level, within a multi-objective evolutionary framework at the location level. Thus our method assesses the robustness of each location solution with respect to our two objectives for customer allocation. We extend our exploration of selected solutions by considering a range of trade-offs for customer allocation. (C) 2014 The Authors.

"Supply chains are critical to global operations. However, they involve many risks that require consideration of trade-offs. Furthermore, consideration of the environment is becoming critical as well. This paper views supply chain decision-making from a system perspective, using multiple criteria decision-making as a framework. Systems perspectives of supply chains are discussed. Criteria and factors are reviewed for green supply chain management, supply chain risk, and supply chain efficiency. Selected papers balancing criteria in supply chain decision-making are reviewed with the purpose of demonstrating risk and environmental criteria with efficiency. The conclusions discuss how systemic features are demonstrated by these decision-making criteria. It is contended that consideration of systemic trade-offs will lead to sounder supply chain decision-making.

"The aims of this study are to investigate the presence of 30 substances known or thought to act as endocrine disrupting compounds in tap water from the main water supply areas for region of Madrid, to determine the total estrogenic activity of the samples analysed and to estimate the health risk for the population resulting from those compounds found at detectable concentrations. To this end, a one-off composite sampling was performed in August 2012 in which six tap water samples were collected from private residences in the drinking water supply network of the region of Madrid. A total of 14 of the 30 endocrine disruptors analysed were found at concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 165 ng/L. The organophosphorus flame retardants were detected at the highest concentrations followed by the plasticizer bisphenol A, alkylphenols, anticorrosion agents and preservatives. Tap water in the region of Madrid is contaminated with traces (ng/L) of compounds with endocrine disrupting properties. Although the concentrations of endocrine disrupting compounds obtained are too low to be able to confirm a public health risk, and no risk has been detected upon evaluation, it should be remembered that these compounds act at very low doses and that their effects may only appear in the long term.",Monitoring endocrine disrupting compounds and estrogenic activity in tap water from Central Spain,Endocrine disrupting compounds *** Priority pollutants *** Tapwater *** Estrogenic activity *** Risk Assessment *** Central Spain,environmental science and pollution research,WOS:000340460500034,2014,,,,,,
"The desalination industry has been growing progressively in the last few decades. A large number of new plants are contracted every year. Strategic decisions related to plant locations and capacity, the selection of the desalination technology, and many other technical decisions related to the plant design and operation are very critical to these strategic investments. Viewing the desalination industry network as a supply chain provides a holistic view allowing decision makers to perform optimization of water desalination operations end to end. The methodology we propose provides the decision makers with (1) a set of investment alternatives comprising combinations of the different desalination locations, capacities, technologies, and energy sources, and (2) a decision graph showing the performance of each decision alternative in terms of quantitative and qualitative performance metrics chosen by the decision maker. The case study of Saudi Arabia, the world leader in desalination, shows how the methodology can present strategic planners with an optimal configuration of the desalination supply chain.

"To attain an ongoing electricity economy, developing novel widespread electricity supply systems based on diverse energy resources are critically important. Several photovoltaic (PV) technologies exist, which cause various pathways to produce electricity from solar energy. This paper evaluates the competition between three influential solar technologies based on photovoltaic technique to find the optimal pathways for satisfying the electricity demand: (1) multicrystalline silicon; (2) copper, indium, gallium, and selenium (CIGS); and (3) multijunction. Besides the technical factors, there are other effective parameters such as cost, operability, feasibility, and capacity that should be considered when assessing the different pathways as optimal and viable long-term alternatives. To aid this decision-making process, a generic optimization-based model was developed for the long-range energy planning and design of future electricity supply system from solar energy. By applying dynamic programming techniques, the model is capable of identifying the optimal investment strategies and integrated supply system configurations from the many alternatives. The features and capabilities of the model were shown through application to Iran as a case study.",Modeling and Technical-Economic Optimization of Electricity Supply Network by Three Photovoltaic Systems,optimization model *** multicrystalline silicon PV *** CIGS PV *** multijunction PV *** electricity supply system,journal of solar energy engineering-transactions of the asme,WOS:000344518400027,2014,,,,,,
"© 2014 IEEE. The modern data centers (DCs) are essential to fulfilling ever-evolving computational demands around cloud computing, big data, and IT infrastructure. These DCs are facilities (Figure 1) that house computer systems and associated components such as networking and storage systems. To operate a DC, power supplies, network connections, environmental controls (e.g., air conditioning, humidity), and security infrastructure are needed. Technology and business challenges such as virtualization, load consolidation, real-time troubleshooting, and service-level guarantees require a robust and adaptive server management plan for enterprise. The majority of DC issues are related to overutilization of resources, application failures, data security, power usage effectiveness (PUE), and infrastructure costs. This requires proactive solutions that are business intelligent and built over a network of sense points that are guaranteed to deliver reliable trends and measurements in a reliable and timely fashion. Since it is expensive to build new DCs, the best option is to improve usage of an existing facility through lower infrastructure overhead to deliver better resource management. An optimal sensor network would perform real-time sensor-data collection and deliver a) improved server rack utilization, b) improved DC cooling, and c) improved loadbalancing through dynamic capping of thermally constrained systems.",Wireless data center management: Sensor network applications and challenges,Data centers *** Database management *** Wireless communication *** Wireless sensor networks,ieee microwave magazine,84912102485,2014,,,,,,
"Supply chain network (SCN) modeling has gain a great research interest as companies realized that scientific approaches in managing their SCN's, rather than ""common-sense"" heuristics, are the roads to achieve sustainability, profitability, growth, and competiveness. Ever since, the relevant literature is supplied with models that aim to optimize SCN's design and/or operation. The former is a strategic process that designs network's infrastructure and concerns long term investments which undertake huge amounts of capitals. SCN managers should be able to evaluate how these decisions contribute to the overall performance of the company and not assess them with only cost oriented indicators. By employing advance financial management methods, such as sale and leaseback (SLB), fixed assets could be the medium to improve liquidity and strengthen credit solvency. This paper aims to enrich the SCN design literature by introducing a Mixed-Integer Non Linear Programming (MINLP) model that integrates SLB technique with SCN design decisions. By exploiting the properties of the MINLP model it is reformulated into an exact Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that is solved to global optimality. A real case study from a consumer goods company is utilized in order to show model's functionality and to evaluate its adaptability, robustness, and benefit. The model could assist and support SCN managers in effective decision making in the strategic level. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Integration of sale and leaseback in the optimal design of supply chain networks,Exact linearization *** Finance integration *** MINLP *** Optimization *** Sale and leaseback *** Supply chain network design,omega (united kingdom),84899943306,2014,,,,,,
"This paper presents a systematic review of research on management in the pharmaceutical supply chain (PSC). Recent PSC literature, published in peer-reviewed academic journals, was collated for content analysis. Research efforts depict a traditional focus on efficiency-improvement, with an emerging interest in process-analysis and technology implementation in the PSC. PSC research is also highly context-specific and focuses on developed economies. Accompanied with a transition towards network-centric approaches, studies depict distinct focus on three levels of industrial interaction, which influence the final value delivered. Research focus is rapidly moving from value addition within the pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution environment to the interface with healthcare services, facilitated by the healthcare procurement and supply function.

"McKesson is America's oldest and largest healthcare services company. IBM Research developed an innovative scenario modeling and analysis tool, supply chain scenario modeler (SCSM), for McKesson to optimize its endto-end pharmaceutical supply chain policies. Through integrated operations research (OR) models, SCSM optimizes the distribution network, supply flow, inventory, and transportation policies, and quantifies the impacts of changes on financial, operational, and environmental metrics. The modeling work spawned a roadmap of projects with quantified opportunities, including a new air freight supply chain path, and provided new insights that have been critical to improving McKesson's performance as a pharmaceutical industry leader. A structured data model supporting the OR models has provided a basis for additional improvement projects. The model directly links OR modeling results to a detailed profit-and-loss statement by product category for the different supply chain paths that McKesson uses.

"Increasing environmental, legislative, and social concerns are forcing companies to take a fresh view of the impact of supply chain operations on environment and society when designing a sustainable supply chain. A challenging task in today's food industry is distributing high quality perishable foods throughout the food supply chain. This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization model by integrating sustainability in decision-making, on distribution in a perishable food supply chain network (SCN). It introduces a two-echelon location-routing problem with time-windows (2E-LRPTW) for sustainable SCN design and optimizing economical and environmental objectives in a perishable food SCN. The goal of 2E-LRPTW is to determine the number and location facilities and to optimize the amount of products delivered to lower stages and routes at each level. It also aims to reduce costs caused by carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions throughout the network. The proposed method includes a novel multi-objective hybrid approach called MHPV, a hybrid of two known multi-objective algorithms: namely, multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and adapted multi-objective variable neighborhood search (AMOVNS). MHPV features two strategies for leader selection procedures (LSP), (i.e. Grids) and crowding distance is compared to common genetic algorithms based on metaheuristics (i.e. MOGA, NRGA and NSGA-II). Results indicate that the hybrid approach achieves better solutions compared to others, and that crowding distance method for LSP outperforms the former Grids method. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Two-echelon multiple-vehicle location-routing problem with time windows for optimization of sustainable supply chain network of perishable food,Food supply chain *** Greenhouse gases emissions *** Perishable foods *** Robust multi-objective metaheuristic *** Sustainability *** Sustainable supply chain design *** Two-echelon location-routing problem,international journal of production economics,84899922920,2014,,,,,,
"Research on supply chain network design has mainly pursued efficiency oriented objectives for boosting service level and profit. However, the priority of an enterprise facing bankruptcy pressure shifts to fulfill debt obligation with limited financial resources and survive downsizing. In this paper, we define a supply chain downsizing problem (SCDP) under bankruptcy as streamlining a supply chain network in order to balance a business survival and its long term profitability. We formulate a mixed integer programming (MIP) model with specific downsizing features, which maximizes the utilization of investment resources through a combined operation of demand selection and production assets reallocation. The corresponding robust counterparts of the MIP model are further developed based on robust optimization techniques for dealing with uncertainties of demands and exchange rates. We analyze and validate the proposed downsizing MIP model with a series of systematically generated test cases while its robust counterparts are studied extensively using a large generated case. The findings demonstrate the value of our approach in discovering detailed downsizing plans in magnitude and direction and provide valuable insight into how financial debt payback could be arranged, and in a unique way show managers how the reconfigured downsized network would mitigate and lead to a sustainable and higher economic value supply chain. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Supply chain downsizing under bankruptcy: A robust optimization approach,Bankruptcy *** Downsizing *** Robust optimization *** Supply chain *** Uncertain demand *** Uncertain exchange rate,international journal of production economics,84901708304,2014,,,,,,
"This paper proposes a fuzzy goal programming-based (FGP-based) approach for solving a multi-objective mathematical model of reverse supply chain design. In a green supply chain, designing the network of the reverse chain is vital. Thus, the robust configuration of reverse chain will cause acting friendly with the environment and brings a huge benefit for the partners of the supply chain. Hence, it can be used as competitive competency. Three objectives are considered to minimise recycling cost, rate of waste generated by recyclers and material recovery time in such a way that the best set of recyclers to allocate products is determined. The major advantage of the proposed model is that it considers cost, time and efficiency rate to design responsive and efficient reverse supply chain.

In the context of fuzzy mathematical programming, the paper jointly considers fuzzy/flexible constraints for fuzziness, fuzzy coefficients for lack of knowledge, and fuzzy goal of decision maker(s).

"Globalisation, along with rapid demographic changes and evolving regulatory and legislative interventions, dictates the increasing demand for high quality, value-added and customised agrifood products. In this context, the design, development and operation of efficient agrifood supply chains (AFSCs) have begun to be met with increased interest in modern management science. Furthermore, the volatility of weather conditions, the perishability of goods, the complex food safety regulatory environment, the changing consumers' lifestyle trends, the environmental concerns and the plethora of stakeholders involved pose significant challenges towards the development of robust supply chains within the agrifood sector.In this manuscript, we provide a comprehensive hierarchical decision-making framework and a critical taxonomy that apply to all stakeholders involved in the design and management of AFSCs. More specifically, we first present the generic system components along with the unique characteristics of AFSCs that differentiate them from conventional supply chain networks. We then recognise the natural hierarchy of the decision-making process for the design and planning of AFSCs and provide a taxonomy of existing research efforts as these are mapped on the relevant strategic, tactical and operational levels of the hierarchical decision-making echelons. Our critical analysis demonstrates that the agrifood supply chain management is a rapidly evolving research field, focussing more on addressing case-dependent problems related with distinct supply chain echelons, and less on developing integrated methodological approaches for the optimisation of the entire supply chain. Our analysis further allows for the identification of gaps and overlaps in literature, as well as of future research areas. © 2013 IAgrE.",Agrifood supply chain management: A comprehensive hierarchical decision-making framework and a critical taxonomy, ,biosystems engineering,84896546056,2014,,,,,,
"The paper aims to illustrate the use of fuzzy data envelopment analysis (DEA) in analyzing reverse supply chain (RSC) performance from the manufacturer's perspective. By using an alternative α-cut approach, the fuzzy DEA model was converted into a crisp linear programming problem, thereby altering the problem to an interval programming one. The model is able to obtain precise and robust efficiency values. An investigation was also made between the obtained efficiency scores and certain relevant background information of the companies. The study revealed that while ISO 14001 certification usually ensures an environmentally friendly supply chain network, companies which have implemented RSC techniques since a longer duration do not necessarily have a more efficient supply chain in general. © 2014 Manasvi Kumar et al.",Evaluating reverse supply chain efficiency: Manufacturer's perspective, ,mathematical problems in engineering,84904656852,2014,,,,,,
"This work is focused on the use of biomass waste to feed already existing coal combustion plants as a part of paving the way toward the reduction of the environmental impact. The biomass waste supply chain optimization is critical to conceive long-term viable projects and deal with the biomass heterogeneous nature and drawbacks to be used with coal, i.e. principally high moisture content and low bulk density. This paper studies biomass transportation, storage and change of properties (moisture content and hence dry matter, energy density and bulk density) through the use of different pre-treatments: (i) torrefaction, (ii) torrefaction combined with pelletization, (iii) pelletization, (iv) fast pyrolysis and (v) fast pyrolysis combined with char grinding, which produce a range of very different pre-treated biomass. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) that evaluates the net present value and the environmental impact through a life cycle assessment (LCA). The results propose location-allocation decision together with the selection/capacity of pre-treatment technologies for each scenario. The scenarios contemplate different biomass characteristics, availability and distribution for a supply chain case study located in Spain: forest and agricultural woody residues used to replace at least 10% of the total thermal inlet power provided by coal in the existing network of thermal plants. © 2014 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.",Optimization of pre-treatment selection for the use of woody waste in co-combustion plants,Biomass seasonality *** Biomass supply chain *** Biomass waste *** Co-combustion *** Multi-objective MILP *** Superstructure of pre-treatments,chemical engineering research and design,84905089542,2014,,,,,,
"© 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Sustainable supply chain network design is a rich area for academic research that is still in its infancy and has potential to affect supply chain performance. Increasing regulations for carbon and waste management are forcing firms to consider their supply chains from ecological and social objectives, but in reality, however, facilities and the links connecting them are disrupted from time to time, due to poor weather, natural or manmade disasters or a combination of any other factors. Supply chain systems drop their sustainability objectives while coping with these unexpected disruptions. Hence, the new challenges for supply chain managers are to design an efficient and effective supply chain network that will be resilient enough to bounce back from any disruption and that also should have sufficient vigilance to offer same sustainability under a disruption state. This paper focuses on ecological sustainability, because an environmental focus in a supply chain system is more important and also links with other pillars of sustainability, as the products need to be produced, packed and transported in an ethical way, which should not harm social balance and the environment. Owing to importance of the considered issue, this paper attempts to introduce a network optimization model for a sustainable and resilient supply chain network by incorporating (1) sustainability via carbon emissions and embodied carbon footprints and (2) resilience by incorporating location-specific risks. The proposed goal programming (GP) model optimizes the total cost, while considering the resilience and sustainability of the supply chain network.",Sustainable and resilient supply chain network design under disruption risks,Disruption risks *** Green supply chain *** Resilient supply chain *** Sustainable supply chain,sustainability (switzerland),84908010682,2014,,,,,,
"The emergence of the RFID technology and its application to supply chain processes has in particular led to the creation of such standards as the EPCglobal's model of supply networks as a tool for materializing intra- and inter-enterprise visibility of resources and products, collaboration and integration. Among other critical uses, RFID has been deployed by supply networks to improve asset utilization, effectively combat counterfeiting, and advance targeted product recalls. However, new affordable and deployable technologies and microsensors have recently appeared and keep maturing. This paper discusses the needs and the possibilities that exist for leveraging these technologies and sensors with RFID to guarantee continuous and seamless visibility of all assets (fixed and mobile resources and field personnel) of smart enterprises, thereby expanding and complementing the roles of RFID. It examines the design challenges for the integration of these technologies for advanced logistics operations at the level of product classes or their instances. It then outlines our development of an embedded microsystem that combines RFID, GPRS, GPS and environmental sensors for applications in logistics.

"The frequency and intensity of disasters continue to increase. Following large-scale and catastrophic disasters, local organisations integrate with other responding organisations to form hastily disaster relief supply chain networks. Such supply networks are infrequently activated in a single location, generate unparalleled uncertainty, change quickly, and are driven by the urgency of saving lives and restoring livelihoods. Unfortunately, even where sound supply chain management practices are used, supply networks have encountered diverse levels of resilience and adequate disaster relief performance has remained elusive. In this paper, several unique characteristics that disaster relief efforts exhibit are examined as compared with demand-driven, steady-state supply chains. Important differences in the flows of resource, money, and information are identified. A complex adaptive supply network (CASN) lens is used to frame what existing literature has uncovered regarding disaster relief efforts, showing how relief organisations, their interactions, and their environmental context help determine the level of resilience that supply networks experience following disasters. This CASN characterisation is leveraged to help explain why traditional supply chain management practices lead to varied results in disaster relief.

For a static early warning network, this paper analysed the cost account of a cycle quality chain under the network structure of positive and negative closed-loop control, as well as the structure of retail channel and e-channel control. In addition, an early warning security mechanism was proposed to handle the dynamic early warning network of a dual-channel cycle quality chain under the disturbance of e-channel lead time. Meanwhile, customised early warning security rules were defined to deal with different patterns of market environment with lead time disturbance. To verify the modelling framework and algorithm, we provided solutions to some examples of numerical cycle quality early warning network, which demonstrated that the disturbances have been relieved and controlled effectively.",Cycle quality chain early warning network with e-channel lead time disruption,early warning system *** emergence mechanism *** quality chain *** risk management *** supply chain management,international journal of systems science: operations and logistics,85013851393,2014,,,,,,
"Incorporating sustainability into supply chain management has become a critical issue driven by pressures from governments, customers, and various stakeholder groups over the past decade. This study proposes a strategic decision-making model considering both the operational costs and social costs caused by the carbon dioxide emissions from operating such a supply chain network for sustainable supply chain management. This model was used to evaluate carbon dioxide emissions and operational costs under different scenarios in an apparel manufacturing supply chain network. The results showed that the higher the social cost rate of carbon dioxide emissions, the lower the amount of the emission of carbon dioxide. The results also suggested that a legislation that forces the enterprises to bear the social costs of carbon dioxide emissions resulting from their economic activities is an effective approach to reducing carbon dioxide emissions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",A strategic decision-making model considering the social costs of carbon dioxide emissions for sustainable supply chain management,Carbon dioxide emissions *** Social costs *** Sustainable supply chain management,journal of environmental management,84891817558,2014,,,,,,
"Geographers broadly, and political ecologists in particular, have been at the forefront of analyzing the progressive linking of Northern consumption practices with livelihoods elsewhere, problematizing the devolution that places 'citizen-consumers', NGOs, and corporate actors as key political agents of protecting workers and environments, promoting 'ethical' trade, and 'greening' economies through their purchasing choices. Utilizing empirical work on the development of certification and labeling schemes designed to ensure the safe recycling of used electronics, or e-wastes, across a global supply chain, this paper extends lessons learned from these critical analyses of consumer politics to ongoing debates about e-waste, trade, and recycling. I highlight the ambiguities and democratic deficits that emerge from promoting global environmental justice politics through market-driven disposal choices. I analyze the practices of representation through which NGOs and institutions produce e-waste as an object of regulation/commodification that is amenable to consumer action and argue that there is a disconnect between the abstractions necessary to sell 'ethical' e-waste recycling and the nuances of place-specific recycling practices. Like other fair trade schemes, certifications for ethical electronics recyclers rely upon narratives, such as environmental justice, that construct the e-waste problem in ways that render it governable, or 'legible' in Scott's sense. However, given the complexity of global commodity-networks like those for used electronics, these governing narratives rely on abstractions that oversimplify and rework the fetish of what e-waste is, where it goes, and how it should be managed. In unearthing both what labels do as well as the silences and ambiguities embedded within them, the limits and opportunities of consumer-driven waste politics come more clearly into view.",Political ecologies of electronic waste: Uncertainty and legitimacy in the governance of e-waste geographies,Certification *** E-waste *** Environmental justice *** Labeling *** Political ecology,environment and planning a,84892999409,2014,,,,,,
"Technological innovation is necessary but not sufficient to achieve food security. This article uses interlinked social, ecological and technical systems theory to investigate why agricultural biodiversity-rich developing countries fail to utilize ""agroecological competence,"" particularly natural resource-based competitive advantage, to achieve food security despite substantial investments in ""technological competence"" development. Empirical study involves a critical examination of two food security strategies: improving subsistence agriculture to contribute to Nepal's national food security strategies, and promoting high value agriculture integrating Indian farmers into global commodity supply chains. Findings from these countries at very different stages of economic agricultural development suggest that low and middle-income countries, irrespective of their economic growth, cannot succeed unless technological competences are complemented by critical systems of ""learning competence."" © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Critical systems of learning and innovation competence for addressing complexity in transformations to agricultural sustainability,Agricultural biodiversity *** Complexity *** Critical systems of learning competence *** India *** Nepal *** Socio-ecotechnical systems,agroecology and sustainable food systems,84893433604,2014,,,,,,
"We present an ad hoc geospatial origin-destination model that utilizes the rudiments of operations research optimization techniques to estimate feasible multimodal routes that may or may not be geospatially connected. The model is designed to determine and optimize large-scale container flows from US trade partners to inland markets mainly located within the lower 48 states. The dynamic traffic assignment for the freight flow considers several factors such as congestion, volume/capacity (V/C) ratio, throughput and distance-based impedance and the Geographic Information Systems platform provides a visualization environment for all feasible routes. Visual analytics with the resultant geographical distribution maps indicate that maritime containers are concentrated on the West Coast whereas rail shipments are densely concentrated along rail transshipment points such as Chicago, Memphis and Dallas. The highway transportation densities are mainly visible with origins from marine ports to associated market destinations starting from hinterland and radiating further away from these primal areas to other inland intermodal terminals that serve major landlocked metropolitan cities that are not served by railway networks. Our critical finding indicates that some routes, which are not generally considered as prime routes, may actually offer the best alternatives especially when considering global supply chains. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.",A coupled linear programming model with geospatial dynamic trip assignment for global-scale intermodal transportation, ,maritime economics and logistics,84894211960,2014,,,,,,
"The food industry and its supply chains have significant sustainability implications. Effective supply chain management requires careful consideration of multiple tiers of partners, especially with respect to sustainability issues. Firms increasingly approach their sub-suppliers to drive compliance with social and environmental efforts. A number of complexities and unique challenges make sub-supplier management more difficult than direct supplier management, e.g. a lack of contractual relationships to sub-suppliers, few opportunities to put direct pressure on sub-suppliers, or lack of transparency concerning sub-suppliers' involvement in a focal firm's supply chains. The literature has not investigated, either from sustainability or other perspectives, the critical success factors (CSFs) for firms' sub-supplier management. Therefore, this study seeks to explore and increase understanding of critical factors that help to overcome the complexities and unique challenges of sub-supplier management, with a focus on the food industry. Using data and information from a year-long field study in two food supply chains, the research identified 14 CSFs that influence the success of sub-suppliers' compliance with corporate sustainability standards (CSS). The identified CSFs can be classified into (1) focal firm-related, (2) relationship-related, (3) supply chain partner-related, and (4) context-related CSFs. The present research expands on the theory of critical success factors by applying the theory to the sustainability and sub-supplier management context. In support of critical success theory, it was found that CSFs do exist and their management will be necessary for effective sub-supplier management success as highlighted and exemplified by field study insights from practitioners. Multiple research avenues are necessary for further evaluation of sub-supplier management in the food industry and other industries who may find similar issues that arose from the food industry.",Critical factors for sub-supplier management: A sustainable food supply chains perspective,Corporate sustainability standards *** Field study *** Food industry *** Sub-supplier management *** Sustainable supply chain management *** Theory of critical success factors,international journal of production economics,84899896366,2014,,,,,,
"Sustainable supply chain management is a topical area which is continuing to grow and evolve. Within supply chains, downstream distribution from producers to customers plays a significant role in the environmental performance of production supply chains. With consumer consciousness growing in the area of sustainable food supply, food distribution needs to embrace and adapt to improve its environmental performance, while still remaining economically competitive. With a particular focus on the dairy industry, a robust solution approach is presented for the design of a capacitated distribution network for a two-layer supply chain involved in the distribution of milk in Ireland. In particular the green multi-objective optimisation model minimises CO2 emissions from transportation and total costs in the distribution chain. These distribution channels are analysed to ensure the non-dominated solutions are distributed along the Pareto fronts. A multi-attribute decision-making approach, TOPSIS, has been used to rank the realistic feasible transportation routes resulting from the trade-offs between total costs and CO2 emissions. The refined realistic solution space allows the decision-makers to geographically locate the sustainable transportation routes. In addition to geographical mapping the decision maker is also presented with a number of alternative analysed scenarios which forcibly open closed distribution routes to build resiliency into the solution approach. In terms of model performance, three separate GA based optimisers have been evaluated and reported upon. In the case presented NSGA-II was found to outperform its counterparts of MOGA-II and HYBRID. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",A case analysis of a sustainable food supply chain distribution system - A multi-objective approach,Dairy market case analysis *** Food supply chain distribution *** Multi-objective approach *** Scenario analysis *** Sustainable distribution routes,international journal of production economics,84899971366,2014,,,,,,
"Post-seismic inventory and logistics planning under incomplete and fuzzy information is an important yet understudied area in supply chain risk management. The goal of this paper is to propose a system dynamics model to analyze the behaviors of disrupted disaster relief supply chain by simulating the uncertainties associated with predicting post-seismic road network and delayed information. The simulation results indicate: (1) information delay has different influences over the relief head-quarter (the upstream) and the disaster-affected areas (the downstream); and (2) the change of road conditions and shipment schedules have impact on the on-time transportation rate in supply chain management. Furthermore, this paper defined and tested supplies' replenishment solutions combined with three inventory planning strategies and four forecasting methods under different lead time uncertainties. The results show that: (1) a strategy that considers information from both the post-seismic management center and the affected areas can provide a better logistic plan than an one takes information from one side; (2) the smooth-the-trend forecasting method is suitable for inventory and logistic planning when the post-seismic situations are volatile, while the quick-response forecasting method has good performance in stable environments. In addition, this paper proposes decision tree to help decision makers choose the appropriate stocking strategies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Post-seismic supply chain risk management: A system dynamics disruption analysis approach for inventory and logistics planning,Forecasting method *** Inventory and logistics planning *** Post-seismic supply chain *** Risk management *** System dynamics,computers and operations research,84886719681,2014,,,,,,
"Effective production planning of manufacturing networks requires careful consideration of several factors, including capacity, production, yields, and resource failure costs. This is particularly critical in highly variable environments where multiple resource types are available during the planning and implementation processes. This paper presents a model to aid the decision makers to determine what production resources to select, and the amount of production to allocate to each resource in order to minimise the total costs. The model considers costs associated with the production resources and customer related costs such as late delivery and loss due to undelivered units. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to examine the robustness of the optimal solution with respect to late delivery costs and loss costs. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the model by providing insights into the interactions among the cost and resource variables. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Production planning of parallel resources considering yields, failures and production costs",Manufacturing networks *** Risk modelling *** Supply chain management *** Yield modelling,international journal of applied management science,84899818238,2014,,,,,,
"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate why developing country suppliers are adopting socially sustainable practices and how the implementation process is both impeded and enabled. Design/methodology/approach: A multi-case study approach is adopted based on four ready made garment (RMG) industry suppliers in Bangladesh and the Bangladeshi buying houses of two large UK retailers. The primary mode of data collection is exploratory face-to-face interviews with 14 senior representatives. Findings are later interpreted using the transaction cost economics (TCE) theory lens. Findings: One factor motivating implementation is labour retention - a skilled labour shortage means employees will migrate to other factories if suppliers do not improve certain social standards. Barriers to implementation include a misalignment between the requirements of western codes of conduct and the cultural and socio-economic context in Bangladesh. Enablers include a shift from auditing and monitoring to more open dialogue and trust between buyers and suppliers. The paper also reveals evidence of mock compliance, e.g. suppliers keeping two sets of timesheets, and of the complexities of social sustainability. For example, while some initiatives are unanimously positive, removing child labour from RMG industry suppliers has simply diverted it to other, less regulated and more hazardous industries such as construction. Research limitations/implications: An early, exploratory contribution is provided. The work could be extended, e.g. to other stakeholders such as third-party auditors and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). Practical implications: Being aware of the motivations, barriers and enablers will help multi-national corporations (MNCs) promote good practice and anticipate the challenges they are likely to face in improving the social sustainability of their supply chains. Use of TCE leads to suggesting MNCs need to move beyond immediate suppliers and incorporate tier-two suppliers in implementation efforts. Social implications: Social sustainability improvements should benefit vulnerable workers, help suppliers develop longer term relationships with MNCs, and contribute to economic growth.

"As Indonesia heads to the polls in 2014, its economy is slowing. The end of the commodities boom and the global return to more normal monetary policy has exposed some weaknesses. Exchange-rate depreciation has absorbed some of the adjustment; but structural rigidities are still likely to limit the expansion of non-commodity sectors, and the increased fuel-subsidy bill for imported oil is putting pressure on the current account and the budget. The immediate focus is on demand-side consolidation to manage inflation and the currentaccount deficit.For an economy like Indonesia's to be overheating, and for monetary and fiscal authorities to be engineering a soft landing, when growth is below 6%, points to major structural problems. If Indonesia is to prevent the current rate of growth from becoming the new normal, there will need to be a substantial supply-side response to lift productivity, as well as a restructuring of the economy and the introduction of policies that make the economy more flexible in adjusting to shocks. The current economic slowdown has yet to trigger sweeping reforms; policy coordination remains problematic as Indonesia enters a big political year.Compared with its neighbours, Indonesia is largely on the outside of the regional production networks, and its manufacturing sector does not play into factory Asia. Now, faced with lower commodity prices globally-and growth in non-resource sectors is critical- the lack of a large manufacturing base appears to be a weakness. Indonesia is attracting more foreign direct investment than ever and is climbing the global rankings of preferred economies in which to invest, but this is occurring without improvements to its investment environment or competitiveness. Indonesia can participate more fully in global supply chains and increase its potential for growth by upgrading its infrastructure, improving its investment environment, and using regional initiatives strategically to make strong commitments that reinforce its priorities for domestic reform.In its hosting of APEC in 2013, Indonesia championed infrastructure investment where the lack of structural reform and macroeconomic constraints are inhibiting much-needed expansion, both in Indonesia and in the region. The positive outcome, albeit only a small step forward for the Doha Round, at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Bali, in December, also builds momentum for better regional and global cooperation. The priority now is for Indonesia to commit to, and show leadership in, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the implementation of the ASEAN Economic Community. © 2014 Indonesia Project ANU.",Survey of Recent Developments,economic stabilisation *** macroeconomics of development *** mineral processing *** policy reform *** protectionism,bulletin of indonesian economic studies,84897853528,2014,,,,,,
"© Emerald Group Publishing Limited. Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to develop a measure that links the causes and consequences of disruptions in freight transport operations. Such a measure is needed to quantify the scale of impact and identify the root causes of disruptions. Design/methodology/approach-In order to develop this measure, an inductive approach was adopted, using four primary case studies to test the measure in an industrial environment. The case studies are from the fast moving consumer goods sector with primary and secondary distribution networks included. The “Extra Distance” measure has been evaluated against established generic criteria that define the quality of any performance measure. Findings-The research indicates good compliance with the criteria used to evaluate the “Extra Distance” measure. The measure is also found to be useful for practitioners who are able to directly relate the measure to their distribution network operations. Research limitations/implications-Further research should see the “Extra Distance” measure further tested in other freight transport operations and industrial sectors. Practical implications-The measure is directly related to a number of causes of uncertainty which helps freight transport managers to quickly identify potential solutions. The “Extra Distance” measure can be used to quantify the effects of disruptions which can occur in road freight transport networks generate unnecessary cost within distribution networks, potentially eroding profit margins which are known to be very low in the road freight transport industry.

"© 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. Global environmental changes have led to frequent occurrences of climatic extremes. The increasingly frequent and high-magnitude natural disasters in Taiwan have caused significant mortality, injury, and property damage. In response, there have been requests to improve the capacity to cope with extreme climatic conditions through increased awareness and identification of vulnerability. Disruptions to transportation systems affect the resilience for sustaining daily operations. Among the various types of transportation systems, ports provide substantial employment and industrial activity, contributing to national and regional development. In addition, ports integrate the functions of supply chains such as services in logistics, information, and business, becoming the location of industrial clusters. Therefore, this study examines the risk of port failures from the perspective of vulnerability. Specifically, seven vulnerable factors derived from the extant literature and lessons learned from the previous disaster cases are evaluated using geographic information systems. The results reveal that port capacity and efficiency have a significant effect on port vulnerability in which the efficiency of gantry cranes, labor productivity, free trade zone business volume, and ground access networks play crucial roles in port failure. Moreover, the risks associated with port operation are evaluated by overlapping a hazard map of areas prone to debris flows and tsunami inundation. The risk maps can assist decision makers in understanding the vulnerability and adopting appropriate strategies to minimize disaster risks.",Disaster risk assessment of ports based on the perspective of vulnerability,Disaster risk assessment *** Geographic information system (GIS) *** Hazard map *** Port vulnerability,natural hazards,84939883254,2014,,,,,,
"Water facilities are among basic infrastructures in any country. In case of lack of preparedness and preventive and predictive programs and suitable staff training, any potential damage to these facilities may result in crisis and have adverse health, political and social impacts. Water transfer and distribution systems are one of the main elements in water supply facilities which are subject to qualitative and quantitative risks resulting from dangers and natural threats (earthquake and floods) as well as man-made risks (e.g. unstable flow, corrosion, high pressure, executive operation, etc.).Accidents in water supply networks especially water transmission lines annually create considerable damage for organizations. Negligence to potential dangers and determining vulnerability and risk in design, utilization and maintenance stages of facilities may create irreversible costs for operation of the water utilities, side facilities and the environment.

"Railway transportation plays an important role in many disaster relief and other emergency supply chains. Based on the analysis of several recent disaster rescue operations in China, the paper proposes a mathematical model for emergency railway wagon scheduling, which considers multiple target stations requiring relief supplies, source stations for providing supplies, and central stations for allocating railway wagons. Under the emergency environment, the aim of the problem is to minimize the weighted time for delivering all the required supplies to the targets. For efficiently solving the problem, we develop a new hybrid biogeography-based optimization (BBO) algorithm, which uses a local ring topology of population to avoid premature convergence, includes the differential evolution (DE) mutation operator to perform effective exploration, and takes some problem-specific mechanisms for fine-tuning the search process and handling the constraints. Computational experiments show that our algorithm is robust and scalable, and outperforms some state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms on a set of problem instances. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Emergency railway wagon scheduling by hybrid biogeography-based optimization,Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) *** Differential evolution (DE) *** Emergency relief supply *** Railway wagon scheduling *** Ring topology,computers and operations research,84884611857,2014,,,,,,
"Single-use systems (also referred to as disposables) have become a huge part of the bioprocessing industry, which raised concern in the industry regarding quality and security of supply. Processes must be in place to assure the supply and control of outsourced activities and quality of purchased materials along the product life cycle.

"© 2014, (publisher). All rights reserved. Evaluation of the quality of natural waters used as sources for drinking water supply is very important for selection of the proper technological treatment system that would ensure the compliance of physical, chemical and microbiological parameters with the specific standards. The current study aims at investigating the quality of two natural waters used as sources for drinking water supply of Iasi City: Prut River (surface water) and Timisesti (groundwater). The experimental analysis of the water quality was performed by daily sampling and analysis of four of the main quality indicators that are critical for disinfection: temperature, pH value, turbidity and oxidability for both sources. Evaluation of monthly, seasonal and yearly averages and variations also has been accomplished. Based on the results of this study conducted for a period of almost five years (January 2009 – November 2013) it was found that the main quality indicators for the two natural water sources comply with the Romanian technical norm. The comparison of the average values of the analyzed parameters for the period 2009 – 2013 reveals a better quality of the Timisesti source that would require only a simple physical treatment followed by chlorination. Prut River water source, however, requires a physical and chemical treatment followed by disinfection through chlorination before being distributed to the water supply network of Iasi City.","Study on the quality of water supply sources for Iasi City, Romania",Drinking water supply *** Oxidability *** Prut *** Sustainable development *** Timisesti *** Turbidity,environmental engineering and management journal,84932651555,2014,,,,,,
"The concept of the agile supply chain has been considered as means of achieving a high competitive edge in rapidly changing business environments. Among the involved decisions, supply partner selection process is a complex multi-criteria problem which has recently been studied by academicians and practitioners.

"© 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. Previous research describes supplier integration as a competitive resource that manufacturers use to create economic rents. Considering the mixed results obtained from linking supplier integration with performance outcomes, a 'dynamic' component - or the ability to reconfigure the supply chain to adapt to changing environments - appears critical to creating a sustainable competitive advantage. This study identifies integration sensing, seizing and transforming as sub-capabilities that together form a dynamic capability, referred to herein as supplier integrative capability (SIC). That is, SIC enables buyers to sense changes in the supply environment by sharing information with suppliers, seize opportunities presented by establishing procedures to analyse this information and make long-term changes to existing processes. A global sample from the industrial sector reveals that the three capabilities exhibit complementarity and must exist simultaneously for the capability to be effective, which then enhances both process flexibility and cost efficiency and helps firms avoid the traditional trade-off of cost and flexibility. In addition, market and technological dynamics strengthen the effect of SIC on operational performance; supply base complexity attenuates this link.",Developing supplier integration capabilities for sustainable competitive advantage: A dynamic capabilities approach,Buyer-supplier integration *** Dynamic capability *** Dynamics *** Operational performance *** Supply base complexity,journal of operations management,84911908399,2014,,,,,,

"The productive system complexity and its related information content are the main focus of this paper, which seeks an understanding of this complexity and the possibility of mapping and representation of the system information to optimize its management. The present study gains relevance for dealing with sustainability issues, mainly in the development of eco products and lifecycle management. Therefore, the proposal is based on the search for representing the complexity involved in the systems associated with product development in order to optimize the observation and control at the phases in its life cycle. This representation, which is necessarily of high level, should present complete diagrams with scope for improvement instead of the commonly used low complexity graphical representations, characterized by representative reductionism. The focus is on the supply chain control, which should be as tight as possible, aiming at better organization, productivity, and detailed knowledge about a product.

For tourism management, assessing and planning resilience is of growing importance since change processes and their interrelations have become more complex in a globalized, accelerated world, placing tourism under pressure to respond and adapt to various factors. Adaptation and transformation processes to changing environmental, social and economic conditions require initiatives by various tourism actors with different functions in the tourism supply chain, and on different scales of governance, to be able to assess, plan and manage resilience over time.

"One approach to use solar radiation more effectively in solar cells is to stack, in series, multiple photoactive layers with complementary absorption spectra. Such devices are often termed tandem or multi-junction solar cells. The larger number of different materials and processing steps involved in their making when compared with the single junction solar cell has to be justified and compensated by a higher efficiency. A central question to ask is how much energy you need to invest in a system in order for it to produce energy and return the investment at least once and preferably a number of times. As an initial investigation into the potential viability of the tandem or multi-junction approach we have engaged in a detailed analysis based on the manufacturing energy for each step within the tandem module supply chain for full ambient processing of thin flexible polymer tandem solar cells prepared entirely by roll processing methods. We present a comprehensive overview of relevant research results on how the energy consumption affects the energy balance when using single and multi-junction solar cells. Based on the above question we calculate the minimum efficiency that the tandem or multi-junction should present to determine the minimum energy payback time; that is whether (or when) the increase in materials use and complexity of the tandem architecture is compensated by better performance. After analysing the performance and the consideration of a series of technical improvement opportunities, we project that the tandem solar cell has to be ~20% higher performing than the corresponding single junction solar cell to be warranted. We also highlight that there is a range in the reciprocal EBPT-efficiency relationship where the tandem solar cell is an advantage. Specific to polymer and organic solar cells are however that they embody very little energy and this implies that the single junction may be an advantage, especially in cases where land mass is not critical. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Life cycle analysis of organic tandem solar cells: When are they warranted?,Energy payback time *** Life-cycle assessment *** Multi-junction solar cells *** Organic photovoltaics *** Roll-to-roll *** Tandem solar cells,solar energy materials and solar cells,84889092020,2014,,,,,,
"Concern related to green and sustainability is growing from past few years in the research area of supply chain management. Collectively, these concerns involves a higher number of interacting factors, which further can multiply complexity by the decrease in visibility of the risks in supply chain operations and so add to its vulnerability. To make supply chain (SC) capable to bear simultaneously regular and risk condition, one requires proactive planning and flexibility in the decisions making. To provide supply chain designers a proactive decision model, this paper proposes to use a flexible decision approach, i.e. Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) for recognizing the combined interactions between factors influencing sustainable risk bearing SC. However, the interpretation of the interactive relationships represented by directed links for the identified factors relatively lacks in the ISM approach, and thus may distort the process of decision making. Therefore, in this study, ISM is extended to the Total Interpretive Structural Modeling (TISM) approach to overcome these issues in interpreting the directed links in the structural model for considered factors. Further, by using relationship analysis, we graphically categorize factors on the basis of their impact on performance. Finally, TISM based the proposed model evaluates the causality and illustrate factors with interpretation of relations via directed links in the form of Interpretive Matrix, and suggests that factors at the bottom level are crucial for sustainability focused chain to build its capability on risks and risk issues. The implications at managerial level and conclusions are presented in the end. © Global Institute of Flexible Systems Management 2013.",Flexible decision approach for analysing performance of sustainable supply chains under risks/uncertainty,Flexibility *** Green *** Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) *** Performance improvement *** Risk *** Supply chain *** Sustainability *** Total Interpretive Structural Modeling (TISM),global journal of flexible systems management,84905749571,2014,,,,,,

The lack of a region specific, flexible optimization model makes it difficult for stakeholders like local policy makers, growers, and investors to make informed decisions about the economic viability and social and environmental impacts of biomass utilization. This novel contribution will illustrate an approach to develop a region specific optimization model which links various aspects of the biofuel supply chain such as feedstock source location, upstream and downstream logistics, as well as thermochemical and biochemical processing. This research shows how various individual optimization models can be combined, resulting in a complete, multivariable economic optimization model for a regional biomass network, paving a pathway for future work to develop an integrated framework for sustainability. The research demonstrated in this contribution illustrates the development of a model that can form the basis of a generalizable decision support tool that can guide investors and policy makers in making critical assessments on a local level in any particular region of interest. As a proof of concept, a portion of the described model will be validated using the Jackson Purchase region of Western Kentucky, USA, which is adjoining many coal fields and has various bio-based feedstocks. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",A multidisciplinary decision support tool for evaluating multiple biorefinery conversion technologies and supply chain performance,Biofuel *** Biomass *** Decision support tool *** Integrated biorefinery *** Process simulation *** Supply chain,clean technologies and environmental policy,84905220271,2014,,,,,,
"The objective of this manuscript is to introduce a decision methodology that allows manufacturing firms to evaluate which supplier is the most suitable partner for the implementation of a collaborative CO2 reduction management approach. The decision problem is developed for the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) industry, which currently ranks among the ten largest CO2 emitting industries worldwide. In this paper, the evaluation and selection of the most suitable supplier is performed using the analytic network process (ANP), a decision-making technique that allows practitioners to solve complex decision structures. The key contributions of the present paper reside in the combination of literature and case-based derived decision criteria, aimed at enhancing judgment validity, with particular emphasis on a collaborative setting, which is highly relevant in the present context as the focal firms often lack the necessary skills for sustainability and, at the same time, are responsible for sustainability in the supply chain. The practical application of the ANP model at a major FMCG company yields robust results corroborated through a sensitivity analysis. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"© Forest Products Society 2014. Pallets are one of the basic building blocks of supply chains. Pallets are the most common unit-load platform used across the world and allow for efficient and seamless handling, storage, and transportation of goods. Every year, 500 million new pallets are manufactured and become part of the large pool (roughly 2 billion) of pallets that are in circulation in the United States. Wood remains the most common pallet material, accounting for more than 90 percent of the inventory and applications worldwide. As companies strive to become more sustainable, a thorough understanding of the environmental impacts of every aspect of their logistics operations becomes critical. Among the many factors affecting the life cycle of wood pallets are the pallet structural design, logistics management approach, and service environment conditions. This work is the result of a comprehensive 2-year study on the operations and practices that take place during a wood pallet life cycle. In this article, a prescribed approach for estimating the carbon footprint, or greenhouse gas emissions, that arise across all phases of a pallet life cycle, is presented. In addition, the impact of contributing materials, processes, and activities in each phase is quantified. The findings presented in this article provide a foundation to guide strategies on pallet design and returnable container network and policy design.",Characterizing the carbon footprint of wood pallet logistics, ,forest products journal,84914118430,2014,,,,,,
"This paper addressing a study on robust supply chain network design under uncertainty environment.We use decomposition and coordination strategy to decompose the model as two parties: the first part is facility location decision which only concludes 0-1 decision variable, tabu search algorithm is used to determine the 0-1 decision variables, and then regard the 0-1 variables as known input parameters. The second part is flow decision, all-or-nothing method is proposed to design the capacity of the facility. From the numerical example, we can see that, the model and algorithm is valid and effective, the robust optimization model not only reduces the risk of market, but avoids the error from the shortage cost.",An effective heuristic algorithm for robust supply chain network design under uncertainty,Heuristic algorithm *** Robust optimization *** Supply chain network *** Uncertainty,applied mathematics and information sciences,84893163110,2014,,,,,,
"© 2014, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to overview carefully selected existing literature to enable further analysis directly concerned with facilities management (FM) supply chain structure, components, strategic issues, challenges and risk. Following the key aspects of assembly, design and, most importantly, management of FM supply chain are explored so that a guidance design framework can be put forward. Design/methodology/approach – This paper examines the optimum technique that can be applied by clients and FM service providers where FM functions are outsourced. The paper initially defines the network structure of the FM supply chain and then suggests a conceptual model for making decisions about FM supply chain network at the strategy level. Furthermore, the paper argues for both supply chain design and for critical node micro management in a transparent supply chain environment with the FM acting as the strategic lens through which the focus of the supply chain is achieved. Findings – This paper presents a process for designing and making decisions of FM service supply chain network. The process begins with an examination of the needs of facility services. It is followed by the step of identifying available options in delivering and processing the services. The third stage involves modelling structures of FM supply chain network. Then to make a final decision, all possible models have to be evaluated for their optimisation, both quantitative (cost) and qualitative (performance). At the end, the model with best optimisation should be selected. Originality/value – This paper proposes a conceptual framework for designing facility service supply chain strategy and configuration to fit with the specific nature of facility service demand of a given organisation. The framework, featuring a set of processes including examining demand nature, identifying options available and analysing options, is first aimed at providing an assisting tool in identifying optimum supply chain network/solution of facility services and, second, intends to stimulate further discussions on this continuously evolving and challenging market.",Designing and managing the Optimum strategic FM supply chain,Facility management *** Facility services *** Optimum technique *** Supply chain design *** Supply chain management *** Working environments,journal of facilities management,85019729530,2014,,,,,,
"With the development of global economy, the problems that supply chain management are facing become more and more complex. It is very necessary for the supply chain managers to apply new theories and methods to maintain the security of supply chain network.

Based on a network topology model, we present a good evaluation method to measure the invulnerability of supply chain network according their features. At the same time, the invulnerability degree of supply chain network is investigated through our model. The results show that the proposed approach is effective and practical for analyze and further increase the invulnerability of supply chain network.

"© 2014 Elsevier Ltd. Chemical process systems engineering considers complex supply chains which are coupled networks of dynamically interacting systems. The quest to optimize the supply chain while meeting robustness and flexibility constraints in the face of ever changing environments necessitated the development of theoretical and computational tools for the analysis, synthesis and design of such complex engineered architectures. However, it was realized early on that optimality is a complex characteristic required to achieve proper balance between multiple, often competing, and objectives. As we begin to unravel life's intricate complexities, we realize that that living systems share similar structural and dynamic characteristics; hence much can be learned about biological complexity from engineered systems. In this article, we draw analogies between concepts in process systems engineering and conceptual models of health and disease; establish connections between these concepts and physiologic modelling; and describe how these mirror onto the physiological counterparts of engineered systems.",A chemical engineer's perspective on health and disease,Disease *** Health *** Homeostasis *** Systems engineering,computers and chemical engineering,84914103023,2014,,,,,,
"© 2014 IEEE. Uncertainties surrounding the continued operation of older coal generation units, the increased penetration of renewable resources, and the aging or retirement of certain nuclear units have exposed vulnerabilities in the natural gas supply chain. The increased availability and low price of natural gas for electric generation in many parts of the United States compounds them by increasing the economic pressure on various non-gas-fired base-load generation plants. Our growing dependence on natural gas as a primary fuel for electricity generation offers environmental and efficiency benefits, but it also presents operational challenges for independent system operators (ISOs) and regional transmission organizations (RTOs) that depend on the natural gas pipeline and storage network to facilitate reliability objectives. During the peak heating season, pipeline congestion can result in interruptions of gas deliveries to those gas-fired generators lacking primary firm entitlements. Scheduling restrictions associated with the provision of nonfirm transportation for gas-fired generators stress the capability of the electric system to meet demand and maintain operating reserves, as RTOs must quickly replace output from more efficient natural gas-fueled combined-cycle plants and quick-start peakers to maintain electric reliability. In this article, we address the gas-electric interdependencies across the Eastern Interconnection that are the subject of a multitarget research project sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) with the participation of PJM Interconnection, Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), New York Independent System Operator (NYISO), ISO New England (ISO-NE), TVA, and the Independent Electricity System Operator of Ontario (IESO), collectively known as the participating planning authorities (PPAs).",Pipeline to reliability: Unraveling gas and electric interdependencies across the eastern interconnection, ,ieee power and energy magazine,84908353978,2014,,,,,,
"© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012. Distributed resource allocation is a very important and complex problem in emerging horizontal dynamic cloud federation (HDCF) platforms, where different cloud providers (CPs) collaborate dynamically to gain economies of scale and enlargements of their virtual machine (VM) infrastructure capabilities in order to meet consumer requirements. HDCF platforms differ from the existing vertical supply chain federation (VSCF) models in terms of establishing federation and dynamic pricing. There is a need to develop algorithms that can capture this complexity and easily solve distributed VM resource allocation problem in a HDCF platform. In this paper, we propose a cooperative game-theoretic solution that is mutually beneficial to the CPs. It is shown that in non-cooperative environ-ment, the optimal aggregated benefit received by the CPs is not guaranteed. We study two utility maximizing cooperative resource allocation games in a HDCF environment. We use price-based resource allocation strategy and present both centralized and distributed algorithms to find optimal solutions to these games. Various simulations were carried out to verify the proposed algorithms. The simulation results demonstrate that the algorithms are effective, showing robust performance for resource allocation and requiring minimal computation time.",Cooperative game-based distributed resource allocation in horizontal dynamic cloud federation platform,Cooperative games *** Distributed resource allocation *** Horizontal dynamic cloud federation *** Vertical supply chain federation,information systems frontiers,84914684710,2014,,,,,,
"Purpose Managing processed food products' safety and recall is a challenge for industry and governments. Contaminated food items can create a significant public health hazard with potential for acute and chronic food borne illnesses. This industry study examines the challenges companies face while managing a processed food recall situation and devise a responsive and reliable knowledge management framework for product safety and recall supply chain for the focal global manufacturing and distribution enterprise. Method Drawing upon the knowledge management and product safety and recall literature and reliability engineering theory, this study uses a holistic single case based approach to develop a knowledge management framework with Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) decision model. This knowledge management decision framework facilitates analysis of the root causes for each potential major recall issue and assesses the reliability of the product safety and recall supply chain system and its critical components. Results The main reasons highlighted for a recall and associated failure modes in a knowledge management framework are to devise appropriate deployment of resources, technology and procedures to recall supply chain. This study underscores specific information described by managers of a global processed food manufacturer and their perspectives about the product safety and recall process, and its complexities. Full scale implementation of product safety and recall supply chain in the proposed knowledge management framework after the current pilot study will be carried out eventually through expert systems. This operational system when fully implemented will capture the essence of decision making environments comprising goals and objectives, courses of action, resources, constraints, technology and procedures. Implications The study recognizes the significance of communication, integration, failsafe knowledge management process design framework, leveraging technology such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) within all levels of supply chain for product traceability and the proactive steps to help companies successfully manage a recall process and also reestablish trust among the consumers. The proposed knowledge management framework can also preempt product recall by acting as an early warning system. A formal knowledge management framework will enable a company's knowledge be cumulative for product safety and recall and serve as an important integrating and coordinating role for the organization. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"Copyright © 2014 IGI Global. Supply chain networks have expanded globally in today’s business environment due to cost efficiencies, advanced technology, and market growth. This expansion makes the supply chains more vulnerable to disruption risks in different countries. A disruption in one country can cause serious global impacts. In this article, we formulate a multi-criteria optimization model for supporting strategic supply chain network design decisions. The modelconsiders disruption riskofsupply chain components (i.e., facilities andtransportation links)as well as profit and customer responsiveness as conflicting criteria. This consideration is important since disruption at any supply chain component may lead to the disruption of the entire supply chain network. We apply goal programming (GP) techniques to handle multiple and conflicting network design objectives. We also present a numerical example to illustrate how to incorporate disruption risk when making strategic supply chain decisions. The results demonstrate how supply chain network designs that over emphasize profit may include inexpensive supply chain components with high disruption risk. Therefore, more attention must be paid to managing potential disruptions and designing supply chain networks that balance profit and risk. We discuss tradeoffs among multiple design solutions and identify opportunities for future research.",Global Supply Chain Network Design Incorporating Disruption Risk,Disruption Risk *** Goal Programming *** Multi-Criteria Optimization *** Supply Chain Disruption *** Supply Chain Network Design,international journal of business analytics,85001731954,2014,,,,,,

Strategic network planning activities of national and even more of multinational companies are recently influenced by an increasing number of laws and regulations regarding environmental issues. On top of that non-governmental bodies pose additional pressures on companies to comply with environmental as well as social standards. Therefore, this paper presents a multi-objective and robust optimization-based closed-loop supply chain design model. In the objective function both expected total costs as well as carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) are to be minimized. Customer demands and used-product return ratio are considered to be uncertain. The model supports the decision makers to better understand the influence of parameters and their values as well as the interrelationship between these when deciding on the structure of the entire value chain.",An environmentally conscious robust closed-loop supply chain design,Multi-objective programming *** Robust optimization *** Supply chain design *** Sustainability *** Uncertainty,journal of business economics,84941938040,2014,,,,,,
"The capacitated multi-facility location problem is a complex and imprecise decision-making problem which contains both quantitative and qualitative factors. In the literature, many objectives for optimizing many types of logistics networks are described: (i) minimization objectives such as cost, inventory, transportation time, environmental impact, financial risk and (ii) maximization objectives such as profit, customer satisfaction, and flexibility and robustness. However, only a few papers have considered quantitative and qualitative factors together with imprecise methodologies. Unlike traditional cost-based optimization techniques, the approach proposed here evaluates these factors together while considering various viewpoints. Decision-makers must deal both factors together to model complex structure of real-world applications. In this paper, a two-phase possibilistic linear programming approach and a fuzzy analytical hierarchical process approach have been combined to optimize two objective functions (""minimum cost"" and ""maximum qualitative factors benefit"") in a four-stage (suppliers, plants, distribution centers, customers) supply chain network in the presence of vagueness. The results and findings of this method are illustrated with a numerical example, and the advantages of this methodology are discussed in the conclusion. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

"This article contributes to distribution system literature on three inter-linked aspects viz. formulation of a novel integrated low-carbon/green distribution system for the demand side of a Supply Chain (SC) with a single product and multiple consumers, i.e. drop-off points, a novel and robust solution approach through a Design of Experiment (DoE)-guided Multiple-Objective Particle Swarm Optimisation (MOPSO) optimiser and exhaustive analysis of the solutions (i.e. prioritisation, ranking and scenario analysis). The total costs, CO2 emission and the traversed distances of the vehicles during transportation are optimised. The optimisation model for the strategic decision-making is formulated by effectively integrating the 0-1 mixed-integer programming with a green constraint based on Analytic Hierarchy Process. Due to the computationally NP-hard characteristic of the model, a systematic and technically robust DoE-guided solution approach is designed using a commercial solver - modeFRONTIER®. DoE guides the solution through the MOPSO optimiser in order to eliminate the un-realistic set of feasible and optimal solution sets. A popular multi-attribute decision-making approach, TOPSIS, evaluates the solutions found from the Pareto optimal solution space of the solver. Finally, decision-makers preferences are analysed for monitoring the changes in the controlling parameters with respect to the changes in the decisions. A scenario analysis of the events by considering alternative possible outcomes is also conducted. It is found that the implemented methodology successfully routes the vehicles with optimal costs and low-carbon emission thus contributing to greening the environment on the demand side of a SC network. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",Integrated low-carbon distribution system for the demand side of a product distribution supply chain: A DoE-guided MOPSO optimiser-based solution approach,Low-carbon *** Multi-objective distribution system *** Particle swarm optimisation *** Single product *** Transportation *** Two-layer supply chain network,international journal of production research,84897115105,2014,,,,,,
"Purpose: Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) account for 99 % of companies operating in the European food and drink industry and, often, are part of highly fragmented and complex food chains. The article focuses on the development of a social impact assessment methodology for SMEs in selected food and drink products as part of the EU-FP7 SENSE research project. The proposed methodology employs a top-down and bottom-up approach and focuses on labour rights/working conditions along the product supply chain as the key social impact indicator, limiting key stakeholder classification to workers/employees and local communities impacted by the production process. Problems related to this emerging field are discussed, and questions for further research are expounded. Methods: The article reviews both academic and 'grey' literature on life cycle assessment (LCA) and its relationship to social LCA (S-LCA) and SMEs at the beginning of 2013 and includes case study evidence from the food sector. A pilot questionnaire survey sent to European food and drink sector SMEs and trade associations (as partners in the research project) about their knowledge, experience and engagement with social impacts is presented. Proposals are elaborated for a social impact assessment methodology that identifies the key data for SMEs to collect. Results and discussion: The literature reveals the complexity of the S-LCA approach as it aims to unite disparate and often conflicting interests. Findings from the pilot questionnaire are discussed. Using a top-down and bottom-up approach, the proposed methodology assesses data from SMEs along the supply chain in order to gauge social improvements in the management of labour-related issues for different product sectors. Issues relating to the 'attributional' choice of a social impact indicator and key stakeholder categories are discussed. How 'scoring' is interpreted and reported and what the intended effect of its use will be are also elaborated upon. Conclusions: Whilst recognising the difficulty of devising a robust social impact assessment for SMEs in the food and drink sector, it is argued that the proposed methodology makes a useful contribution in this fast-emerging field. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Social impacts and life cycle assessment: Proposals for methodological development for SMEs in the European food and drink sector,Europe *** Food and drink sector *** Life cycle assessment *** Methodologies *** S-LCA *** SMEs *** Social impacts,international journal of life cycle assessment,84899060427,2014,,,,,,
"The Egyptian economy and culture are centralized in the Greater Cairo region. Thus, it is essential that the built environment is able to withstand the possible earthquake events that may occur, and to continue to operate and function. Failure to do so would result in significant economic losses. This study presents the latter stages of a multi-tiered probabilistic earthquake loss estimation model for Greater Cairo and builds upon previous studies of the seismic hazard. In order to assess possible damage to the built environment, and the resulting economic losses, the vulnerability of the built environment is first evaluated. Through the use of satellite images, Egypts building census, previous studies and field surveys, a building-stock inventory is compiled. This building inventory is classified according to structural type and height, and is geocoded by district. Using existing fragility curves, the vulnerability of the building stock is assessed. In addition, the vulnerability of both the electricity and natural gas networks are assessed, through the use of fragility curves, cut sets and an evaluation of the supply networks. Based on the assessment of direct losses, the losses associated with building damage far exceed those associated with the considered network infrastructure. A macro-economic model is developed that takes into account damage to the built environment and provides estimates of indirect economic losses, as well as enabling the identification of the optimal recovery process. Using this model, it is shown that the indirect losses can exceed direct losses for extreme scenarios where the economy is brought to a near standstill. The framework developed and presented herein can be extended to include more networks, and is also applicable to other regions. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Earthquake loss estimation for Greater Cairo and the national economic implications,Cairo *** Direct economic loss *** Earthquake loss estimation *** Egypt *** Indirect economic loss *** Lifeline vulnerability *** Network reliability *** Recovery time,bulletin of earthquake engineering,84880645021,2013,,,,,,
"This paper presents a robust design for a multi-product, multi-echelon, closed-loop logistic network model in an uncertain environment. The model includes a general network structure considering both forward and reverse processes that can be used in various industries, such as electronics, digital equipment, and vehicles. Because logistic network design is a time consuming and costly project as well as a strategic and sensitive decision (i.e. the change of such decision is difficult in the future), a robust optimisation approach is adopted to cope with the uncertainty of demand and the return rate described by a finite set of possible scenarios. Hence, to obtain robust solutions with better time, the scenario relaxation algorithm is employed for the proposed model. Numerical examples and a sensitivity analysis are presented to demonstrate the significance and applicability of the presented model. It is shown that solutions resulted from the suggested approach insure more situations, especially in worst case ones. The results show that although the profit values of the robust configuration are less than the deterministic configuration, the robust configuration is more reliable than the deterministic one because the deterministic configuration is infeasible under some demand and return rates (i.e. in the worst cases). Moreover, the results show the computing time superiority of the algorithm compared to the extensive form model as well as optimality of the resulted solutions. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.",A robust design for a closed-loop supply chain network under an uncertain environment,Closed-loop logistic network *** Robust optimisation *** Scenario relaxation algorithm *** Supply chain management *** Uncertainty,international journal of advanced manufacturing technology,84880570741,2013,,,,,,
"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate empirically the critical factors for the diffusion of web technologies in supply chain management (SCM) functions, based on the technology-organizational-environment model, and to identify the benefits resulting from diffusion. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected, via an internet survey, from 251 respondents, ranging from middle-level to top-level managers, from firms which currently utilize web technologies for their supply chain activities. Structural equation modelling was employed for five factors: relative advantage; competitive pressure; complexity; trialability; and top management support, which have been hypothesized to affect the diffusion of web technologies in SCM functions. Findings: The results suggest that all the factors except trialability are significant predictors of web technologies' diffusion in supply chain functions. The results show also that by diffusing web technologies, organizations can enhance their supply chain activities. Research limitations/implications: The survey was conducted in a Malaysian context, using a limited set of variables, thus limiting the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications: This study provides a greater understanding of managers' perception of web technology diffusion in their organizational SCM functions, and benefits realizing from diffusion of web technology, such as operational efficiency.

"Inefficient delivery and inadequate coverage of water supply and sanitation services are major concerns for public health in the urban regions of developing countries. The contamination of the treated water within distribution system leads to frequent outbreaks of waterborne diseases. This demands a proactive approach that is based on risk assessment and a management methodology to ensure water safety. In this context, the paper presents a model study undertaken for the water supply network of a pilot area in Hyderabad city, India. The risk assessment methodology uses geospatial databases of the water supply network, sewer network, open drains, groundwater table, pressure in pipes, and soil data with a number of system-specific attributes. Fuzzy multi-criteria evaluation approach with qualitative and quantitative domain knowledge is employed in pipe condition assessment model. The physical parameters viz. pipe age, material, diameter; operational parameters viz. intermittency, number of breaks and bursts, and leakage in the system; and environmental parameters viz. workmanship, bedding condition, and traffic determine the vulnerability of pipes to contaminant intrusion. The zones of contamination formed in the soil near open drains and sewer crossings (i.e., hazards) are delineated using a contaminant ingress model. The risk of contaminant intrusion is assessed as a function of vulnerability and hazard. The results indicate that roughly 3% of pipes in the network are in Bad condition and require rehabilitation on a priority basis; about 46% of pipes are in Medium condition. The study describes a techno-economically feasible approach to assist water managers and policy makers in delivering safe drinking water. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Model study for rehabilitation planning of water supply network,Contaminant ingress *** Multi-criteria evaluation *** Pipe condition assessment *** Risk assessment *** Water distribution system,"computers, environment and urban systems",84877623189,2013,,,,,,
"Traditionally, corporate sustainability efforts have focused on the direct impacts of a company's waste or the emissions associated with its operations, buildings, and vehicles. However, the majority of the US economy's climate, water, and pollution impacts are the result of complex supply chains, strung together to deliver value-added products and services. To mitigate these indirect impacts (by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, for example) and adapt to new risks, leading companies must engage with upstream suppliers and embed sustainability as a joint objective. Companies failing to do so may suffer damage to their reputations and operations. In a changing climate, increasingly frequent and severe weather events are making supply networks more vulnerable to disruptions and unanticipated costs. Investors and other stakeholders are responding by pressuring companies to disclose and quantify emissions and other supply chain environmental impacts. Despite significant progress made by some corporations in reducing their emissions and their exposure to potential hazards hidden in upstream operations, sustainability must be a society-wide effort. © The Author(s) 2013.",Climate change: Corporate sustainability in the supply chain,Climate change *** Corporate sustainability *** Globalization *** Natural catastrophes *** Reputation *** Superstorm *** Supply chain,bulletin of the atomic scientists,84879364609,2013,,,,,,
"This article seeks to offer a systematic approach to establishing a reliable network of facilities in closed loop supply chains (CLSCs) under uncertainties. Facilities that are located in this article concurrently satisfy both traditional objective functions and reliability considerations in CLSC network designs. To attack this problem, a novel mathematical model is developed that integrates the network design decisions in both forward and reverse supply chain networks. The model also utilizes an effective reliability approach to find a robust network design. In order to make the results of this article more realistic, a CLSC for a case study in the iron and steel industry has been explored. The considered CLSC is multi-echelon, multi-facility, multi-product and multi-supplier. Furthermore, multiple facilities exist in the reverse logistics network leading to high complexities. Since the collection centres play an important role in this network, the reliability concept of these facilities is taken into consideration. To solve the proposed model, a novel interactive hybrid solution methodology is developed by combining a number of efficient solution approaches from the recent literature. The proposed solution methodology is a bi-objective interval fuzzy possibilistic chance-constraint mixed integer linear programming (BOIFPCCMILP). Finally, computational experiments are provided to demonstrate the applicability and suitability of the proposed model in a supply chain environment and to help decision makers facilitate their analyses. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Reliable design of a closed loop supply chain network under uncertainty: An interval fuzzy possibilistic chance-constrained model,chance-constrained programming *** closed loop supply chain *** fuzzy possibilistic *** interval programming *** network design *** reliability,engineering optimization,84878320783,2013,,,,,,
"Industrial ecosystems improve eco-efficiency at the system level through optimizing material and energy flows, which however raises a concern for system resilience because efficiency, as traditionally conceived, not necessarily promotes resilience. By drawing on the concept of resilience in ecological systems and in supply chains, resilience in industrial ecosystems is specified on the basis of a system's ability to maintain eco-efficient material and energy flows under disruptions. Using a network model that captures supply, asset, and organizational dependencies and propagation of disruptions among firms, the resilience, and particularly resistance as an important dimension of resilience, of two real industrial ecosystems and generalized specifications are examined. The results show that an industrial ecosystem is less resistant and less resilient with high inter-firm dependency, preferentially organized physical exchanges, and under disruptions targeted at highly connected firms. An industrial ecosystem with more firms and exchanges is less resistant, but has more eco-efficient flows and potentials, and therefore is less likely to lose its function of eco-efficiency. Taking these determinants for resilience into consideration improves the adaptability of an industrial ecosystem, which helps increase its resilience. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Exploring the resilience of industrial ecosystems,Adaptability *** Industrial symbiosis *** Material and energy flow *** Network structure *** Resilience *** Resistance,journal of environmental management,84875822364,2013,,,,,,
"The growing complexity of transport chains with the development of the macro-economic context have imposed a growing pressure on ports as critical nodes inserted in global supply chains. Port activities have an important social, economic and environmental impact on neighbouring regions. Ports definitely generate added value and employment. However, at the same time, local populations increasingly perceive them as factors of negative externalities such as environmental pollution, security risks and traffic congestion. Their complex role in transport networks as well as in local territories inevitably makes seaports a great source of ""conflicts"". Various authors have already approached this topic adopting a stakeholder view, but only in relation to specific contexts and case studies and from a mono-disciplinary perspective.The aim of the paper is to investigate the nature and the dynamics of the major conflicts arising in ports. The manuscript, indeed, sets out the various types of port conflicts (e.g., social, institutional, operational, land use, etc.) and the diverse conflict processes impacting on port management.This study shows the results of preliminary fieldwork carried out in some selected ports in France and Italy. The outcomes result from interviews, press articles as well as from a critical analysis of the existing literature. The discussion leads to the definition of a typology of port conflicts, an analysis of conflict mechanisms and the set up of an agenda for further research. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Origin and taxonomy of conflicts in seaports: Towards a research agenda,Conflicts *** Governance *** Ports *** Public-private interactions,research in transportation business and management,84885949547,2013,,,,,,
"This article provides a quality check of the degrowth movement's proposal of local currencies as tools for advancing socially equitable and ecologically sustainable degrowth. The article draws comprehensively upon mainly English-language academic research about four widespread local currency types - LETS, time banks, HOUR currencies, and convertible local currencies (CLCs) - to assess their performance with respect to four degrowth-related criteria: community-building, advancement of alternative values in economic exchange, facilitation of alternative livelihoods, and eco-localization. LETS have been found to support alternative livelihoods under quite uncommon conditions, and contribute indirectly to eco-localization by moderately facilitating informal resale, repair, and sharing of commercially produced goods, although their burdensome management and confinement to small memberships limit their usefulness. Time banks help expand social networks, and are best at reaching the socially excluded. However, they are confined to unskilled personal services and dependent on grant funding. HOUR currencies do not stand out with regard to any criteria, but may have a minor capacity to promote local purchasing. CLCs are best at attracting local businesses, but no significant evidence of their said capacity to localize supply chains has surfaced as yet, and their business-friendly design works to the detriment of other criteria. In sum, existing research provides a very weak basis for advocating local currencies as tools for purposive degrowth. Local currencies are here categorized as two utopian socialist approaches: the behind-society's-back variety of LETS and HOUR currencies, and the appeal-to-elites variety of time banks and CLCs. Marx and Engels's critiques of these approaches remain valid: successful monetary systems require resources that are not available behind society's back, notably the power to levy taxes and designate by which means they can be paid. Local currencies that appeal for elite support - without mass popular backing - have shaken off most radical connotations, and are vulnerable to changing policy agendas. Given the present historical conjuncture of popular outrage against the banking sector, this paper argues that the degrowth movement would improve its chances of contributing to purposive degrowth by prioritizing government-centred ecological reform of the monetary system over local currencies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"Reverse logistics networks are often implemented to ensure a sustainable product or material recovery and to improve a company's sustainability footprint. The most common approach for designing bi-directional networks is the independent design of reverse and forward networks. The joint integration of both networks is rarely considered. Here we study a strategic capacitated facility location problem with integrated bi-directional product flows through a network of multiple supply stages, including production allocations, uncertain data development, facility locations and flexible capacity adjustments. We extend the location and capacity problem by including the decision on the type of depot to install. Forwarding or collecting depots only process one designated direction. Hybrid sites process products of both flow directions. We first introduce a detailed deterministic model assessing the impact of incorporating reverse logistics into a forward-oriented supply chain. This is then extended to a robust capacitated facility location model, which minimizes the expectations of relative regrets for a set of scenarios over a multi-period planning horizon, while considering uncertainty regarding supplying and collecting goods. Example settings show the superior performance of the robust model compared to the deterministic model. The resulting network design mitigates the risks of higher costs and of not being able to fully satisfy demand. This is achieved at costs not significantly higher than the individual optimal solution and with solution times that are promising for applications in practice. The approach supports practitioners in assessing the flexibility of their supply chain, independent of its product flow direction, when operating under uncertainty.",Robust sustainable bi-directional logistics network design under uncertainty,Facility location *** Reverse logistics *** Robust optimization *** Supply chain design *** Sustainability *** Uncertainty,international journal of production economics,84880916494,2013,,,,,,
"Within the supply chain context, schedule instability is caused by revisions to forecast demand from customers, problems with scheduled deliveries from suppliers, and disruptions to internal production. Supply chain partners attempt to address schedule instability by regular exchanges of information flows on current demand and delivery forecasts. However, if these updating information flows are unreliable and likely to be over-ridden by subsequent updated schedules, then the problem of schedule instability at the supplier-customer interface is not being solved. The research hypothesis investigated in this paper is whether supply chain partners may reduce schedule instability at the supplier-customer interface by identifying and omitting complexity-adding information flows. To this aim, previous work by the authors on an information-theoretic methodology for measuring complexity is extended and applied in this paper for identifying complexity-adding information flows. The application consists of comparing the complexity index of actual exchanged information flows with the complexity index of scenarios that omit one or more of these information flows. Using empirical results, it is shown that supply chain partners may reduce schedule instability at the supplier-customer interface by identifying and omitting complexity-adding information flows. The applied methodology is independent of the information systems used by the supplier and customer, and it provides an objective, integrative measure of schedule instability at the supplier-customer interface. Two case studies are presented, one in the commodity production environment of fast-moving consumer goods, and another in the customised production environment of electronic products sector. By applying the measurement and analysis methodology, relevant schedule instability-related insights about the specific case-studies are obtained. In light of the findings from these case studies, areas for further research and validation of the conditions in which the proposed research hypothesis holds are also proposed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Reducing schedule instability by identifying and omitting complexity-adding information flows at the supplier-customer interface,Case studies *** Entropy *** Information flows *** Operational complexity *** Schedule instability *** Supplier-customer interface,international journal of production economics,84880924324,2013,,,,,,
"While the cybersecurity field has focused primarily on software and network security, threats and vulnerabilities of hardware device supply chains are growing concerns. Of particular importance and interest in this vein is the way in which semiconductors and other electronic devices are increasingly deployed to support energy distribution, storage, and control at a variety of scales. Future smart grid supply chains must be secured to prevent cyber attacks from affecting energy infrastructure, and the societal and economic functions on which they depend. This perspective paper calls for a multiscale approach to address modeling and decision-making for energy system hardware supply chains. A multiscale approach, as discussed in this paper, can facilitate resilience of supply chains across the life cycles of these systems, through low- and high-tech techniques to monitor and act on the supply chain. This can incorporate both qualitative and quantitative factors to suit the variety of stakeholders, geographic scales, organizational levels, and planning and operational time horizons. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Multiscale approach to the security of hardware supply chains for energy systems,Counterfeiting *** Energy systems *** Multiscale *** Resilience *** Risk *** Smart grid *** Supply chain *** Sustainability,environment systems and decisions,84885030914,2013,,,,,,
"Based upon an increasing academic and business interest in greening the industrial supply chains, this paper establishes the need for a state-of-the-art decision support system (DSS) for carbon emissions accounting and management, mainly across the product supply chains by identifying methodological shortcomings in existing tools, and proposing a supply chain (SC) framework which provide businesses with a holistic understanding of their supply chains and ensuring partners within supply chain collaborative networks have a shared understanding of their emissions. It describes the design and development of a DSS now known as supply chain environmental analysis tool (SCEnAT) in detail, putting its unique and innovative features into a comparative perspective vis-à-vis existing tools and software of different types. The methodological framework used to design and develop SCEnAT integrates different individual techniques/methods of supply chain (SC) mapping, SC carbon accounting, SC interventions and SC interventions evaluation on a range of key performance indicators (KPIs). These individual methods have been used and applied innovatively to the challenge of designing SCEnAT within the desired framework. Finally, we demonstrate the application of SCEnAT, especially the advantage of using a robust carbon accounting methodology, to a SC case study. The SCEnAT framework pushes the theoretical boundary by addressing the problems of intra-organisational approach in decision making for lowering carbon along the supply chain; with an open innovation, cutting edge, hybridised framework that considers the supply chain as a whole in co-decision making for lowering carbon along the supply chain with the most robust methodology of hybrid life cycle analysis (LCA) that considers direct and indirect emissions and interventional performance evaluation for low carbon technology investment and business case building in order to adapt and mitigate climate change problems.

"To provide a competitive edge in today's conditions of globalization businesses are required to go beyond the classical methods. When we take into account the basic structure of the contemporary value chain and its importance, we can describe supply chains as ""Outstanding Competitiveness Creator Source"" for businesses. In this context this can be said that a supply chain network design decision whis has a strategic importance in all processes inculiding procurement of raw materials, manufactured products and services delivered to the customer, even after sales services is a critical decision for businesses. On the other hand because of the awareness of customers, being more searching and questioning and taking into account not only ergonomics but also the environmental impact of products in the information society, businesses are required to make environmentally sensitive activities in all conducting business processes. In this study, a model is proposed for the design of a supply chain distribution network that may be suitable for new business processes which are shaped by globalization and the information society's effect. The model includes raw material supply, production, distribution, recycling activities design as flexible and environmentally sensitive processes for a product with more than one component.","A mixed integer linear programming model proposal for network design of a multi-phase, environmental and flexible closed loop supply chain",A mixed integer linear programming *** A supply chain network desing *** Environmentally sensitivity *** Flexibility,mediterranean journal of social sciences,84892535081,2013,,,,,,
"Purpose: Low-carbon economy requires the pursuit of eco-efficiency, which is a win-win situation between economic and environmental efficiency. In this paper the question of trading off the economic and environmental effects embodied in eco-efficiency in the hybrid manufacturing/remanufacturing logistics network design in the context of low-carbon economy is examined. Design/methodology/approach: A multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model to find the optimal facility locations and materials flow allocation is established. In the objective function, three minimum targets are set: economic cost, CO2 emission and waste generation. Through an iterative algorithm, the Pareto Boundary of the problem is obtained. Findings: The results of numeric study show that in order to achieve a Pareto improvement over an original system, three of the critical rates (i.e. return rate, recovery rate, and cost substitute rate) should be increased. Practical implications: To meet the need of low-carbon dioxide, an iso- CO2 emission curve in which decision makers have a series of optimal choices with the same CO2 emission but different cost and waste generation is plotted. Each choice may have different network design but all of these are Pareto optimal solutions, which provide a comprehensive evaluation of both economics and ecology for the decision making. Originality/value: This research chooses carbon emission as one of the three objective functions and uses Pareto sets to analyze how to balance profitability and environmental impacts in designing remanufacturing closed-loop supply chain in the context of low-carbon economy.",Eco-efficient based logistics network design in hybrid manufacturing/ remanufacturing system in low-carbon economy,Eco-efficiency *** Hybrid manufacturing/remanufacturing system *** Logistic network design *** Low-carbon economy *** Pareto improvement *** Tradeoff,journal of industrial engineering and management,84875503957,2013,,,,,,
"In this article, I present a review and tutorial of the literature on closed-loop supply chains, which are supply chains where, in addition to typical forward flows, there are reverse flows of used products (postconsumer use) back to manufacturers. Examples include supply chains with consumer returns, leasing options, and end-of-use returns with remanufacturing. I classify the literature in terms of strategic, tactical, and operational issues, but I focus on strategic issues (such as when should an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) remanufacture, response to take-back legislation, and network design, among others) and tactical issues (used product acquisition and disposition decisions).

"The presented approach aims to overcome the scarce data problem in service life modeling of water networks by combining subjective expert knowledge and local replacement data. A procedure to elicit imprecise quantile estimates of survival functions from experts, considering common cognitive biases, was developed and applied. The individual expert priors of the parameters of the service life distribution are obtained by regression over the stated distribution quantiles and aggregated into a single prior distribution. Furthermore, a likelihood function for the commonly encountered censored and truncated pipe replacement data is formulated. The suitability of the suggested Bayesian approach based on elicitation data from eight experts and real network data is demonstrated. Robust parameter estimates could be derived in data situations where frequentist maximum likelihood estimation is unsatisfactory, and to show how the consideration of imprecision and in-between-variance of experts improves posterior inference. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Combining expert knowledge and local data for improved service life modeling of water supply networks,Bayesian inference *** Expert aggregation *** Expert knowledge elicitation *** Scarce data *** Service life modeling *** Water supply network,environmental modelling and software,84874515592,2013,,,,,,
"Building energy assessment is usually performed based on fundamentals of the First Law of Thermodynamics, which is especially concerned on quantitative energy aspects. However, this approach does not provide a faithful thermodynamic evaluation of the overall energy conversion processes that occur in buildings, and a more robust approach should be followed. The exergy analysis is a useful method that combines First Law and Second Law perspectives and has been applied in many related engineering fields, power plants analysis, CHP systems, heat pumps or building energy systems. In this study, the overall energy and exergy performance of eight space heating options is compared for different outdoor environmental conditions. The methodology follows an approach from demand (at building envelope) to supply side (primary energy supplied), assuming that each energy supply network (ESN) or heating option is divided into the following sub-systems: room, emission, heat generator and power plant. The related energy and exergy performance of each ESN is evaluated through the following indicators: primary energy ratio (PER) and primary exergy ratio (PExR). The results show that for similar primary energy performance, PExR may assume distinct values depending on outdoor environmental conditions. The most energy efficient ESN has a PER of 2.2, while the related PExR changes from 7% to 16% for Lisbon and Berlin, respectively. Furthermore, the assessment of irreversibility rate associated to each ESN sub-system reveals the sources of inefficiencies could be pinpointed and measured, leading to tangible suggestions for further improvements. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Comparative energy and exergy performance of heating options in buildings under different climatic conditions,Exergy analysis *** Irreversibility rate *** Primary energy ratio *** Primary exergy ratio *** TRNSYS,energy and buildings,84875182942,2013,,,,,,
"Free and open source software (FOSS) solutions are not only considered to be a disruptive force in the proprietary software industry but have helped firms deliver efficient and proficient processes and position themselves in global supply networks. The purpose of this study was to conduct an investigation of FOSS adoption in firms operating in high-velocity environments and identify factors that have an impact on the adoption process. Primary data were gathered from a cluster of firms operating in a high-velocity environment. The results provide an insight about the FOSS adoption process to both practitioners and academics alike. Our results indicate that performance attitude of managers, data regulation and facilitating conditions are important determinants of a firm's behavioural intention (BI) to adopt and use FOSS. Interestingly, influences from social and organisational domains have little effect on a firm's BI to adopt FOSS solutions. Overall, the article provides a structure to FOSS adoption which is relevant to managers and academics. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",Adoption of free and open source software within high-velocity firms,behavioural intentions *** TAM *** technology acceptance model,behaviour and information technology,84874585200,2013,,,,,,
"Transport networks have to provide carriers with time-efficient alternative routes in case of disruptions. It is, therefore, essential for transport network planners and operators to identify sections within the network which, if broken, have a considerable negative impact on the network's performance. Research on transport network analysis provides lots of different approaches and models in order to identify such critical sections. Most of them, however, are only applicable to mono-modal transport networks and calculate indices which represent the criticality of sections by using aggregated data. The model presented, in contrast, focuses on the analysis of intermodal transport networks by using a traffic micro simulation. Based on available, real-life data, our approach models a transport network as well as its actual traffic participants and their individual decisions in case of a disruption. The resulting transport delay time due to a specific disruption helps to identify critical sections and critical networks, as a whole. Therefore, the results are a valuable decision support for transport network planners and operators in order to make the infrastructure less vulnerable, more attractive for carriers and thus more economically sustainable. In order to show the applicability of the model we analyse the Austrian intermodal transport network and show how critical sections can be evaluated by this approach. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Analysing the impact of disruptions in intermodal transport networks: A micro simulation-based model,Intermodal transport network *** Network vulnerability *** Supply chain disruption *** Traffic micro simulation *** Transport network analysis,decision support systems,84875211538,2013,,,,,,
"Material cycles have become increasingly coupled and interconnected in a globalizing era. While material flow analysis (MFA) has been widely used to characterize stocks and flows along technological life cycle within a specific geographical area, trade networks among individual cycles have remained largely unexplored. Here we developed a trade-linked multilevel MFA model to map the contemporary global journey of anthropogenic aluminum. We demonstrate that the anthropogenic aluminum cycle depends substantially on international trade of aluminum in all forms and becomes highly interconnected in nature. While the Southern hemisphere is the main primary resource supplier, aluminum production and consumption concentrate in the Northern hemisphere, where we also find the largest potential for recycling. The more developed countries tend to have a substantial and increasing presence throughout the stages after bauxite refining and possess highly consumption-based cycles, thus maintaining advantages both economically and environmentally. A small group of countries plays a key role in the global redistribution of aluminum and in the connectivity of the network, which may render some countries vulnerable to supply disruption. The model provides potential insights to inform government and industry policies in resource criticality, supply chain security, value chain management, and cross-boundary environmental impacts mitigation. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",Mapping the global journey of anthropogenic aluminum: A trade-linked multilevel material flow analysis, ,environmental science and technology,84886886905,2013,,,,,,
"For a regional port necessarily involved in global supply chains, the development of its hinterland region is critical to its long term sustainability. Such development can be fostered by a regional innovation system (RIS), although the risks of path dependency and lock-in may lead to a region decaying. A process for contributing to a RIS is the Regional Development Platform Model (RDPM), the focus of this paper. As a new approach to regional development, the RDPM is utilised and adapted to identify opportunities for potential development in a region. In this paper, the RDPM is linked to the role of a port authority and its potential to drive regional growth centred on its innovation network. Port authorities, by assuming the role of network leader, can shape the regional innovation network and create new development trajectories through their links to various levels of government and the wide range of stakeholders that utilise the port facilities. The inherent tensions in this role and the competing possibilities of path creation and path dependence to create value for a wide network of stakeholders are challenging.The paper investigates the use of the RDPM and how port authorities can influence development strategies for mutual benefit in this context. More specifically, a case study of the Burnie Port in Tasmania, Australia is conducted by utilising desktop research, interviews, an expert panel and industry roundtable to demonstrate that the RDPM has the potential as an approach beyond analysing the main sources of path dependency in a local region. By following the adaptation of the RDPM, it is argued that the trajectory of path dependency can be interrupted, for example by a port authority, enabling the potential for new paths to be created. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Regional port authorities: Leading players in innovation networks?,Path dependency *** Port strategy *** Regional development platform method *** Regional innovation system,journal of transport geography,84872393250,2013,,,,,,
"In today's highly dynamic and competitive environment, companies are under the pressure to improve their supply chain strategy in order to be more responsive to customer demand. However, supply chains are susceptible to unanticipated events that make responsive supply chain management a challenging task. One such disruption event is a product stockout at the retailer. In this paper, we investigate retail stockouts through the development of an agent-based simulation model in order to develop a better understanding of the effect of different stockout lengths for different products (with different consumer response profiles to stockouts) on both the retailer and the manufacturer of the product. We consider the change of market share as a measure of resilience for both the manufacturer and the retailer to examine the impact of the stockout. Insights are developed for manufacturers and retailers in responding to the stockout disruption. © 1988-2012 IEEE.",Supply chain risk management: An agent-based simulation to study the impact of retail stockouts,Agent-based simulation *** consumer response *** market share *** retail stockout *** supply network disruption management,ieee transactions on engineering management,84886727895,2013,,,,,,
"Because the supply network of an enterprise should be flexible enough to capture and overcome market dynamics, one of the major concerns of global enterprises is to make their supply network reconfigurable. Although many strategies for flexible management of a supply network have been proposed, especially for mitigating supply network risks, it still remains unclear how to apply the strategies to a supply network and how to reconfigure the supply network. This paper examines the influence of flexibility strategies in a dynamic global market environment on the structure of supply network, and proposes a method of reconfiguring the supply network of an enterprise to cope with its flexibility strategies. A reconfigurable supply network model is proposed, and flexibility strategies are classified, and critical indices of strategies are defined. In the proposed model, each business actor is defined as a network node and each node has its own goal. A node optimizes its goal to reduce and overcome the risk of market environments. The result of optimization indicates that the supply network structure is reconfigured dynamically. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"Summary: A dissolved air flotation (DAF) system upgrade was proposed for an urban paper mill to recycle effluent. To understand the influence of operating variables on the environmental impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and water consumption, a dynamic supply chain model was linked with life cycle assessment (LCA) to produce an environmental inventory. Water is a critical natural resource, and understanding the environmental impacts of recycling water is paramount in continued development of sustainable supply chains involving water. The methodology used in this study bridged the gap between detailed process models and static LCA modeling so that operating variables beyond discrete scenario analysis could be investigated without creating unnecessarily complex models. The model performed well in evaluating environmental impacts. It was found that there was no single optimum operating regime for all environmental impacts. For a mill discharging 80 cubic meters of effluent per hour (m3/hour), GHGs could be minimized with a DAF capacity of 17.5 m3/hour, while water consumption could be minimized with a DAF capacity of 25 m3/hour, which allowed insight into where environmental trade-offs would occur. The study shows that more complexity can be achieved in supply chain modeling without requiring a full technical model. It also illustrates the need to consider multiple environmental impacts and highlights the trade-off of GHG emissions with water consumption in water recycling. The supply chain model used in this water treatment case study was able to identify the environmental trade-offs from the operating variables selected. © 2013 by Yale University.",Life cycle assessment of advanced industrial wastewater treatment within an urban environment,Dissolved air flotation *** Industrial ecology *** Life cycle inventory (LCI) *** Pulp and paper *** Water recycling *** Water reuse,journal of industrial ecology,84885478011,2013,,,,,,
"The unexpected incident in supply chain is occurred unexpectedly under some control of certain accident factors, causes serious damage or effect and need immediate processing. However, this tendency of supply chain network complexity intensifies the uncertainty of supply chain network's operating environment; any node in the supply chain network occurs unexpected incident which will soon affect the associated upstream and downstream enterprises and then affect the all enterprises on the network. For cascading problems of supply chain, this study proposed a capacity reallocation strategy with local and global information integrated. Based on this strategy, three attacking methods were adopted to simulate emergency events of supply chain and the vulnerability of supply chain network is measured through maximum connected subgraph and network efficiency. The experimental results show that the reallocation strategy put forward is practical and highly efficient. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.",Supply-chain dynamic invulnerability research based on node failure,Capacity allocation *** Network attacks *** Node failure *** Supply chain,information technology journal,84879369565,2013,,,,,,
"Electric power supply companies increasingly rely on enterprise IT systems to provide them with a comprehensive view of the state of the distribution network. Within a utility-wide network, enterprise IT systems collect data from various metering devices. Such data can be effectively used for the prediction of power supply network vulnerability. The purpose of this paper is to present the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)-based Sensor Web integration solution that we have developed with the purpose of enabling prediction of power supply network vulnerability, in terms of a prediction of defect probability for a particular network element. We will give an example of its usage and demonstrate our vulnerability prediction model on data collected from two different power supply companies. The proposed solution is an extension of the GinisSense Sensor Web-based architecture for collecting, processing, analyzing, decision making and alerting based on the data received from heterogeneous data sources. In this case, GinisSense has been upgraded to be capable of operating in an ESB environment and combine Sensor Web and GIS technologies to enable prediction of electric power supply system vulnerability. Aside from electrical values, the proposed solution gathers ambient values from additional sensors installed in the existing power supply network infrastructure. GinisSense aggregates gathered data according to an adapted Omnibus data fusion model and applies decision-making logic on the aggregated data.

"Green supply chain management consists of companies applying green concepts to managing their supply chains. It is a new way to enhance company competitiveness. In particular, reverse logistics aims to optimize reverse product flows to limit residual waste. One of the most critical problems in the reverse logistics field is the design of reverse logistic networks. The purpose of this work is to propose a comprehensive generic model that can help decision makers to design networks that cover remanufacturing activities. This model also aims to help devise strategies for the pricing of used and remanufactured products.

Therefore, both economic and ecological costs of reverse logistic activities are taken into account to help minimize the damages of the reverse supply chain on the environment.

"This paper aims at conceptualising and assessing operational environment of small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) in sustainable supply chains in regional context. The paper starts an attempt to explore how SMEs in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in Germany from transport, logistics related value-added services and especially from the air freight sector collaborate, perform and develop from supply chain management perspective, and what crucial determinants for burgeoning business performance and sustainable strategy are effectively to be linked for the benefits of SMEs. Using a qualitative case study approach, the paper bears on empirical evidences of the project ""Baltic.AirCargo.Net"" financed by the European Regional Development F und / European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument in the framework of the Baltic Sea Region Programme 2007-2013. The paper builds upon a qualitative research approach involving expert interviews, focus groups analysis and secondary data research based on relevant project documentation and field notes from project meetings and workshops. F indings of the case study from the German air cargo service providers are explored and discussed through key theoretical concepts pertaining to sustainable supply chains and logistics of SMEs. Based on the relevant scholarly work and results of empirical evidence and case studies, a conceptual model is designed with propositions and possible future directions for SMEs.

"Purpose: The integration of business processes across multiple companies can provide economic benefits, thus ensuring the sustainability of the involved companies. However these advantages are accompanied by many potential risks. For instance, emerging disruptions within a supply chain can spread over several partners resulting in economic losses. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the development of a collaborative cross-supply chain framework that reduces the extent of loss after the occurrence of unforeseen damaging events in sensitive logistics nodes. Design/methodology/approach: To handle the impacts of unforeseen damaging events in sensitive logistics nodes, the focus of our approach lies on the implementation of a collaboratively applicable concept for sensitive logistics nodes that supports a rapid collaborative decision-making among the partners. Therefore, different damaging events as well as the logistics and transport processes in freight villages are determined and implemented in an agent-based simulation model. Findings: Multi-agent simulation can be used for a scenario-based collaborative risk management in sensitive logistics nodes. By executing simulation experiments the impacts of selected damaging events can be analysed and used for the development of scenario specific strategies for the partners in sensitive logistics nodes with the objective to maintain the flow of goods after disturbances. Practical implications: The paper proposes a multi-agent simulation, which can be used collaboratively in a cross-supply chain team to support decision-making processes in sensitive logistics nodes after a disruption has occurred. To get an effective and efficient tool, involved companies are included into the development and implementation processes.

"The efficient and effective movement of goods from raw material sites to processing facilities, component fabrication plants, finished goods assembly plants, distribution centres, retailers and customers are critical in today's competitive environment. These in turn depend on facility location decisions taken during strategic planning. These facilities are expensive to construct and difficult to modify. Inefficient locations for production and assembly plants as well as distribution centres will result in excess costs being incurred throughout the lifetime of the facilities, no matter how well the production plans, transportation options, inventory management, and information sharing decisions are optimised in response to changing conditions. This paper addresses design of network model for facility location and capacity allocation where in a set of customer locations with demands and a set of candidate facility locations will be known in advance. If a facility is located at a candidate site, a known fixed location cost is incurred. There is a known unit shipment cost between each candidate site and each customer location. The problem is to find the locations of the facilities and the shipment pattern between the facilities and the customers to minimise the combined facility location and shipment costs subject to a requirement that all customer demands be met. To optimise this, the distribution network model is mathematically represented and solved using hybrid PSO algorithm. © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Constrained optimisation of distribution network using new hybrid PSO optimiser,Capacitated plant location model *** Hybrid PSO *** Supply chain network,international journal of business and systems research,84901055972,2013,,,,,,
"This paper provides a methodology for supply chain network (SCN) design under uncertainty. The problem is initially casted as a two-level organizational decision process: the design decisions must be made here and now, but the reengineered SCN can be used for daily operations only after an implementation period. The network structure can also be adapted during the planning horizon considered. When making the design decisions, the operational response and structural adaptation decisions taking place during the planning horizon must be anticipated. The methodology recognizes three event types to characterize the future SCN environment: random, hazardous and deep uncertainty events. At the design time, plausible futures are anticipated through a scenario planning approach. Several Monte Carlo scenario samples are generated and corresponding sample average approximation programs are solved in order to produce a set of alternative designs. A multi-criteria design evaluation approach is then applied to select the most effective and robust design among candidate solutions. An illustrative case, based on the location-transportation problem, is finally introduced to illustrate the approach, and computational experiments are performed to demonstrate its feasibility. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",The design of robust value-creating supply chain networks,Anticipation *** Multi-hazards *** Network disruptions *** Robustness *** Scenario planning *** Stochastic programming *** Supply chain network design *** Uncertainty,or spectrum,84888043656,2013,,,,,,
"Facility location, inventory control, and vehicle routes scheduling are critical and highly related problems in the design of logistics system for e-business. Meanwhile, the return ratio in Internet sales was significantly higher than in the traditional business. Many of returned merchandise have no quality defects, which can reenter sales channels just after a simple repackaging process. Focusing on the existing problem in e-commerce logistics system, we formulate a location-inventory-routing problem model with no quality defects returns. To solve this NP-hard problem, an effective hybrid genetic simulated annealing algorithm (HGSAA) is proposed. Results of numerical examples show that HGSAA outperforms GA on computing time, optimal solution, and computing stability. The proposed model is very useful to help managers make the right decisions under e-supply chain environment.",A Hybrid Genetic-Simulated Annealing Algorithm for the Location-Inventory-Routing Problem Considering Returns under E-Supply Chain Environment, ,scientific world journal,WOS:000329636100001,2013,,,,,,
"Purpose: In the context of progress of sustainability science, life cycle thinking and, in particular, life cycle sustainability assessment may play a crucial role. Environmental, economic and social implications of the whole supply chain of products, both goods and services, their use and waste management, i.e. their entire life cycle from ""cradle to grave"" have to be considered to achieve more sustainable production and consumption patterns. Progress toward sustainability requires enhancing the methodologies for integrated assessment and mainstreaming of life cycle thinking from product development to strategic policy support. Life cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle costing (LCC) and social LCA (sLCA) already attempt to cover sustainability pillars, notwithstanding different levels of methodological development. An increasing concern on how to deal with the complexity of sustainability has promoted the development of life cycle sustainability frameworks. As a contribution to the ongoing scientific debate after the Rio+20 conference, this paper aims to present and discuss the state of the art of life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA), giving recommendations for its further development in line with ontological, epistemological and methodological aspects of sustainability science. Methods: Building on the review about the state of the art of sustainability science and sustainability assessment methods presented in part I, this paper discuss LCA, LCC, sLCA and LCSA against ontological, epistemological and methodological aspects of ongoing scientific debate on sustainability. Strengths and weaknesses of existing life cycle-based methodologies and methods are presented. Besides, existing frameworks for LCSA are evaluated against the criteria defined in part I in order to highlight coherence with sustainability science progress and to support better integration and mainstreaming of sustainability concepts. Conclusions and outlook: LCSA represents a promising approach for developing a transparent, robust and comprehensive assessment. Nevertheless, the ongoing developments should be in line with the most advanced scientific discussion on sustainability science, attempting to bridge the gaps between the current methods and methodologies for sustainability assessment. LCSA should develop so as to be hierarchically different from LCA, LCC and sLCA. It should represent the holistic approach which integrates (and not substitutes) the reductionist approach of the single part of the analysis. This implies maintaining the balance between analytical and descriptive approaches towards a goal and solution-oriented decision support methodology. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Life cycle sustainability assessment in the context of sustainability science progress (part 2),Life cycle sustainability assessment *** Science-policy interface *** Stakeholder involvement *** Sustainability science *** Value choices,international journal of life cycle assessment,84888643124,2013,,,,,,
"Purpose - Although outsourcing has emerged as a key business practice in global supply chain management it has not always been successfully adopted. Since the reasons for outsourcing success and failure are underexplored this research aims to investigate the role of contractual completeness and complementary enforcement practices such as cooperation and monitoring and sanctioning practices under varying risk scenarios. Critically, these relationships are examined in the context of two serious risks: legal risk in the guise of rule of law and supplier non-conformance risk. Design/methodology/approach - Cross-county, survey data was collected through the global manufacturing research group and combined with secondary data from the World Bank. The authors carried out a series of regression analysis to explore their research questions. Findings - The results indicate that risk is a critical component of outsourcing success with legal risk reducing outsourcing performance on both cost and quality and supplier risk reducing outsourcing performance on quality. The results also indicate that these outcomes can be mitigated in some settings via complete contracts and complementary practices. These findings are likely to be generalized throughout the supply chain and are of relevance beyond the dyad. Originality/value - In the realm of supply chain practices this study presents a comprehensive attempt to assess the importance of risk and complementary practices for the success of outsourcing contracts. Furthermore, it assesses the role of contextual factors such as risk and the rule of law.",The importance of contextual factors in the success of outsourcing contracts in the supply chain environment: the role of risk and complementary practices,Outsourcing *** Supply chain management *** Risk *** Contracts,supply chain management-an international journal,WOS:000327003400005,2013,,,,,,
"Purpose This research aims to provide a theoretical framework for exploring how firms can respond to the growing threat of natural resource scarcity. Specifically, the role of closed-loop supply chain management is examined as a means for creating resource advantages that can lead to marketplace competitive advantages. Design/methodology/approach - The research extends previous theoretical research, integrating natural resource scarcity and closed-loop supply chain management for the first time. Resource-advantage theory is employed as the theoretical lens for the research model and propositions. Findings - The findings deepen understanding of the forces that create natural resource scarcity conditions in the supply chain, and highlight the need for higher order closed-loop capabilities that have the ability to mitigate natural resource scarcity. Research limitations/implications - The theoretical model and six research propositions suggest relationships between natural resource scarcity, closed-loop capabilities, and firm level performance that need to be tested empirically. Future research opportunities and methodologies are suggested. Practical implications - Growing natural resource scarcity is already having a major impact on many firms and industries; therefore, this research has significant managerial implications due to supply risks and potential disruptions caused by insufficient natural resources in current and future supply chains. Originality/value - This paper seeks to increase discussion about natural resource scarcity and bring it into focus as a relevant supply chain topic related to closed-loop supply chain capabilities and the internal firm level resources needed to ensure performance in a changing world.",Natural resource scarcity and the closed-loop supply chain: a resource-advantage view,Natural resource scarcity *** Closed-loop supply chain *** Resource advantage *** Supply chain management *** Supply chain risk *** Resource management *** Natural resources,international journal of physical distribution & logistics management,WOS:000332269500002,2013,,,,,,
"Supply chain management is important for companies and organizations to improve their business and enhance competitiveness in the global marketplace. The bullwhip effect problem of supply chain systems with vendor order placement lead time delays in an uncertain environment is addressed in this paper. Among the numerous causes of bullwhip effect, we focus on uncertainties with respect to demand, production process, supply chain structure, inventory policy implementation and especially vendor order placement lead time delays. Minimizing the negative effect of these uncertainties in inducing bullwhip effect creates a need for developing dynamical inventory policy that increases responsiveness to demand and decreases volatility in inventory replenishment. First, a dynamic model of supply chain with above uncertainties is developed. Then, a novel uncertainty-dependent robust inventory control method using inventory position information is proposed. Additionally, the maximum allowable vendor order placement lead time delay that ensures the stability of supply chains and the suppression of bullwhip effect under the proposed inventory control policy is explored and measured. We find that vendor order placement lead time delays do play important role in supply chain dynamics and contribute to its turbulence and volatility. The effectiveness and flexibility of proposed method is verified through simulation study. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

"We deal with long-term demand-driven capacity planning policies in the reverse channel of closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) with remanufacturing, under high capacity acquisition cost coupled with uncertainty in actual demand, sales patterns, quality and timing of end-of-use product returns. The objective is to facilitate the decision-making when the management faces the dilemma of implementing either a strategy of early large-scale investments to benefit from economies of scale and capacity readiness, or a flexible strategy of low volume but more frequent capacity expansions. We consider a CLSC with two sequential product-types. We study the system's response in terms of transient flows, actual/desired capacity level, capacity expansions/contractions and total supply chain profit, employing a simulation-based system dynamics optimization approach. Extensive numerical investigation covers a broad range of real-world remanufacturable products under alternative scenarios in relation to the market preference over product-types. The key findings propose flexible policies as improved alternatives to large-scale capacity expansions/contractions in terms of adaptability to the actual pattern of end-of-use product returns and involved risk in the investments' turnover. Flexible policies are also proposed as practices to avoid overcapacity phenomena in collection and remanufacturing capacity and as robust policies to product demand. Their implementation is revealed to be even more important for the case of remanufacturing, when a high capacity acquisition unit-cost ratio (remanufacturing/collection) is coupled with strong economies of scale. Finally, results under different information sharing structures show changes in remanufacturing policies, thus justifying the importance of coordination between the decision-maker and the distributor.

"Increasingly manufacturers implement lean practices to improve operational performance. In addition, manufacturers operate in ever more complex and volatile environments. This research investigates the effects of environmental complexity and dynamism on lean operations and lean purchasing practices. It empirically examines these relationships using archival and survey data from 126 manufacturers. The results show that environmental complexity positively moderates the effects of lean operations and lean purchasing on performance. However, environmental dynamism reduces the benefits of lean operations on performance, but enhances the benefits of lean purchasing on performance. Robustness tests further confirm the contingent effects of complexity and dynamism on lean operations and lean purchasing. This research offers a more nuanced understanding of the effect of external environmental context on lean practices, and suggests that practitioners should carefully consider the external environment when implementing different types of lean practices.

"The academic and practitioner literature offer numerous examples of firms that have achieved significant performance improvement as a result of implementing lean management. Lean firms consistently apply well-defined tools and the relationship between implementation of these tools and improved performance is well-established in the literature. Many lean practices, such as standardized work and visual cues, reduce variability, increase productivity, and make problems more visible which can create a culture where disruptions occur less often. Although there is evidence that lean implementation leads to reduced disruptions, a question that remains unresolved is why these lean management tools lead to fewer disruptions and whether conditions such as the level of complexity and inventory in the system predict the successful application of these lean practices. Because many of the firms that adopt lean management can be characterized as complex work systems, we draw insights from literature on complex organizations operating in environments that are inherently perilous. Two constructs that are addressed in this literature are fundamental to the concept of lean management - interactive complexity and tight coupling or organizational slack. We argue that theory that applies to complex organizations provides a lens for viewing how lean management firms avoid disruptions and conclude that the theoretical basis for lean management lies in understanding how to overcome the complexity inherent in these systems to achieve disruption-free performance.",Lean management as a countermeasure for Normal disruptions,Lean management *** Complex organizations *** Normal accident theory,operations management research,WOS:000320049000005,2013,,,,,,
"One of the important stages in supply chain management which regards all the activities from the purchasing of raw material to final delivery of the product is the supplier selection process. Since it is the first stage of the supply chain management, it is a critical process affecting the consecutive stages. It is simply desired to select the best supplier for a specific product. But since there are a lot of criteria and alternatives to be considered, numerous decision making models have been proposed to provide a solution to this problem. Within this study, an integrated approach including fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and a mixed integer linear programming model is developed to select the best supplier in a multi-item/multi-supplier environment. The importance value of each supplier with respect to each product is obtained via fuzzy TOPSIS in the first stage. Then in the second stage, these values are used as an input in the mathematical model which determines the suppliers and the quantities of products to be provided from the related suppliers. So as to validate the proposed methodology, an application is performed in air filter sector. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

"In today's uncertain and complex business environment, supply chain strategy is playing an important role in the success of a firm's product and market growth strategy. In this paper, we present a framework depicting interactions between supply chain strategy and design, product design and development, and market strategy. Using the framework we undertake case studies of SMEs to better understand the importance of an integrated product-market-supply chain strategy. We empirically examine what decisions were made for market-entry and product innovations with regard to supply chain design, how they were implemented, and what the implications were for the firms' product success. It is revealed that SMEs do not typically consider their supply chain strategy before product introduction, and consequently experience supply chain problems that are likely to be detrimental to the firms' growth potentials. The results also support the theoretical proposition that proactive and pre-emptive involvement of suppliers and supply chain strategy would lead to a more robust strategic direction for growth, and contribute to extending the literature on the role and impact of supply chain and suppliers in product and market-entry innovations, with a focus on SMEs.

"Early writings in economics describe the entrepreneur's role in terms of bearing the uncertainty inherent in new undertakings. Much of the research published in the pages of Production and Operations Management deals with management under uncertainty. The shared concerns over the impacts of multiple types of uncertainty suggest that research on Operations Management (OM) can play a role in the development of theory in entrepreneurship. We discuss aspects of such a role from two perspectives. First, we consider several topics in the OM literature that have clear applications or parallels in entrepreneurship. These topics include innovation, the management of technology, new product development, flexibility, and hedging strategies. Understanding these topical connections should aid in the development of tools and applications central to the practice of entrepreneurship. On another level, when we consider how the approaches to many of these topics in OM are grounded in theory adapted from Operations Research and Economics we argue that these same roots can be used as starting points for the development of theory in entrepreneurship. As examples, we will argue that the theoretical bases supporting robust optimization, stochastic dynamic programming, and even Total Quality Management can also serve as foundations of theories about the roles, practice, and behaviors of entrepreneurs.",Advancing Theory in Entrepreneurship from the Lens of Operations Management,entrepreneurship *** OM research,production and operations management,WOS:000327302200008,2013,,,,,,
"Drawing on transition theory, we conceptualize local food networks as innovations that initially function and develop in local niches within a given food regime. As niche-innovations local food networks induce socio-ecological changes on the local level and they have the potential to foster wider transformations of the dominant food regime. Many local food networks adopt the concept of food sovereignty as a kind of leitmotif. At the core of this concept lies the question of how to create an agro-food system that, (i) allows for democratic participation and civic engagement in food production, and (ii) sets up new relationships that avoid social inequity and the exploitation of both humans and nature. In this paper we shed light on how the Austrian local food network SpeiseLokal addresses the challenge of operationalizing the concept of food sovereignty. The case study captures the strategies which local food networks embark on and depicts the difficulties they encounter. The paper aims to identify critical points of intersection that either strengthen or constrain local food networks from becoming established, operating, and up-scaling in the ways they wish; that is, in accordance with the principles and aims of food sovereignty, while avoiding a later assimilation into the dominant food regime.",Do Local Food Networks Foster Socio-Ecological Transitions towards Food Sovereignty?

"The paradigm of the green economy has contributed to raising the attention paid to developing sustainability-oriented strategies for supply chain (SC) management. The responsibility of producers to extend and reverse SCs is a critical and timely topic that captures increasing concerns over the way firms can adapt their business models to interlinking technical, socio-economic and environmental frameworks. This is particularly true when producers are not also reuse/recycle actors. By performing a critical review of the scientific literature on this field, this article develops nine elemental factors that can be considered for assessing the impacts of collaborative strategies as a means to implement extended producer responsibility (EPR) in open-loop SCs. The resulting conceptual framework provides EPR implementation guidance under different market conditions. Inter-organizational relationships are found to present both opportunities and threats that can be profitably managed under a systemic perspective.

"Increased reliance on the Internet for critical infrastructure and the global nature of supply chains provides an opportunity for adversaries to leverage dependencies and gain access to vital infrastructure. Traditional approaches to assessing risk in the cyber domain, including estimation of impacts, fall short due to uncertainty in how interconnected systems react to cyber attack. This paper describes a method to represent the pathways of disruption propagation, evaluate the macroeconomic impact of cyber threats and aid in selecting among various cybersecurity policies. Based on state of the art agent-based modeling, multicriteria decision analysis, and macroeconomic modeling tools, this framework provides dynamic macroeconomic, demographic and fiscal insights regarding shocks caused by cyber attacks to the regional economy over time. The interlinkage of these models will provide a robust and adaptive system that allows policy makers to evaluate complex issues such as cybersecurity threats and their impacts on the geopolitical, social, environmental, and macroeconomic landscape. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).",Decision framework for evaluating the macroeconomic risks and policy impacts of cyber attacks,Agent-based modeling *** Critical infrastructure *** Cybersecurity *** Input/output modeling *** Macroeconomics *** Multicriteria decision analysis,environment systems and decisions,84889081510,2013,,,,,,

"Mountain regions and peripheral communities, which often depend on few economic sectors, are among the most exposed and sensitive to climate change. Governance of such socio-economic-ecological networks plays a strong role in determining their resilience. Social processes of governance, such as collaboration between communities, can be systematically assessed through the existence and strength of connections between actors and their embeddedness in the broader socio-economic network by social network analysis (SNA). This paper examines how network governance of the tourism industry-dependent Swiss Gotthard region relates to resilience to climate change by SNA. The paper argues that economic diversification and a network structure supporting stability, flexibility, and innovation increase regional resilience to climate change. The Gotthard network has a high diversification capability due to high cohesion and close collaboration, limited innovative capacity by the existence of only two subgroups, and considerable flexibility through the centralized structure. Main weaknesses are a low density, uneven distribution of power, and a lack of integration of some supply chain sectors into the overall network. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Network governance and regional resilience to climate change: Empirical evidence from mountain tourism communities in the Swiss Gotthard region,Adaptive capacity *** Mountain communities *** Regional environmental change *** Social network analysis *** Vulnerability,regional environmental change,84869190943,2012,,,,,,
"The importance of social responsibility of corporate and business units is increasingly emphasized by researchers and practitioners in recent years. Since supply chains play important roles in todays business environment, the issue of social responsibility should be considered carefully when designing and planning of supply chains to move towards sustainability. This paper addresses the problem of socially responsible supply chain network design under uncertain conditions. To this aim, first a bi-objective mathematical programming model is developed wherein its objective functions include minimizing the total cost and maximizing the supply chain social responsibility. Then, for coping with uncertain parameters effectively, a novel possibilistic programming approach, called robust possibilistic programming (RPP), is proposed. Several varieties of RPP models are developed and their differences, weaknesses, strengths and the most suitable conditions for being used are discussed. A real industrial case study is provided to illustrate the performance and applicability of the proposed RPP models in practice. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Robust possibilistic programming for socially responsible supply chain network design: A new approach,Corporate social responsibility *** Fuzzy mathematical programming *** Necessity measure *** Robust possibilistic programming *** Supply chain network design,fuzzy sets and systems,84864579681,2012,,,,,,
"It is critical to facilitate business partners to be seamlessly interoperable with each other as the network-centric manufacturing (NCM) paradigm becomes a major trend in today's manufacturing environment. In this work, we propose a semantic e-Kanban inventory system where a semantic gateway is acting as a mapping hub to enable heterogeneous messages to be seamlessly exchanged between business partners on demand. The semantic gateway uses reasoning rules to map business partners' proprietary data schemas and provides interoperability required for NCM. To observe the network dynamics of our proposed system, a discrete time dynamic model is built and shows its growth to a scale-free network with a convergence rate depending on the initial connectivity of the semantic gateway and preferential attachment parameters. To analyse the proposed system from an economic perspective, analytical and numerical studies are conducted showing that it has enough potential to reduce supply chain costs in comparison to those of the traditional approach. Finally, this study attempts to address the cost-sharing issue encountered when multiple partners are direct beneficiaries of the efficiency gain through a joint network-centric capability, but it is questionable who should pay for the capability implementation. The cost-sharing issue must be investigated because most network-centric capabilities would not be economically or technically feasible for an individual company to achieve. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","A semantic e-Kanban system for network-centric manufacturing: Technology, scale-free convergence, value and cost-sharing considerations",Cost sharing *** e-Kanban *** Information value *** Interoperability *** Network-centric manufacturing *** Preferential attachment *** RDF *** Semantic gateway *** Web service *** XML,international journal of production research,84867068766,2012,,,,,,
"Supplier selection has been a popular topic since the selection of the most appropriate supplier for cooperation is being increasingly important for the success of an enterprise. The problem is multi-criteria in nature, and a variety of multi-criteria decision making methodologies have been proposed. However, most of them did not take into account the interrelationships among the critical success factors and the fuzziness of the data involved in deciding the preferences of the factors. The objective of this research is to propose a fuzzy analytic network process model to evaluate various aspects of suppliers. With the consultation with the experts, the proposed model can consider the feedback and interdependency of factors in a network, and the factors are pairwise compared under an uncertain environment.

"Supply chain is a typical scenario of exploiting Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. Its growing use in all the supply chain areas makes the presence of many close RFID readers more common. In such environment, interferences among readers are critical. Many protocols have been proposed to reduce reader-to-reader collisions. Experimental data showed that the Neighbor Friendly Reader Anticollision (NFRA) protocol (IEEE Trans. Ind. Electron., vol. 56, no. 7, pp. 2326-2336, July 2009) maximizes the network throughput. However, it does not take into account the delay between the request and the granting of query tags, causing delays for some readers.

"This paper introduces a decision model and framework for subcontractor selection and team formation in the built environment based on the economic/business, social and environmental triple-bottom-line aspects of sustainability. The model and decision framework aid the decision maker in forming a construction project team that can most benefit the overall goal of sustainability and compatibility amongst the subcontractors (supply chain) from a number of trade industries. The model uses both the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Analytic Network Process (ANP) as its basis. Once the generic decision model is defined, an example application is described to show its use and feasibility. The robustness of the solution is demonstrated using sensitivity analysis, allowing the decision maker to appreciate the complexities in this decision environment.

"The global supplier network is becoming an increasingly important asset for many firms. If successfully managed, supplier relationships may support the firm's strategic orientation and become a sustainable advantage on the global market. A key question is thus how the firm can develop and maintain such relationships. The market-driving strategy has recently been advanced as a more pro-active type of market orientation that aims to reconfigure the supply chain, change the nature of competition and the values of the customers. We especially investigate how market-driving firms can develop their supplier relationships so that they actively support this strategy. We present a set of propositions that specify factors critical for the development of the market-driving firm's supplier relationships and develop a theoretical framework that specifies how these different factors interact in order to strengthen the market-driving orientation of a supplier relationship. The results are generated from an in-depth case study of IKEA's corporate supplier strategy and of supplier relationships in the Russian and Polish markets. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Market-driving strategy implementation through global supplier relationships,Competitive advantage *** Global strategy *** Market driving *** Supplier relationships,industrial marketing management,84866399491,2012,,,,,,
"The term ""system"" is defined as a: ""...set or arrangement of elements (people, products, (hardware, software) and processes (facilities, equipment, material, and procedures)) that are related and whose behavior satisfies customer/operational needs, and provides for the life cycle sustainment of the products"" [1]. Similarly, ""enterprise"" is described as a: ""goal-directed complex system of resources -human, information, financial, and physical-and activities, usually a significant operational scope, complication, risk, and duration"" [2], However, the necessities of today's market governed by intense competition, globalizations, and battles among supply chains, have changed the focus on how an enterprise conducts its business. Enterprises are gradually moving on from operating as a stand-alone entity to producing goods and services through a network of independent or semi-independent organizations [3]. As a result, enterprises are becoming extended network-based organisms able to operate in extremely complex environments [4]. In order to capture the dynamic nature of such entities, existing approaches can be combined to introduce an Extended Enterprise System (EES) as ""a complex network of distinctive yet distributed and interdependent organizational systems that are connected in an autonomic way to achieve objectives beyond reaching capacities of each"" [5]. The type of interactions among constituent systems of such a network might be defined based on hierarchy, collaboration, coordination, or a combinatorial form. Regardless of the interconnectivity rules and forms that results in an increased flexibility and adaptability, an EES is not devoid of being susceptible to sudden, unforeseen vulnerability that can put it in a position of great risk through astronomical financial losses and a steep decline in its overall market share, thereby leading to the loss in its competitive advantage. Since developing a ""risk free"" strategy that enables the ""ideal"" functioning of an EES is nearly impossible in the currently prevailing business environment, having a clear understanding of the critical risks associated with the functioning of an EES is absolutely necessary for its growth and sustenance in the business environment. Furthermore, the boundaries for evaluation and management of risks associated with an EES are inherited from a plethora of intra- as well as inter-organizational relationships [6,7] that stretches well beyond those associated with its enterprise-centric counterparts, and therefore warrants a great deal of attention from policy-makers as a part of designing a well-structured risk mitigation strategy. However, despite the rapidly growing popularity of EES among practitioners, there is still a considerable void in the open literature on evaluating the critical risks associated with an EES, something that the current research is trying to shed some light on. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",Evaluating risks associated with extended enterprise systems (EES), ,ieee aerospace and electronic systems magazine,84863486090,2012,,,,,,

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to report insights on supply chain issues in small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) based on an analysis of six case organizations. Design/methodology/approach: A broad range of qualitative and quantitative data was collected during interviews and field visits in a multi-case study research design. In total, six manufacturing SME units were investigated and analyzed. Findings: The deliverables ofthe paper are two-fold. First, the paper documents six cases uncovering supply chain and operations complexities in manufacturing SMEs. Second, based on the critical analysis of the case organizations, insights developed are reported with a set of recommendations. Practical implications: The field of supply chain management (SCM) is reaching a new stage. After a period dominated by enthusiasm for the newness of the idea of managing the stream of products across the whole chain, from supply through manufacturing to end-users, it is now realized that ""one size does not fit all"". SCM has been considered an effective strategy for integrating suppliers and customers with the objective of improving responsiveness and flexibility of manufacturing organizations. It seems that the supply chain issues are much explored in the context of large enterprises but less attention is paid to SMEs. Originality/value: This paper draws an attention towards select supply chain issues in Indian manufacturing SMEs. The paper includes six cases highlighting their supply chain issues in the Indian environment. Subsequently, an analysis is reported to acquaint industry practitioners and contemporary researchers with the issues that influence managing supply chain in SME sectors. It maps SCM orientation of case organizations and summarizes the critical supply chain issues in Indian manufacturing SMEs. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Supply chain issues in Indian manufacturing SMEs: Insights from six case studies,India *** Large enterprises *** Manufacturing industries *** Small to medium-sized enterprises *** Supply chain management,journal of manufacturing technology management,84861890762,2012,,,,,,
"With the world's population now in excess of 7 billion, it is vital to ensure the chemical and microbiological safety of our food, while maintaining the sustainability of its production, distribution and trade. Using UN databases, here we show that the international agro-food trade network (IFTN), with nodes and edges representing countries and import-export fluxes, respectively, has evolved into a highly heterogeneous, complex supply-chain network. Seven countries form the core of the IFTN, with high values of betweenness centrality and each trading with over 77% of all the countries in the world. Graph theoretical analysis and a dynamic food flux model show that the IFTN provides a vehicle suitable for the fast distribution of potential contaminants but unsuitable for tracing their origin. In particular, we show that high values of node betweenness and vulnerability correlate well with recorded large food poisoning outbreaks. © 2012 Ercsey-Ravasz et al.",Complexity of the international agro-food trade network and its impact on food safety, ,plos one,84861702402,2012,,,,,,
"The consideration of environmental issues has emerged as a topic of critical importance for today's globalized supply chains. The purpose of this paper is to develop a strategic-tactical decision support model to assist managers in evaluating the impact of environmental issues, related to transportation emissions, on the transport geography of a region. Specifically we provide a model that addresses: (i) supply chain network design, including port of entry and transportation mode, and (ii) decisions on using dedicated versus shared warehouses and transportation. The applicability of the proposed methodology is examined through the development of a sustainable supply chain network in the South-Eastern Europe region. The results indicate that in most cases using shared warehouses from Third Party Logistics operators improves both the cost and the environmental performance of a company. In all cases shared use of transportation operations minimizes the amount of CO 2 and PM emissions generated, while dedicated use minimizes costs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",The impact of greening on supply chain design and cost: A case for a developing region,Carbon footprint *** Supply chain design *** Supply chain sustainability,journal of transport geography,84856353666,2012,,,,,,
"Before the Gulf War, the population of Iraq enjoyed a relatively high level of water supply and sanitation services. The sector operated efficiently, utilizing then-current technologies. Since, the water supply and sanitation sector has experienced a steady but devastating decline. Aging infrastructure, poorly maintained equipment, leaking water and sewer networks, and low technical capacity and morale are some of the key problems of the sector. The lack of funding led to insufficient imports, lack of maintenance, and curtailment of needed expansion. These services were surpassed by other national priorities, which resulted in a serious degradation of the quality and extent of services delivered. Diseases associated with poor sanitation, unsafe water, and unhygienic practices had increased to alarming rates. For the purpose of this study, samples were collected from eight stations along the Tigris River. The major sources of data are the Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Water Resources. Various statistical techniques, for example, student's t-test, Kendall's test, trend test, ANOVA test, are used to determine the water quality of the Tigris River. The cities lying in the outskirts of Baghdad are found in poor condition in terms of water supply and sewerage. In central Baghdad, the water treatment plants are satisfying the standard conditions but the water supply network is in a poor condition. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Critical assessment of environmental quality of Baghdad, Iraq",Drinking water *** Iraq *** Rivers and streams *** Sewers *** Water pollution *** Water quality *** Water supply *** Water treatment plants,journal of environmental engineering (united states),84868549224,2012,,,,,,
"The knowledge-based bio-economy has gained prominence as a research and innovation policy of the European Union. As a policy framework the knowledge-based bio-economy has attracted two contending visions, which can be analyzed as imaginaries - strategic discourses prefiguring a possible, desirable future. In the dominant vision, life sciences will enhance productivity for European competitive advantage in global value chains. A rival vision links agroecology and shorter food supply chains, as a means for farmers to gain more from the value that they add. Each vision favors a different diagnosis of unsustainable agriculture and eco-efficient remedies. Each extends a different paradigm of agri-innovation, foreseeing an economic community that can gain from future markets. These two contending visions give different meanings to the same key terms - knowledge, biological resources and economy. In the EU's research program for a knowledge-based bio-economy, a life sciences vision dominates the priorities, though agroecology has also gained a significant place in response to proposals from stakeholder networks. Through these efforts, research policy priorities have been opened up to more plural agri-innovation pathways. © 2012 Copyright 2012 Institute of Local Government Studies, University of Birmingham.",EU agri-innovation policy: Two contending visions of the bio-economy,agri-innovation policy *** agroecology *** critical discourse analysis *** cultural political economy *** eco-efficiency *** European Technology Platforms (ETPs) *** Framework Programme 7 *** imaginaries *** knowledge-based bio-economy (KBBE) *** life sciences *** sustainable agriculture,critical policy studies,84860994420,2012,,,,,,
"Due to the IT advances, the logistics management faces a change to the new era. This article proposes a novel method to evaluate the real-time overall performance of a logistics network for a supply chain. The corresponding strategies to manage the underperformed channels can be subsequently obtained in the method. Thus, the logistics network can be managed timely under the stochastic environment, and it makes the SCM robust. The overall performance of the logistics network is integrated by the individual logistics channel real-time performance which can be easily obtained by the new IT technologies such as RFID, etc. The fuzzy-scorecard is introduced to indicate the measured key performance indicators (KPI) for the network. Some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the various scenarios of management for the proposed method. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"In this study, a general comprehensive model is proposed for strategic closed-loop supply chain network design under interval data uncertainty. The proposed model considers various assumptions such as multiple periods, multiple products, and multiple supply chain echelons as well as uncertain demand and purchasing cost. In addition, bill of materials for each product is considered via a new approach in management of forward and reverse flows of products for producing new products and reusing or disassembling returned products. Uncertainty of parameters in the proposed model is handled via an interval robust optimisation technique. The model assumptions are well matched with decision making environments of food and high-tech electronics manufacturing industries. The factors that make these two industries similar are time-dependent properties of products such as prices and warehousing lifetime period. The computational results of solving the proposed model via LINGO 8 demonstrate efficiency of the proposed model in dealing with uncertainty in an agile manufacturing context. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Robust closed-loop supply chain network design for perishable goods in agile manufacturing under uncertainty,bill of materials *** closed-loop supply chain network design *** interval data uncertainty *** product warehousing lifetime *** robust optimisation,international journal of production research,84865021292,2012,,,,,,
"This paper provides a risk modeling approach to facilitate the evaluation and the design of Supply Chain Networks (SCNs) operating under uncertainty. The usefulness of the approach is demonstrated with two realistic case studies. Three event types are defined to describe plausible future SCN environments: random, hazardous and deeply uncertain events. A three-phase hazard modeling approach is also proposed. It involves a characterization of SCN hazards in terms of multihazards, vulnerability sources and exposure levels; the estimation of incident arrival, intensity and duration processes; and the assessment of SCN hit consequences in terms of damage and time to recovery. Based on these descriptive models, a Monte Carlo approach is then proposed to generate plausible future scenarios. The two cases studied illustrate the key aspects of the approach, and how it can be used to obtain resilient SCNs under disruptions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"The interest in supply chain networks and their analysis as complex systems is rapidly growing. The physical approach to the topic draws on the concept of heterogenous interacting agents. The interaction among agents is considered as a repeated process of orders and production. The dynamics of production in the supply chain network which we observe is nonlinear due to the random failures in processes of orders and production. We introduce an agent-based model of a supply chain network which represents in more detail the real economic environment in which firms operate. We focus on the influence of local processes on the global economic behavior of the system and study how the proposed modifications change the general properties of the model. We observe collective bankruptcies of firms, which lead to self-emerging network structures. Our results give insight into the dynamics of default processes in supply chain networks, which have important implications both for risk managers and policy makers. Based on the simulations we show that agent-based modeling is a powerful tool for optimization of supply chain networks. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

"Purpose - Drawing on a network perspective on enterprise agility, the purpose of this paper is to explore whether firms with superior network structure not only may be better able to generate direct effect on firm performance, but whether a superior network structure may also help firms to create better firm agility and thus enhance their performance. Design/methodology/approach - The study employed a survey method and data were collected from 250 companies in Taiwan's glass industry. Using structural equation modeling (SEM) technology, it specified the measurement properties of survey instrument such as reliabilities and validities and then identified causal relation among latent constructs to examine causal effects of hypotheses testing. Findings - The results show that a firm's agility capability and its network structure are a,critical competitive strategy source of firm performance. Moreover, network structure also partially mediates the impact of enterprise agility on firm performance. Research limitations/implications - Because the data were collected from a single industry and firm performance is evaluated by subjective managerial assessments, further research may be necessary by using the data involving multiple industries with objective performance indices for more meaningful and generalized results. Practical implications - The findings confirm the importance of enterprise agility for contemporary firms in today's dynamic business environment. By reinforcing enterprise agility, firms could react better to unpredictable changes. In addition, firms also are suggested to put more effort into developing and maintaining their network structures, both as repositories of external resources and as boosters of enterprise agility.

"Risk is inherent in most economic activities. This is especially true of production activities where results of decisions made today may have many possible different outcomes depending on future events. Since companies cannot usually protect themselves completely against risk, they have to manage it. In this paper, we present a multi-objective model to deal with a multi-period multi-product multi-site aggregate production planning problem for a medium-term planning horizon under uncertainty. The first objective function attempts to minimize sum of the expected value and the variability of total costs with reference to inventory levels, regular, overtime and subcontracting levels, backordering levels, and labor, machine and warehouse capacities. The second objective function highlighted the concept of customer service level through minimizing the expected value of maximum shortages among all customers' zones from which the variability of that is conducted. The last objective function aims to maximize workers productivity, a weighted average of productivity levels in all factories and in all periods which is weighted by the number of k-level labors. Then, we use an efficient algorithm that is a combination of an augmented e-constraint method and genetic algorithm to solve our proposed model. The results demonstrate the practicability of the proposed multi-objective stochastic model as well as the proposed algorithm.",An efficient algorithm to solve a multi-objective robust aggregate production planning in an uncertain environment,Aggregate production planning *** Stochastic optimization *** Augmented epsilon-constraint *** Genetic algorithm *** Multi-objective optimization *** Supply chain management,international journal of advanced manufacturing technology,WOS:000300090100030,2012,,,,,,
"With an increasing number of disasters disrupting commerce and community life around the world, it is timely to position humanitarian and disaster relief supply chains (HDRSC) within the broad field of supply chain management. This article presents a framework to that end. It distinguishes attributes of the environment that illustrate the difficulties encountered in supply chain management. Although considerable research has been conducted in logistics issues affecting HDRSCs, very little management research speaks to the complicating attributes. Thus, this article describes activities such as demand determination, supply chain coordination, recognizing when to move along the life cycle and post-disaster reconstruction that differentiates supply chain concerns from logistics concerns. From this backdrop, some of the areas where research into HDRSCs can inform supply chain management in general are presented. The article concludes by discussing critical areas of research need as identified by experienced practitioners.

"The European Union set the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directive in 2003 to ban the import of electronic products that contain hazardous substances. To survive, electrical and electronics manufacturers have had to develop strategies to meet these requirements as well as search for new management methods that are feasible and have low risk. A number of studies have pointed out that a large portion of a new product's environmental quality (e. g. in compliance with RoHS) is determined at the beginning of the product development stage. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose, from a systematic point of view, several critical control processes applicable to the product development stage. Backcasting is applied for the process development. An internationally recognised quality management system, IECQ QC080000 HSPM, is referred to at the baseline step to help analyse a sustainability gap analysis of major flows. Unified Modeling Language sequence diagrams are further adopted to describe and specify the details of these processes. At the end, potential applications and possible extensive research projects are discussed.

"Configuring a supply chain for a new product is a challenging task due to the lack of historical demand data and the dynamic/uncertain nature of the new product diffusion process. An integrated supply chain configuration (SCC) and new product diffusion (NPD) model is developed to explicitly account for the impact of demand dynamics during a new product's diffusion on an optimal supply chain configuration. Our hybrid NPD-SCC model allows a manufacturer to source from multiple suppliers, vendors or modes for its supply chain entities. Such a multiple-sourcing approach not only helps the manufacturer to diversify its pool of suppliers and maintain bargaining power, but also builds redundancy into the supply chain to hedge against potential demand surge and supply disruption during the new product life cycle. Through a case study and a comprehensive computational study, we find that although the single-sourcing solution is able to achieve lower unit-manufacturing cost (UMC), the multiple-sourcing approach is superior to single-sourcing on the overall supply chain performance in the environment with random supply disruptions. By building-in redundancy as multiple suppliers and modes, the resultant supply chain has less chance of being disrupted and achieves higher overall profit on average. We also draw several other managerial insights closing the gap between some supply chain operations and marketing strategies.",A hybrid optimisation approach to configure a supply chain for new product diffusion: a case study of multiple-sourcing strategy,supply chain design *** production planning *** new product diffusion *** sourcing *** supplier selection *** supply risks *** mathematical programming,international journal of production research,WOS:000305561600021,2012,,,,,,
"Purpose - The nascent behavioral supply management (BSM) research stream has raised the level of attention given to deviations from the standard assumptions of the rational paradigm in economics. The adaptation of cognitive heuristics, which add vulnerability to judgment and decision making, creates a pressing need to identify and develop mitigation strategies to debias decision making in the supply chain management environment. The purpose of this paper is to investigate debiasing measures, corresponding contextual variables in the supplier selection process, and their implications for financial decision effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach - The authors used a large-scale empirical survey among 306 buyers to investigate the relationships among individual and organizational contextual factors, debiasing measures in the supplier selection decision, and the financial effectiveness of the supplier selection decision. Findings - It was found that organizational and individual contextual factors have differing effects on the use of debiasing approaches in the supplier selection decision. Further, the debiasing tactics can have a positive (111 the case of supplier selection task decomposing) or a negative the case of an interactional challenging of the supplier selection) impact on the financial effectiveness of the supplier selection decision. These findings suggest that supply managers must better understand the contextual factors that influence the supplier selection decision, and carefully choose the correct debiasing tactics when selecting suppliers. Originality/value - This paper relaxes the economic assumption of rational actors and addresses the need to identify and use debiasing tactics in supply chain management contexts. The research also complements the broader-based behavioral decision-making literature, which has often relied upon experimental methodologies that use undergraduate or MBA students, by employing a survey-based approach with supply managers as key informants.",The impact of individual debiasing efforts on financial decision effectiveness in the supplier selection process,Supply chain management *** Buyers *** Decision making *** Supplier evaluation *** Behavioral supply management *** Debiasing strategies *** Supplier selection *** Decision effectiveness *** Structural equation modelling,international journal of physical distribution & logistics management,WOS:000314561900002,2012,,,,,,

"Applying agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) methodology, this paper analyzes the impact of alternative production-sales policies on the diffusion of a new generic product and the generated NPV of profit. The key features of the ABMS model, that captures the marketplace as a complex adaptive system, are: (i) supply chain capacity is constrained; (ii) consumers' new product adoption decisions are influenced by marketing activities as well as positive and negative word-of-mouth (WOM) between consumers; (iii) interactions among consumers taking place in the context of their social network are captured at the individual level; and (iv) the new product adoption process is adaptive. Conducting over 1 million simulation experiments, we determined the best production-sales policies under various parameter combinations based on the NPV of profit generated over the diffusion process. The key findings are as follows: (1) on average, the build-up policy with delayed marketing is the preferred policy in the case of only positive WOM as well as the case of positive and negative WOM. This policy provides the highest expected NPV of profit on average and it also performs very smoothly with respect to changes in build-up periods. (2) It is critical to consider the significant impact of negative word-of-mouth in choosing production-sales policies. Neglecting the effect of negative word-of-mouth can lead to poor policy recommendations, incorrect conclusions concerning the impact of operational parameters on the policy choice, and suboptimal choice of build-up periods.

"It is difficult to clearly estimate CO2 emissions because CO2 is emitted from various sources according to changing environments. Any approach relating to CO2 disposal has to deal with the presence of such uncertainty in CO2 disposal demand. A two-stage stochastic programming model is developed for planning CO2 emissions disposal networks by taking into account this uncertainty. The proposed CO2 disposal network model allows us to determine where and how much captured CO2 can be held for storage, and where to sequester the given amount of CO2 among multiple potential candidates for the purpose of minimizing the total cost of handling in the face of uncertainty in CO2 sequestration demand. The proposed model is applied to a case study that examines the robustness of the model in terms of handling changing environments in the context of CO2 emissions and disposal targets in Korea. The results gained aid in determining policy to plan the budget for the disposal of CO2.",Developing a Two-Stage Stochastic Programming Model for CO2 Disposal Planning under Uncertainty, ,industrial & engineering chemistry research,WOS:000300854800020,2012,,,,,,
"Electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) materials possess considerable economic value. together with potential toxicity. The rapidly increasing sales of EEE worldwide, constitutes the rational management of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) a matter of critical importance, both in economic and environmental terms. Taking into account that reverse logistics is one of the most important parameters in the management of waste equipment, it is particularly important for the manufacturers to control relevant cost in order to be market competitive. One of the most critical decisions regarding reverse logistics costs is the type of carrier to be used. To this end, this paper presents a multicriteria optimisation model for multi-type carriers of WEEE, based on multiple objective linear programming (MOLP). The main goal of a MOLP model is the weighted optimisation of different objectives. In our case. the proposed MOLP approach minimises total logistics costs, consumption of fossil fuel and production of emissions due to transportation of WEEE with the use of different types of containers. The model embodies existing infrastructure in collection points and recycling facilities and targets towards optimisation of the reverse logistics network for a single planning period by taking into account both economic and environmental aspects of the problem under study.

Under the context of environmental policy, the relationship between policy instruments ('command and control', market-based, and self-regulated) and the decisions of managers to adopt green supply chain management (G-SCM) practices is examined. The results show that in some cases the environmental legislation, market-based instruments and self-regulated incentives could play a critical role in the decisions of managers to adopt some specific G-SCM practices, while in other cases environmental policy instruments have not seemed to affect the decisions of managers regarding some other G-SCM practices.",The influence of environmental policy on the decisions of managers to adopt G-SCM practices,Corporate sustainability *** Environmental management *** Proactive environmental practices,clean technologies and environmental policy,WOS:000309473600019,2012,,,,,,
"In several manufacturing organizations. environmental management systems are often operationalized through a series of green projects that can lead to a reduction of waste or a more efficient use of the resources. In turn, these types of green projects contribute directly to the bottom line. Using detailed reports of 79 environmental projects that took place in manufacturing organizations in the Province of Quebec over the last decade; this paper examines the influence of four project characteristics on the project's financial outcome. The results suggest that projects related to the main product or its underlying production process (as opposed to peripheral projects) can be financially more beneficial despite their disruptive nature. Evidence was also found that green projects involving changes in the management systems are more profitable than the ones that entail a structural transformation. Finally, a positive linkage between organizational size and project's financial performance has been supported, as larger organizations have more capabilities to implement such green initiatives.

"The water industry is capital intensive and dependent on complex supply networks in the delivery of service characteristics, making procurement a critical activity. This paper rejects 'the lowest bid' form of procurement of the past and advocates the total cost and strategic relationship management procurement of the future. The authors develop arguments for more effective procurement leading to real cost reduction and service enhancement on a sustainable basis. This requires a range of strategic activities from the approach to the acquisition of major capital goods and associated services through to the management of relationships with contractors, suppliers and supply chains. The paper considers the differing procurement practices in Europe, Australia and the USA, and how, in comparison, equivalent practices result in higher costs in the UK than elsewhere. From this they propose a model for best practice procurement in the utilities industries and a step-by-step set of actions for improving performance. The proposed model begins with a strategic appraisal of procurement activity across an organisation focusing on overall objectives and desired outcomes leading to an effective operating model including the end-to-end management of the supply chain and the policy, resources and enabling technology required for successful delivery.",A model to manage the water industry supply chain effectively,Contracts &amp; Law *** Procurement *** Water supply,"proceedings of institution of civil engineers: management, procurement and law",84871099679,2012,,,,,,

"High turbulences and fluctuations of today's competitive business environments have put organisations under pressure to move toward efficient competitive strategy and seek competent approach to design their supply chain network under uncertainty. At the same line, this paper presents an efficient mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that is able to consider the key characteristics of agile supply chain, which is the best competitive strategy for high turbulent environments, such as direct shipments, outsourcing, different transportation modes, discount, alliance (process and information integration) between opened facilities and maximum waiting time of customers for deliveries. Additionally, the robust stochastic programming approach is applied to handle both operational and disruption risks of the agile supply chain network. Computational results show that the robust model is capable to result efficient solutions under scenario realisations with low cost variability contrary to deterministic model.

"Consider a supplier who is concerned with choosing a contract offered to the retailer. In addition to a wholesale price, the supplier looks for additional contract levers to improve performance. The three commonly used levers are inventory buyback, fixed payment and revenue sharing. This paper shows that the effectiveness of each of these contracts depends critically on the presence of three characteristics that define the complexity of the operating environment: demand uncertainty, demand price-sensitivity and information asymmetry. When the complexity is only about demand uncertainty, it is known that any of the three contracts can be utilised effectively by the supplier to extract all the first-best channel profit. When price-sensitivity of demand is added to the complexity, both revenue sharing and fixed payment remain perfectly effective. Inventory buyback, however, becomes a useless contract lever. We show that when the system is further complicated with information asymmetry, revenue sharing continues to be (almost) perfectly effective and inventory return stays to be useless. On the other hand, fixed payment proves to be useful, allowing the supplier to improve performance, but not to the degree of achieving first-best channel profit. © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Contract efficiency: Demand uncertainty, price sensitivity and information asymmetry",Contracting *** Endogenous pricing *** Game theory *** Supply chain management,international journal of operational research,84867468140,2012,,,,,,
"Copyright © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd. Over the past decade, the concepts of supply chain risk and supply chain risk management (SCRM) have grown in importance. These concepts have become prerequisite to the development of sustainable supply chain. Managing risks effectively in today’s complicated and long supply networks requires well focused efforts as disruption in the supply chain needs to be avoided or at least mitigated. Risk distribution is a risk management strategy which has been used to manage risks in other fields such as finance and law. However, a review of the supply chain literature observed that there is a lack of references related to risk distribution strategy in supply chains. This paper therefore tries to address this significant gap by defining the risk distribution concept, and by positioning risk distribution as part of supply chain strategy. A description of the risk distribution concept in other academic fields as well as an understanding of its characteristics derived from the literature is presented. These characteristics form the main elements of risk distribution that can be applied to supply chain management and enable the supply chain to become more sustainable.",Conceptualising risk distribution for supply chain sustainability,Literature review *** Risk *** Risk distribution *** Risk management strategy *** SCRM *** Supply chain *** Supply chain risk management,international journal of agile systems and management,85032862961,2012,,,,,,
"Biofuels supply chain comprises a wide set of activities involving a rather complex set of parameters. Cultivation of the raw materials is closely related to the agricultural sector whereas the production of the final product presumes the operation of a conversion plant. The distribution network aims at delivering the final product close to the consumption. The extent of the involvement of each one of the previously mentioned sectors is the result of strategic and operational planning of the whole supply chain and, in the general case, determines the efficiency of the biofuels sector. Taking also into account the very rapidly changing opinions related to the environmental behaviour of the whole biofuels supply chain, it becomes very clear that the parameters in the sector are continuously changing. Therefore, the consideration of an integrated supply chain appropriately modelled is believed to be very critical and could result in the optimal solution per case, economically and/or environmentally speaking. In this paper the development of a mathematical model for the optimal design and operation of Biofuels Supply Chain is proposed as an integrated approach that can take into account both technical and economic parameters affecting the performance of the whole value chain. Model implementation would facilitate and support the decision taking in various planning and operational issues such as infrastructure investments, the quantities of raw materials to be cultivated, the quantities of biofuels to be produced in the domestic market or imported, identifying the best available solution for the optimal design and operation of the biofuels supply chain. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Development and implementation of an optimisation model for biofuels supply chain,Biodiesel conversion *** Integrated biofuels planning *** Transportation fuels,energy,80053448022,2011,,,,,,
"This study attempts to determine the extent to which the South African consumers' needs and demands for beef have changed, as well as to identify opportunities and to assess whether the beef value chain is positioned to meet these changes in a bid to improve the delivery of customer value. Consumer, supply chain and network analyses are critical to finding an optimal solution that is sustainable enough to meet the changing environment. Industry-specific information regarding the structure and function of the beef value chain was gathered through interviews with industry leaders and experts; and specific consumer information was gathered through a consumer survey. The South African beef industry, like many other South African supply chains, is challenged by the increasing complexity and demand brought about by globalisation, increased volumes and competition, the shortage of skilled staff and pressures to meet changing customer needs. Consequently, the power has shifted from the supply side to the consumer. Although the industry has a good reputation, good management practices can further increase consumer confidence in beef. © Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.",A consumer-orientated study of the South African beef supply chain,beef value chain *** consumers *** South Africa,agrekon,79958721642,2011,,,,,,
"The concern about significant changes in the business environment (such as customer demands and transportation costs) has spurred an interest in designing scalable and robust supply chains. This paper proposes a robust optimization model for handling the inherent uncertainty of input data in a closed-loop supply chain network design problem. First, a deterministic mixed-integer linear programming model is developed for designing a closed-loop supply chain network. Then, the robust counterpart of the proposed mixed-integer linear programming model is presented by using the recent extensions in robust optimization theory. Finally, to assess the robustness of the solutions obtained by the novel robust optimization model, they are compared to those generated by the deterministic mixed-integer linear programming model in a number of realizations under different test problems. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",A robust optimization approach to closed-loop supply chain network design under uncertainty,Closed-loop supply chain network *** Reverse logistics *** Robust optimization,applied mathematical modelling,77956182227,2011,,,,,,
"In this work, we propose a single period stochastic inventory decision-making model that captures the trade-off between inventory policies and disruption risks for unreliable (both uncapacitated and capacitated) dual-sourcing reverse supply chain networks. Risk-management has emerged high at the corporate agenda as globalised supply chain networks are more stretched than ever due to offshoring and thus are more exposed to disruptions, while reverse logistics has been proven to constitute a profit center. In this environment, global companies have to scrutinize especially the role of major Asian economies (with large manufacturing capacities and huge markets), while conducting their strategic procurement planning. The developed model can be applied to a number of different scenario types encompassing various instances of disruptions to the collection of the end-of-life products, of the transportation system, and of the remanufacturing yield and capacity. Analytical closed-form solutions are obtained and important managerial insights on the merit of contingency strategies in managing uncertainties for reverse logistics networks are discussed. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Co. & Operational Research Society of Singapore.",Optimal sourcing decisions for unreliable reverse supply chains,inventory policies *** Reverse logistics *** sourcing decisions *** stochastic modeling *** supply chain disruptions *** supply chain management,asia-pacific journal of operational research,79952051163,2011,,,,,,
"Rapid changes and complexities in business environments have stressed the importance of interactions between partners and competitors, leading supply chains to become the most important element of contemporary business environments. There is a concomitant need for foresight in describing supply chain performance in all operating environments, including those involving punctuated disruptions. Furthermore, the urban metropolis is now widely recognized to be an environment which is especially vulnerable to supply chain disruptions and for which integrated supply chain decisions can produce very substantial net benefits. Accordingly, this paper presents a dynamic supply chain network model formulated as a differential variational inequality; the model is fashioned to allow consideration of supply chain disruption threats to producers, freight carriers, and retail enterprises. The DVI is solved using a fixed-point algorithm, and a simple numerical example, introduced to illustrate how the impacts of supply chain disruptions may be quantified, is presented. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Competition and disruption in a dynamic urban supply chain,City logistics *** Differential variational inequalities *** Disruptions *** Dynamic supply chains *** Supply chain networks *** Urban supply chains,transportation research part b: methodological,80051951647,2011,,,,,,
"Despite the potential benefits the Internet and other related technologies offer, current supply chain management techniques do not take full advantage of these benefits. E-business environments provide a facilitating infrastructure for solving the issues concerning the traditional supply chain, such as the scalability and flexibility for the efficient collaboration between partners. Both internal and external uncertainties to the supply chain can hinder collaboration between partners, and thus also hinder their ability to achieve their best possible performance. This research proposes using agent-based web services to better support collaboration within a supply chain. An advantage of agent-based web services is that they combine the strengths of both web services and multi-agents. Two different collaboration situations are used in order to demonstrate the flexibility of the system. Scalability is demonstrated when the supply chain faces changes in the partnership candidates. Simulation methods are used in order to validate the feasibility of this approach, and statistical tests reveal the robustness of the experimental results across diverse uncertainties. © 2012 Sharif University of Technology.

"Copyright © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd. Supply chain is a network of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers that act together to control, manage, and improve the overall supply chain performance. The most important and critical part of decision making is identifying the different sides of supply chain's performance. Evaluating the performance of the whole supply chain is a complex task, due to the complexity inherent in the structure and operations of the supply chain. This study presents a suggestion for a comprehensive system to evaluate the performance of the supply chain in eight dimensions (i.e., financial, customer, internal operations, learning and growth, people, environmental, and political perspectives). The proposed performance evaluation system (PES) suggests a procedural framework to explain the application methodology of that PES. Moreover, the study offers a simulation modelling methodology for modelling the complex system of supply chain.

"Competitive pressure forces companies to exert themselves in order to survive and to grow. When competition is intense, only excellent companies are positioned to survive. Competitive excellence derives from managerial excellence which has turned to the creation of world-class supply chain operations, along with its philosophies, approaches, tools and technologies to assure excellence. Even though talk of protectionism has surfaced with the strains of the downturn in the world economy, globalisation has changed the fabric of competition in the market and has imposed new and more exacting requirements on companies and their supply chains. In the global market, a company must achieve excellence on five critical competitive requirements, namely on quality, cost, flexibility, innovation and customer service, creating a compelling paradigm by which supply chain operations will be judged. This paper explores how companies can pursue competitive excellence in their supply chain, and thereby gain a global mindset, rapid response time and sustainable competitive performance. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Competitive excellence in the global supply chain,global business *** global networks *** supply chain management,"international journal of services, economics and management",84952964967,2011,,,,,,
"The advances in information technology have prompted the development of many supply chain information-sharing strategies, including electronic point of sales (EPOS), vendor-managed inventory (VMI), e-shopping, emergency transshipments, and so on. However, variations in the business environment can produce uncertainty and increase decision-making complexity for enterprises selecting from various supply chain information-sharing strategies. An effective and efficient supply chain strategy should be capable of reducing costs and raising customer-service levels, and should be capable of enhancing the robustness of the supply chain. In this study, the robustness of different supply chain strategies under various uncertain environments is studied using the simulated beer game. Techniques included Taguchi methodology and multiple criteria decision-making methods (MCDMs), including simple multiple attribute rating technology (SMART), technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), and grey relational analysis (GRA). The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio for each criterion is calculated to indicate the robustness of performance. This S/N ratio is used to determine an overall evaluation among various supply chain information-sharing strategies. The simulation results show that e-shopping has the most robust performance in uncertain environments. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"Purpose: The European Union (EU) energy supply environment is changing significantly and in a dynamic way, establishing the issue of safe energy imports as main priority. Greece relies heavily on energy imports. Furthermore, Greece aims to be elevated into an energy cross road for the energy supply to the EU. In this respect, the aim of this paper is the investigation of the suitability of graph theory concepts on energy supply networks and its application to represent energy corridors to Greece. Design/methodology/approach: Supporting frameworks to represent and assess the vulnerability of the corridors satisfying the Greek demand in oil and gas are considered a crucial issue and are presented in this paper, based on the graph theory approach. In addition, a pilot application of the shortest path algorithm and the maximum flow at minimum risk algorithm for the oil and gas corridors to Greece is presented and discussed. Findings: This paper introduces the application of graph theory to energy policy analysis. Indeed, the pilot application in oil and gas supply corridors to Greece, although quite simplified, has indicated the applicability of graph theory concepts in such problems and is considered a step forward of the existing studies, supporting the design efforts towards the development of a more reliable energy supply system. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, graph theory's application to energy corridors is not available in the international literature. In this respect, the added value of the paper is the provision of a sufficient decision support framework for the representation and assessment of the energy corridors' risk of energy availability, through the application of graph theory. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Graph theory-based approach for energy corridors network to Greece,Energy industry *** Graph theory *** Greece,international journal of energy sector management,79955685392,2011,,,,,,
"In this study, we extend the existing approaches to Supply Chain (SC) design based on the assessment of a SC's potential ability to adapt structurally in an agile environment. We determine a new metric, 'SC adaptation potential', and propose a method for its assessment based on the system entropy. This makes it possible to integrate the analysis of SC structure complexity and adaptability. Consequently, we consider the usage of adaptation potential for SC structuring. The adaptation potential can be used as an additional indicator to select a SC configuration. The analysis of adaptation potential makes it possible to take the decisions on the determination of a number of elements in a SC, their variety, and the interrelations between them with regard to the potential ability SC to adapt SC structurally in order to ensure flexibility and resilience.

"Globalisation presents business organisations with some special challenges that they have never met before; they have to manage their activities in the ambit of global supply chain networks. Traditional managerial approaches, techniques and principles are no longer effective in dealing with these challenges. This article examines logistics and inventory problems in a supply chain operating in two countries where decisions have to be made with uncertain customer information. There are some differentials between two countries in terms of vehicle operation cost and capacity, labour cost, warehousing cost, etc. This article proposes three different types of robust models to integrate logistics and inventory processes between the two counties for coping with uncertain customer shipment information and the risk it entails. The first model is called the robust optimisation model with solution robustness, which provides an integrated logistics and inventory solution that is less sensitive to realisations of stochastic parameters. The second type of model is called the robust optimisation model with model robustness allowing late delivery (if it is profitable). The third type of model is called the robust optimisation model with trade-off between solution robustness and model robustness. It provides a direct way to measure the trade-off between risk and cost during the international transportation process. A series of experiments demonstrate that the proposed robust models can provide effective integrated logistics and inventory systems between two countries, which is important in today's highly competitive and dynamic business environment. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",Linear robust models for international logistics and inventory problems under uncertainty,global supply chain *** international logistics *** inventory *** road transport *** robust optimisation,international journal of computer integrated manufacturing,79953003182,2011,,,,,,
"Purpose: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been identified as one of Unilever's priority environmental impact themes: this assessment was therefore conducted to help the Knorr brand measure and understand the GHG emissions related to its product portfolio, identify opportunities to manage GHG emissions in the Unilever-owned operations (manufacture) and influence managed reductions elsewhere in the Knorr product lifecycles, and assess the impact of the brand's innovation and portfolio strategies on its GHG footprint. Methods: A bottom-up product-based life cycle assessment (LCA) approach was considered impractical to assess Knorr's portfolio's complexity. Thus, a meta-product-based accounting LCA approach was followed (Milà i Canals et al. 2009). Up to 16 product types or ""meta-products"" were assessed in each geographical region, with a total of 36 meta-products assessed globally. Then, the Knorr GHG footprint was derived by multiplying the impacts calculated per tonne of each product type with the sales volumes in 2007. Data for ingredients and processing technologies were gathered from the literature and suppliers; data from Knorr factories were used for the manufacturing stage. The variability in ingredients' production and processing and in manufacture was factored in and propagated through the calculations to assess the robustness of the results. Results: The profiles of different meta-products within a product group (e.g. dry soups) follow similar patterns in terms of absolute GHG per tonne and distribution of such emissions along the life cycle. Variations are observed due to recipe composition and electricity mixes in the different regions. The range of variability around absolute results is significant and varies between meta-products. Aggregating the results for individual meta-products with their production volumes, the global Knorr brand GHG footprint in 2007 was estimated to be in the region of 3-5 million tonnes CO2e/annum (95% confidence interval). In spite of the significant variability ranges found, the results are useful for target setting and identification of opportunities for improvement. Conclusions: This is the world's first life cycle GHG assessment at brand's product portfolio level. The meta-product approach simultaneously allows for the assessment and comparison of individual product types as well as for the estimation of a brand's total GHG. The variability assessment enhanced robustness of the results by identifying a confidence range; given the complexity of the studied supply chains and the current data quality translated in wide confidence ranges, single number on-pack carbon labels seem questionable and not robust enough to inform consumers. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Estimating the greenhouse gas footprint of Knorr,Bouillons *** Greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint *** Knorr *** Meta-product *** Soups,international journal of life cycle assessment,79951683408,2011,,,,,,
"Purchasing order methods and inventory control are vital elements in fulfilling customer orders and building internal performance; this is particularly the case in retailing operations. In this manuscript, we develop different scenarios for various order methods for a wood retailer, where the performance of the different methods is evaluated through simulation, whereupon the fit between environments and methods is compared. Our results indicate that only simple environments follow analytical cost and service level calculations, while increasing complexity increases the synchronisation need between forecasts and reordering methods. In our research we also compare different ordering methods, and find that while the reorder point method is the most robust solution from the retailer's perspective, it could lead to distortion within entire wood supply chain.

"Expandable cavity sealers have become a critical component of the overall acoustic package that contributes to the documented noise reduction in passenger car applications over the course of the last twenty years. They encompass a variety of technologies, some of which are delivered into the supply chain as bulk materials and others which are highly engineered parts and assemblies. As the market for smaller and more fuel efficient vehicles continues to expand, design architectures of the base vehicle platforms are evolving to include body designs with smaller spaces between adjacent layers of sheet metal. As this space, or cavity, between the adjacent layers of sheet metal is shrinking, the complexity of components that must be integrated into the space between these layers of steel is increasing. Complex arrays of airbags, corresponding wire harnesses, and water management tools are now standard requirements in the design process. To manage the complexity of these lightweight and fuel efficient vehicle architectures, new engineering design solutions are required to meet stringent acoustic requirements. The supply base of acoustic products to the automotive OEMs has also matured over this time period, creating a very competitive environment, both regionally and globally. Design solutions that go beyond the basic functionality of a cavity filler are becoming more common. This paper will evaluate a recent design challenge presented by an OEM to improve visibility for the driver. Here, the hardware to direct water drainage is moved from outside the windshield pillar cavity body metal to inside the cavity metal. A new cavity filler solution is conceptualized to manage this unique packaging and acoustic performance need. Although it's in its infancy, the solution, along with other means of water management, are measured for Insertion Loss and compared. This initial study supports the promise for acoustic performance of a solution that does not exist in the market today.

"Various disasters with serious results are reported and happen around our lives. Most of them are unconventional contingency events. Emergency relief is an important activity dealing with the disasters to transfer a large number of materials to the destroyed places for casualties and reconstruction for the country, even the world.

It is critical to schedule the multimodal transportation flow of the chain with time efficiency of higher reliability. In this study, the system of container multimodal transportation emergency relief is modeled as an affinity network inspired by the immune system. An integer linear programming model is proposed to build the path selection for container supply chain in the context of emergency relief. The simulation study shows the promising effects of the model.

"Flooding can have severe impacts on the water supply services and adaptation responses for the provision of high-quality water supplies are necessary to cope with the risks exacerbated by climate change. This paper explores the planning process for adaptation strategies, emphasizing current research and modelling constraints and comparing resilience strategies. The flood hazard, vulnerability and impact were assessed based on information provided by the Environment Agency, local knowledge and network modelling of outages. Improvements in flood estimation were suggested to extend the range of scenarios analysed and the geographic cover and scope of models, whilst reducing and quantifying associated uncertainty. For evaluating consequences of widespread flooding, information on joint flood probabilities would be relevant, particularly where sites are interconnected. Considering the uncertainties in the approach, two strategies were explored to manage the flood risk, i.e. enhanced asset and system resilience. Low-regret options designed to protect a site from flooding were chosen and, where the population at risk is high, those were complemented with long term strategies for increased robustness of supply network to a multiplicity of risks. © 2011 IWA Publishing.",Practical Paper Alleviating the flood risk of critical water supply sites: Asset and system resilience,Adaptation *** Asset management *** Flood mitigation *** Flood risk *** Resilience *** Water supply network,journal of water supply: research and technology - aqua,79251476887,2011,,,,,,
"The purpose of this paper is to aid just-in-time (JIT) manufacturers in selecting the most appropriate suppliers and in evaluating supplier performance. Many manufacturers employ the JIT philosophy in order to be more competitive in today's global market. The success of JIT on the production floor has led many firms to expand the JIT philosophy to the entire supply chain. The procurement of parts and materials is a very important issue in the successful and effective implementation of JIT; thus, supplier selection and performance evaluation in long-term relationships have became more critical in JIT production environments. The proposed systems can assist manufacturers in handling these issues. In this research, neural network based supplier selection and supplier performance evaluation systems are presented. The proposed approach is not limited to JIT supply. It can assist manufacturers in selecting the most appropriate suppliers and in evaluating supplier performance. The proposed neural network based systems are tested with data taken from an automotive factory, and the results show that the proposed systems can be used effectively. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"Providing food, energy and materials for the rising global population is a challenge which is compounded by increased pressure on natural resources such as land, water and fossil sources of raw materials. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human activities have increased with industrial development and population expansion, and it is anticipated that resulting climate change might further limit agricultural productivity, through changes to weather patterns and global availability/distribution of agriculturally productive land. Growing crops as feedstocks for industrial uses is seen as one way of reducing GHG emissions and dependency on fossil resources. However, determining the extent to which the development of crops for industrial use will effect GHG balances and provide for a more energy efficient manufacturing system requires the development and use of appropriate calculation methodologies.Research at the Porter Institute has identified over 250 different scenarios for bioenergy production systems using commodity crops. In order to rationalise this complexity and diversity, a modular approach to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and sustainability analysis has been taken. This allows characterisation of discrete sections of supply chains and enables comparisons to be made between different crop production systems, different process systems and different end product uses. The purposes of this paper are to introduce the concepts of biofuel GHG and sustainability metrics, to introduce the approach taken by our organization and to use the example of UK grown willow in a lignocellulosic ethanol production system to demonstrate how GHG emission outcomes can be reviewed for "" new"" crops and technologies.The results show a range of variation, in both growing and process systems and how outcomes such as energy and GHG balances can be affected by various activities.LCA methodologies provide data to inform governments and industry of the potential specific supply chains may have for energy and GHG saving. However, methodological approaches can also affect assessment outcomes. Unresolved issues in LCA methodology must also be evaluated e.g. impacts resulting from land use change. Sustainability assessments of crop growing systems, irrespective of the end use, also assist in the assessment of environmental impacts of supply chains. However, it is critical that data continue to be collected, analysed and reviewed, to ensure that the most appropriate crops are grown and processed for the most appropriate end use. © 2011.","Life Cycle Assessment and sustainability methodologies for assessing industrial crops, processes and end products",Advanced biofuel technology *** Greenhouse gas (GHG) *** Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) *** Lignocellulosic ethanol *** Sustainability *** Willow,industrial crops and products,79958759380,2011,,,,,,

"In today's global business environment, supply chains have increased in both length and complexity. This increase in length and complexity coupled with a focus on improving efficiency, such as lean manufacturing practices, may lead to higher levels of supply chain risk where the likelihood of a disruption severely impacting supply chain performance increases. Resilient supply chains have been touted as a means to reduce the likelihood and severity of supply chain disruptions. However, there is little empirical evidence relative to the factors that contribute to or detract from supply resiliency. Using systems theory and the resource-based view of the firm as the theoretical underpinnings, this study provides an in-depth systematic investigation of supply resiliency. Adopting a theory-building approach based on a multi-industry empirical investigation, this study derives empirical generalizations linking 19 supply chain characteristics to supply resiliency. The study culminates in a framework that could be used to assess the level of resiliency in a supply base. Building on this framework, the study also provides a supply resiliency matrix that can be utilized to classify supply chains, or supply chains segments according to the level of resiliency realized.

"The need for integrated methodological framework for sustainability assessment has been widely discussed and is urgent due to increasingly complex environmental system problems. These problems have impacts on ecosystems and human well-being which represent a threat to economic performance of countries and corporations. Integrated assessment crosses issues; spans spatial and temporal scales; looks forward and backward; and incorporates multi-stakeholder inputs. This study aims to develop an integrated methodology by capitalizing the complementary strengths of different methods used by industrial ecologists and biophysical economists. The computational methodology proposed here is systems perspective, integrative, and holistic approach for sustainability assessment which attempts to link basic science and technology to policy formulation. The framework adopts life cycle thinking methods-LCA, LCC, and SLCA; stakeholders analysis supported by multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA); and dynamic system modelling. Following Pareto principle, the critical sustainability criteria, indicators and metrics (i.e., hotspots) can be identified and further modelled using system dynamics or agent based modelling and improved by data envelopment analysis (DEA) and sustainability network theory (SNT). The framework is being applied to development of biofuel supply chain networks. The framework can provide new ways of integrating knowledge across the divides between social and natural sciences as well as between critical and problem-solving research. © 2011 by the authors.",Advancing integrated systems modelling framework for life cycle sustainability assessment,Agent based modelling *** Biofuels *** Complexity dynamics *** Data envelopment analysis *** Integrated sustainability assessment *** Life cycle thinking *** Multi-criteria decision making *** Network theory *** Stakeholders analysis,sustainability,79960626161,2011,,,,,,
"This paper reviews existing literature to determine the drivers of and barriers to Enterprise Resource Planning II (ERPII) implementation. The ERPII literature is then extended through interviews with potential players in ERPII implementations to identify the critical success factors (CSFs) or preconditions required for successful implementation throughout supply chains. These interviews were conducted with leading ERP vendors/consultants and organisations involved in the entire supply chain to gather evidence on the success, or lack thereof, of ERPII implementations. The results were compared and contrasted to existing literature on ERPII, collaborative networks, and the extended enterprise. We found more barriers to than drivers of successful ERPII implementation. This leads prospective implementers to have a pessimistic forecast for ERPII implementation success. Our research reveals that main reason for this negativity is a general lack of understanding and appreciation of the capabilities of the extended enterprise network. Second, the research presents two sets of CSFs: CSFs which apply to traditional ERP and carry forward to apply to ERPII, and CSFs that are tailored to the new needs for successful ERPII implementations. Finally, the research questions the suitability of ERPII in today's modern business environment, and suggests that technology may have overtaken management's capabilities to capture the full benefits of such an advanced enterprise system. Future trends in ERPII development are also considered in an attempt to find the next phase in the enterprise system life cycle. Beyond ERPII, the research suggests that infrastructure such as large-scale business intelligence (BI) systems must be heavily incorporated into modern enterprise systems to fully understand how information flows throughout an organisation and to make sense of that information. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"The purpose of this study is to examine the non-perishable product food supply chain performance under a monopolistic environment. A system dynamics approach was used to study the behavior and relationships within a supply chain for a non-perishable product, and to determine the impact of demand variability and lead-time on supply chain performance. The proposed model facilitates identification and study of the critical components of the overall supply chain, allowing for the creation of an efficient and sustainable supply chain network. The modeling also provides a tool to generate multiple business situations for effective strategic planning and business decision-making. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"The inherent and growing complexity characterizing today's infrastructure systems has considerably increased their vulnerability to external disruptions. Recent world events have demonstrated how damage to one or more infrastructure components can result in disastrous political, social, and economic effects. This, in turn, has fostered the development of sophisticated quantitative methods that identify cost-effective ways of strengthening supply systems in the face of disruption. Stochastic and robust optimization can be used to tackle these strategic problems when uncertainty is present. The uncertainty dealt with in this article is related to the extent to which supply systems can be disrupted. More specifically, we propose and analyze different protection optimization models for minimizing the damage to a system resulting from the disruption of an uncertain number of system components. We compare a cost-based model and two original regret models that, to the best of our knowledge, represent the state of the art in the field of protection in location analysis. Also, we discuss how to build an operational envelope for the models considered, which can be used to identify the range of possible impacts associated with different protection strategies. The models are tested on a benchmark data set and on a new data set that was built using the Census 2001 data of the United Kingdom.We analyze and compare the protection plans generated by the models and provide some useful insights related to the robustness of the different modeling approaches. © 2011 by Association of American Geographers.",Optimizing protection strategies for supply chains: Comparing classic decision-making criteria in an uncertain environment,Fortification *** Interdiction *** Optimization *** Reliability *** Supply chains,annals of the association of american geographers,80052886607,2011,,,,,,
"Growing concerns about the environment make a supply chains' eco-footprint increasingly important, presuming that footprints are a more effective (policy) instrument than those currently in use. The eco-footprint comprises all kinds of environmental impact, but often is narrowed down to one aspect; e.g. the carbon footprint, material footprint, the water footprint, and so on. Although returns give rise to an additional goods flow from customers back to producers, it usually improves the eco-footprint due to the substitution effect. The reverse channel supplies high quality (recovered) products, components and materials to the forward channel thereby reducing the need for virgin sourcing and production. We refer to this as closed-loop recovery, as opposed to recovery for cascade markets which lacks substitution. To maximize substitution, the recovered items must re-enter the original supply chain. The feasibility of closed-loop recovery depends partly on the geographical proximity of forward and reverse facilities. We develop a decision framework for optimizing closed loop network configurations, i.e. the combined disposition and location-transport decision. We apply the framework to a single case study concerning one type of footprint (namely the carbon footprint) of a copier (closed-loop) supply chain. The main implication is that a regional network, with combined forward and reverse facilities per continent, proves most efficient and most robust in view of uncertain exogenous variables, but only when a full set of closed-loop options is available (including closed-loop recycling). As an embedded case, main contribution value of it lies in the discovery of a new phenomenon with generic implications; namely that not only the closed-loop supply chains footprint strongly depends on the substitution effect, but that in turn the feasibility of closed-loop recovery options depends heavily on the network design. From delineations of the study we derive issues for further research. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"This article investigates the robustness of different tactical planning and control policies for a softwood supply chain using an agent-based environment that simulates a distributed advanced planning and scheduling system and its corresponding supply chain operations. Simulations were modelled using a novel agent-based methodology combined with a robust experimental design approach and an industrial data set obtained from two companies in Eastern Canada. Experimental results provide insights about the dynamic relations among factors related to control levels, planning methods and planning horizon lengths. Results indicate that supply chain control levels play a relevant role in defining robust service levels, while the planning horizon and the planning method have lower impact in this context. In addition, from the supply chain inventory level point of view, we verified that the three investigated tactical rules have to be configured together if one desires to maximise their contribution for a robust supply chain system capable of coping with uncertainties from the business environment. When these rules are evaluated individually, it is not possible to make the most of their potential due to interactions between them. The article concludes by proposing an optimum robust configuration of the tactical rules to minimise the impact of supply chain uncertainties. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",Agent-based experimental investigations of the robustness of tactical planning and control policies in a softwood lumber supply chain,Agent-based simulation *** Robust design *** Softwood lumber industry *** Supply chain management *** Tactical planning,production planning and control,84855758512,2011,,,,,,
"Supply chain management has assumed a leading operations strategy position in both manufacturing and service industries, and over the past 10 years companies have seriously implemented supply chain management strategies in their organizations. Knowledge management (KM) is a major enabler of supply chain management, and is a critical element in information intensive and multi-cultured enterprise environments. Realizing the importance of knowledge management in supply chain (SC), an attempt has been made in this paper to propose a conceptual framework for KM in SC and to validate the framework with help of an empirical study conducted with French companies.

"Climate change is predicted to have major impacts on small-scale farmers in Mexico whose livelihoods depend on rain-fed maize. We examined the capacity of traditional maize seed systems to provide these farmers with appropriate genetic material under predicted agro-ecological conditions associated with climate change. We studied the structure and spatial scope of seed systems of 20 communities in four transects across an altitudinal gradient from 10-2,980 m above sea level in five states of eastern Mexico. Results indicate that 90% of all of the seed lots are obtained within 10 km of a community and 87% within an altitudinal range of ±50 m but with variation across four agro-climate environments: wet lowland, dry lowland, wet upper midlatitude, and highlands. Climate models suggest a drying and warming trend for the entire study area during the main maize season, leading to substantial shifts in the spatial distribution patterns of agro-climate environments. For all communities except those in the highlands, predicted future maize environments already are represented within the 10-km radial zones, indicating that in the future farmers will have easy access to adapted planting material. Farmers in the highlands are the most vulnerable and probably will need to acquire seed fromoutside their traditional geographical ranges. This change in seed sources probably will entail important information costs and the development of new seed and associated social networks, including improved linkages between traditional and formal seed systems and more effective and efficient seed-supply chains. The study has implications for analogous areas elsewhere in Mexico and around the world.",Assessing the vulnerability of traditional maize seed systems in Mexico to climate change,Adaptation *** Crop diversity *** Food security *** Genetic resources *** Landraces,proceedings of the national academy of sciences of the united states of america,80051996188,2011,,,,,,
"Engineering changes to products aim to correct design faults, exploit new market opportunities, improve overall product performance, or reduce production costs. These changes are thus considered as opportunities to stay competitive in the market place and companies strive to implement them in their products at the lowest possible costs. Such engineering changes in a collaborative environment require the original equipment manufacturer to work together with suppliers for designing, manufacturing, and marketing a product profitably. Simulation of an engineering change management process provides an understanding of important factors affecting the engineering change management process and helps in identifying any critical components of the entire process. In this research, system dynamics models have been developed to study the complex interrelationships among various members in a collaborative supply chain to achieve effective and efficient engineering change management processes. To address the complexity of the models, several standard templates have been developed and used. © 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited.",System dynamics modeling of engineering change management in a collaborative environment,Collaborative networks *** Engineering change management *** Modeling and simulation *** New product development *** System dynamics,international journal of advanced manufacturing technology,79961020476,2011,,,,,,
Any decision a company takes concerning the global expansion of its value network has major economic implications and is highly complex. Many diverse aspects must be taken into consideration when such a decision is made to ensure that a robust network is configured which will allow the company to be economically successful in the future in spite of the volatile environment it is affected by. It is against this context that the LMP and the wbk jointly developed a decision support method for the configuration and evaluation of the global expansion of value networks.

"We are witnessing an explosion in carbon calculators for estimating the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (i.e., carbon footprint) of households, buildings, cities, and processes. Seeking to capitalize on the emergent ""green"" consumer, corporations are leading the next iteration in carbon footprinting: consumer products. This potentially lucrative low-carbon frontier, however, faces steep challenges due to complexities of scale, largely a function of the number of actors and geographies involved in globalized commodity and energy networks, and scope, which increasingly demands inclusion of emissions due to land use change (e.g., bio fuel production, timber harvest, livestock grazing, mining). Life cycle assessment (LCA)-the principal method behind product level GHG emissions footprint protocols-frequently avoids these challenges by narrowly delineating system boundaries, thereby excluding the ""messiness"" of space and place. Through a comparative model of energy sources and emissions in the globalized paper industry, this article reveals how complexities associated with geographic variation and land use change create indeterminacy in footprints based on these protocols. Using industry and trade data, the authors develop geographic information system transportation and energy models to map the globally dispersed pulp supply networks and to rescale Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change GHG inventory guidelines to include carbon loss associated with land use change in the carbon footprint of coated paper. Given their integrative abilities to conceptualize and model coupled human-ecological systems, sophisticated understanding of time-space dynamics and critical theoretical insights, geographers have much to contribute to the LCA and product carbon footprinting enterprise, which to date has been largely the intellectual domain of engineers. © 2011 by Association of American Geographers.","""Papering"" over space and place: Product carbon footprint modeling in the global paper industry",Carbon labels *** Emissions *** Land use change *** Life cycle assessment *** Paper industry,annals of the association of american geographers,79958703036,2011,,,,,,
"Cellular manufacturing (CM) has been identified as an innovative practice for manufacturer to achieve efficiency as well as flexibility under an uncertain environment. This study addresses a new mathematical robust model for a cellular manufacturing problem integrated with tactical aspects under supply chain network characteristics in the presence of uncertain internal parameter (processing times) and external parameter (demands). The model aims to minimize total cost consisting expected value and variance of tactical cost (scheduling), strategic cost (employment of suppliers in supply chain network) to produce exceptional elements as well as the cost of resource underutilization. The model can give up a series of the solutions that are less sensitive to the changes in input data. To solve the robust model, an efficient hybrid method based on new combination of genetic algorithm (GA), simulated annealing (SA) in a parallel structure are proposed under an optimization rule. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated by numerical results and the trade-off between solution robustness and model robustness is also analyzed. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Integrating Strategic and Tactical Decisions to Robust Designing of Cellular Manufacturing under Uncertainty: Fixed Suppliers in Supply Chain,Cellular manufacturing *** group scheduling *** Parallel solution method *** Robust optimization *** Uncertain demand and processing time,international journal of computational intelligence systems,84860875709,2011,,,,,,
"The notion of social capital or embeddedness has received increased attention in the field of supply chain management. However, although embeddedness has both a structural and a relational aspect, the structural has received more focus. In addition, circumstances that may affect the development of social capital, and the role and import of a focal firm's supply management function on aspects of social capital, remain unclear. This study draws on the social network perspective to explore factors associated with the relational embeddedness of social capital, and investigate the role of supply management on the process. Using empirical data collected from 204 U.S. manufacturing firms, an empirical framework is proposed and tested using structural equation modeling. The results of this study suggest a mechanism through which social capital affects firm performance, and indicate that the supply management function may contribute to sustainable competitive advantage. The study confirms that the relational embeddedness aspect of social capital should be treated as a critical antecedent to performance. It also highlights the potential role of the supply management function in developing social capital in dyadic network interactions. © 2009 Institute for Supply Management, Inc.™.",The effect of supply management on aspects of social capital and the impact on performance: A social network perspective,Relational embeddedness *** Social capital *** Social network analysis *** Strategic purchasing *** Supply interactions *** Supply management *** Survey methods,journal of supply chain management,72449164889,2010,,,,,,
"Agri-food enterprises operate in a complex and dynamic environment. To meet increasing demands of consumers, government and business partners, enterprises continuously have to work on innovations of products, processes and ways of cooperation in agri-food supply chain networks (AFSCN). Hence, a development towards a more knowledge-based economy is needed. The Lisbon strategy, launched by the European Union, to attain this knowledge-based economy, has failed so far. This paper argues that information sharing and organizing ICT are main critical areas to overcome this deadlock. However, ICT development in AFSCN involves an information integration task that has to deal with technical and organizational requirements and starts with an existing installed base. Traditional software engineering approaches are inadequate to address these issues. This paper provides an overall method for analysis, design and implementation of information integration, taking technical as well as organizational development into account. The method was derived from experiences in a research and development program in the Dutch arable farming sector. A generic integration framework forms the backbone of the method to ensure systematic and sustainable ICT development. Business process management (BPM), in combination with reference information models, plays an important role. The technical architecture and infrastructure are based on a service-oriented architecture (SOA). Attention is paid to the organizational infrastructure that is needed to embed the results in the right context, so that they will be broadly supported and used. The method is divided into three phases: analysis, basic design and iterative implementation. Analysis of the current situation in AFSCN is supported by an information integration framework. The basic design is a first version of the generic integration framework. In the iterative implementation phase, pilot projects are guided by this basic design, which results in incremental growth of the framework. The pilot projects follow a Living Lab (LL) approach. LLs represent a user-centric, open innovation approach for sensing, prototyping, validating and refining complex solutions in multiple and evolving real life contexts. The method is illustrated by an application to the Dutch arable farming sector. It can be concluded that the contribution of the presented method lies in combining different methodologies into a design approach for information integration, based on a sound architecture. The presented method leads to ICT that follows the business processes in real life and thus enhances appropriate information sharing to support a knowledge-based economy. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"Social systems are evolving, multi-scale, spatio-temporal structures with emergent functions, needs and capabilities. One sensible definition of an extreme event would be one that led to some qualitative, structural change in the system, as it went beyond the current control limits of the system. Indeed, we can view any current structure and organization that characterize a system as being forged out of the past events and crises that led to change and innovation. Each individual, group, firm, corporation, shareholder and observer experience path-dependent learning, whereby current learning is conditional by the events and decisions taken in the past. In reality, the new system or structure that comes into being at a given time, although initially seen as a successful response to some past problem, will move into an unknowable future that will necessarily end in some new crisis, the emergence of some unexpected new factors, effects or implications that will have to be dealt with. A simple probabilistic model of event dynamics is presented showing that the discussions of power laws and self-organized criticality assume a stationary situation and the probability of given events. We contrast this with examples from human systems that are about qualitative, structural change and path-dependent learning. The first example involves the handling of severe motorway traffic accidents and the second describes the evolution of supply chains by trial and error, as new practices are adopted or rejected in a changing competitive economic environment. Social and economic systems must evolve, and will do so through the occurrence of seemingly extreme events, requiring adaptation and change. The important lesson therefore is to accept that there will be always a potential for unexpected and surprising events and that we need to build systems that are robust and resilient to their occurrence. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.",The evolutionary complexity of social and economic systems: The inevitability of uncertainty and surprise,Complexity *** Evolution *** Instability *** Power laws,risk management,76249098656,2010,,,,,,

"Operations research (OR) methodologies in optimization have been extensively applied to problems in different agricultural value chains in recent years. We take a critical stock take of such applications to date, and reflect on their contribution to value chain sustainability and resilience. The stock take shows that the rate of industry or policy adoption has been limited, partly due to the complex interactions across the segments of agricultural value chains, and the mathematical representation being different to the way the decision maker understands the problem. OR practice in agriculture is also being asked to cover greater spatial scales and engage more stakeholders, and is required to embrace resilience and sustainability objectives. A single-minded focus on optimizing parts of these complex systems without considering the whole system is no longer adequate, and new methods and approaches are required. Complex systems science methods are being applied to analyse the dynamics of complex social-ecological systems, and are starting to find a home in industrial supply chain analysis. We demonstrate how three complex system methods, agent-based modelling, dynamical systems modelling and network analysis, can be applied to agricultural value chains as a means of gaining insights into system dynamics under different and dynamic conditions. The relevance and utility of OR in ensuring the success of agricultural value chains into the future will require practitioners to understand and model value chains as complex adaptive systems. © 2010 Operational Research Society Ltd.

"This paper examines a number of electronic data interchange (EDI) usage and implementation factors and their role in improving a firm's efficiency, productivity and competitiveness. Unlike other studies in the literature that use exclusively linear models, we apply nonlinear neural networks to model the relationship between performance improvement and a set of predictor variables of EDI usage and supply chain coordination activities. A variable selection method is employed to identify key factors to predict a firm's operational excellence due to EDI implementation. In addition, a bootstrap resampling scheme is used to evaluate the robustness of the results. Note to Practitioners-Competing successfully in a highly competitive environment requires firms to coordinate well with their suppliers and customers. In this paper, we study the issue of how EDI implementation activities and usage affect a firm's performance. Our research has several important implications to practitioners. First, although a firm's performance improvement in several key areas may be attributed to many different aspects of EDI use and coordination activities, only a few key variables are critical. By focusing on a few key coordination activities and EDI implementation issues, managers are able to achieve significant performance improvement in efficiency, productivity, and competitiveness. Second, we find that coordination activities through the implementation of EDI can clearly improve many facets of a firm's performance, developing strategic alliances with supply chain partners is essential in enhancing both a firm's and its supply chain's competitiveness. Third, while using the basic routine EDI can improve efficiency, it is the enhanced use of the EDI system that contributes more to the productivity improvement and firm competitiveness. © 2009 IEEE.",Modeling the relationship between EDI implementation and firm performance improvement with neural networks,Electronic data interchange *** Neural networks *** Nonlinear modeling *** Resampling *** Supply chain management *** Variable selection,ieee transactions on automation science and engineering,73849108598,2010,,,,,,
"An argument for stability is derived for multiagent systems characterized by resource sharing and algorithm selection. These multiagent systems reflect the trends of modern information systems and the argument made here can serve as a guide to designing robust multiagent systems. The argument is that fairness leads to stability and consequently optimality. The fairness is allocating resources according to the utilities achievable by individual agents. On the other hand, unfairness arises when resources are allocated strictly equally or as reserved beforehand. The source of instability is identified as excess resources resulting from the unfairness. Since excess resources of some agents can be utilized by others, a system becomes vulnerable to instability due to the interactions from resource sharing. The fairness eliminates excess resources and agents become securing definite valuations of resources, as a result of utility-maximizing behaviors. As a consequence, the system reaches an optimal equilibrium voluntarily after any perturbation. Note to Practitioners-Multiagent system designers must understand the collective behavior resulting from the interactions between agents in order to build robust systems. For this purpose, there have been efforts to provide appropriate arguments of stability depending on the nature of system. For example, agent diversity was identified as a key to stabilizing computational ecosystem model and information sharing to supply chain networks. This paper drives an argument of stability for the multiagent systems characterized by resource sharing and algorithms selection. Individual systems are increasingly sharing resources and software systems are becoming capable of adapting to environmental changes through alternative algorithms. The argument is that fairness in such multiagent systems leads to stability and consequently optimality. However, despite of pursuing fairness, there can be diverse obstacles that give rise to unfairness. These obstacles are the limitations of the argument made and, hence, it is needed to extend the argument with respect to these limitations in future research.","Fairness, Stability and Optimality of Adaptive Multiagent Systems: Interaction Through Resource Sharing",Adaptive multiagent systems *** algorithm selection *** fairness *** optimality *** resource sharing *** stability,ieee transactions on automation science and engineering,WOS:000281938500002,2010,,,,,,
"Purpose - The increasing focus on environmental sustainability and social responsibility within business agendas often leads to expectations that solutions lie in the downscaling, decentralising and deconsolidating of supply chains and logistics systems. This is no more acute than within the climate change agenda, the single biggest environmental challenge to industry today. The purpose of this paper is to challenge these notions and suggest that environmental burden actually decreases across increasing logistical scale and supply chain sophistication. Design/methodology/approach - Primary and secondary life cycle analysis and carbon auditing case evidence detailing and describing operations throughout the food supply chain is used to show what happens to resource efficiency when we chose possible downscaling routes. Findings - The paper contends that the principle of economic efficiency leading to environmental efficiency (or lean is green) is more generally applicable against our previous expectations and that supply chain sophistication and logistical scale is more likely to lead to environmental benefit rather than cost. Practical implications - From a commercial and industrial point of view, the paper provides evidence to promote conventional supply chain management good practice as a means of driving the demand needed for the technological change required to achieve climate change targets. This is good news for suppliers and distributors, particularly in the light of global economic conditions. From a consumer and policy perspective, the upshot of the paper is a call for more pragmatic thinking and a reminder that critical evidence-based decision making should be used when judging how best to formulate supply strategies. Originality/value - This paper represents a fresh way of thinking utilising more robust evidence amongst a set of issues that have become precariously muddled and confused.",Sensible operational choices for the climate change agenda,Climate change *** Resource efficiency *** Sustainable supply chains,international journal of logistics management,WOS:000287115800008,2010,,,,,,
"Environmental issues, resource re-usage and information technology applications (ITA) are gaining interest in supply chain management researches. Critical environmental legislation has become common in all level of company operations. Green product design has a significant influence on the cost of purchase, disassembly, component inspection and repair, remanufacturing and recycling. Recently, the development and improved capabilities of ITA have changed the ways in which the supply chain operates. However, the traditional inventory model considers a case in which depletion of inventory is caused by a constant rate. In practice, there is an inventory loss due to deterioration. This paper investigates the impact of the green product design, the deteriorating factor and the ITA investment in business process considering remanufacturing. An integrated inventory deteriorating model is developed, considering green product design and remanufacturing. The integrated production-inventory deteriorating model for replenishment policy and distribution planning is derived utilising a time-weighted inventory approach. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the theory. The results show that new technology evolution, reusable-item take-back ratio and direct shipment are the critical operation factors in green product design and ITA investment.",Green-product-design value and information-technology investment on replenishment model with remanufacturing,deteriorating model *** green product design *** information technology applications investment *** remanufacturing,international journal of computer integrated manufacturing,WOS:000277472400007,2010,,,,,,
"The planning activity of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) collection networks is a topic of interest for researchers and managers, due to both the complexity of the problem and its important practical implications, in accordance with the guidelines that recent laws have addressed in a large number of industrialized countries. Nevertheless, even if these new legislation directives aim to reduce the critical effects of human activities on the environment, approaches for coupling the planning phase of a WEEE transportation network with the analysis of its environmental impact are rare in literature. Specifically, in this paper, a WEEE transportation network in the North of Italy (precisely, in the Reggio Emilia district) is addressed by means of an integrated solution approach. The methodological steps regard the following topics: data collection techniques, vehicle routing methods and heuristic procedures for creating different system scenarios, simulation modelling for obtaining solutions satisfying technical performance measures, LCA methodology for assessing the environmental impact of such solutions, multi-criteria decision methods for selecting the best choice under the joint technical and environmental perspective.

"Multinational companies have recently been encouraged by government policies to implement Extended Producer Responsibility. One objective is to stimulate high-level recovery, and the other is to introduce life cycle thinking. This paper studies decision making in recovery, comparing opportunistic decision making with short-term profit maximization (usually leading to one loop) versus a life-cycle perspective (leading to multiple loops). The question is (1) which business benefits this brings as well as reduction of environmental impact and (2) whether companies should be inclined to think multi-loop and if so how governments could stimulate this. After comparing the problem with the literature, a non-linear optimization model is presented optimizing NPV of revenues and calculating environmental impact with cumulative energy demand and cumulative recovery rates. The environmental indicators chosen are motivated based on literature research in the area of streamlined LCA. Sensitivity analysis tests solutions on various sources of uncertainty. We study a real-life case with real data. Based on the results, we can formulate the following insights for industry. Firstly, cascade markets for reuse may appear attractive but new sales cannibalization compromised margins. To neutralize this effect, returns should be remanufactured to equal-to-new quality hence no difference should exist between new and recovered items. Companies must suppress their natural instincts of maximizing short-term profits and delay some of the revenues by implementing multi-loop models in order to maximize total life-cycle profit. Environmental impact improves as well according to both indicators. Feasibility of returns should be maximized which for example implies careful collection and storage of wrecks, preventing damage and corrosion, etc. Product design changes may further enhance feasibility. However, the concept requires that all loops are controlled well by one actor. For governments the following advices apply. As mentioned, most EPR-based systems in place today maximize single loop 3. Using alternative steering principles instead of target quota on recovery and collection could stimulate multi-loop solutions that prove more robust, more profitable, and have better footprint. It is concluded that multi-loop recovery is preferred both economically and environmentally. But both industry and governments must improve their policies. Therefore, future research is mapped based on handles and delineations of the study.",Opportunistic versus life-cycle-oriented decision making in multi-loop recovery: an eco-eco study on disposed vehicles,Automotive case study *** Disposition *** Environmental impact *** Legislation *** Life cycle *** Net present value *** Streamlined LCA,international journal of life cycle assessment,WOS:000281394000002,2010,,,,,,
"While there are several studies on human resource management (HRM) at the inter-firm dyadic relationship level, the HR aspects of intra-firm strategic supply relationships have been largely ignored. Yet interdependence requires coordination among functions, sites, and stages of the internal supply chain (SC). Drawing on a case study of a large European pharmaceutical company, which we call Tyrenco, we explore how HR practices evolve within the strategic intra-firm supply relationship. Our findings illustrate the disruptive effects of HR practices when they are focused on site-based objectives and the improved coordination that results from redesigning HR processes to achieve internal operational integration. We highlight the tension between site-based, financial controls and an emergent SC logic. Drawing on recent interest in cooperative approaches to HR practices, this study seeks to operationalize the need to align HR practices with end-to-end objectives at different stages of the intra-firm supply chain. Our findings have practical implications for designing HR practices within multinational corporations (MNCs) that are characterized by complex and fragmented internal environments.

"The use of the mathematical programming approach to the synthesis of chemical processes has many valuable creative principles, i.e. optimality, feasibility and integrality of solutions, which are essential for obtaining truly integrated sustainable solutions. However, our tools are still insufficient to perform the sustainable product-process synthesis integrally across the whole chemical supply chain. The ongoing development of concepts, methods and computer applications thus remains the most important role of the PSE community in order to provide engineers with powerful systems tools with which to shape sustainable development. The task, however, is very challenging even at the level of process synthesis since we are dealing with multi-criteria, an enormous amount of complex interactions, uncertainties, discrete and continuous decisions, giving rise to the use of the simultaneous, mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) approach. Although several efficient MINLP solvers have been developed in the last two decades, hardly any academic or professional MINLP synthesizer for solving such nontrivial synthesis problems has been developed so far. The present contribution wishes to shed light on some important issues relating to different challenges that had to and still have to be mastered as well as various capabilities which in turn were rewarded by mastering some of the challenges during the development of the advanced mixed-integer process synthesizer (MipSyn), the successor of the process synthesizer PROSYN-MINLP (Kravanja & Grossmann, 1990, 1994). The primary aim of future research is oriented towards the development of an even more advanced and robust synthesizer shell, capable of solving large-scale sustainable applications in different engineering domains.

"Purpose: Within the context of a sustainable supply chain, the purpose of this paper is to report on empirical longitudinal research on supply chain network evolution and dynamics of governance in a multi-stakeholder supply chain sustainability initiative led by Nespresso, the speciality coffee division of Nestlé. Design/methodology/approach: The paper proposes a framework to study the creation and evolution of governance mechanisms over a five-year period. Data from 48 semi-structured interviews and 15 recent and historic documents were also analysed. The interviews were conducted among current and past representatives of all the organisations concerned including coffee traders, NGOs and farmers. Findings: In contrast with literature on the subject, governance mechanisms initially relied mostly on informal mechanisms. Formal governance mechanisms were incorporated into the relationships to enable the supply chain network to grow and to provide clarity to all actors. Relational quality processes that increased trust were critical elements in the early phase, and were explicitly built into a second phase of development. Research limitations/implications: Being a single case study, some caution needs to be applied to generalise findings beyond the specific context studied. An additional methodological limitation is the limited number of actors involved in the overall supply chain network. Practical implications: The paper shows the importance of treating governance mechanisms within the supply chain not as a fixed variable to be determined once and for all in the beginning of a relationship, but rather to adapt the coordination mechanisms of the relationships. Originality/value: The evolution of relationships over time has been ""often called for but rarely chosen"". The case highlights the potential benefits of this type of research to develop an understanding of the evolution of relationships in a supply chain network. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Nestlé Nespresso AAA sustainable quality program: An investigation into the governance dynamics in a multi-stakeholder supply chain network,Coffee *** Economic sustainability *** Governance *** Supply chain management,supply chain management,77949331689,2010,,,,,,
"As companies continue to globalise their operations and outsource significant portion of their value chain activities, they often end up relying heavily on order replenishments from distant suppliers. The explosion in long-distance sourcing is exposing supply chains and shareholder value at ever increasing operational and disruption risks. It is well established, both in academia and in real-world business environments, that resource flexibility is an effective method for hedging against supply chain disruption risks. In this contextual framework, we propose a single period stochastic inventory decision-making model that could be employed for capturing the trade-off between inventory policies and disruption risks for an unreliable dual sourcing supply network for both the capacitated and uncapacitated cases. Through the developed model, we obtain some important managerial insights and evaluate the merit of contingency strategies in managing uncertain supply chains. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",A stochastic inventory management model for a dual sourcing supply chain with disruptions,Disruption *** Dual sourcing *** Inventory management *** Stochastic model *** Supply chain design *** Supply chain resilience,international journal of systems science,77951109163,2010,,,,,,
"In this paper, the Inoperability Input-Output Model (IIM) is deployed for assessing the impacts of disruptive events on supply chain networks under an unsafe environment. The IIM for supply chain networks has been proposed, based on the original IIM used in macro-economics. A new method called the OWA (Ordered Weighted Averaging) Operator has been formulated to evaluate the interdependency matrix, a key component of the IIM. Similar to the capability of the basic IIM to describe the propagation impacts of disruptions to macroeconomic systems, the IIM for supply chain networks is capable of describing the propagation effects of disruptions to interdependent supply chain components. IIM assesses the impacts of disruptions to supply chain networks with ""inoperability"" and ""economic losses"" metrics, which can provide helpful insights for risk management of supply chain networks. An example supply chain network is used to illustrate the application of IIM for systemic risk assessment of supply chains under an unsafe environment. A risk mitigation strategy by increasing the number of suppliers has been considered to reduce the adverse effects caused by the supply reduction of the single secondary supplier in the example supply chain network. In addition, a simulation model integrated with Monte Carlo simulation method has been developed to validate the accuracy of the IIM for supply chain. The example shows that the application of IIM can provide useful guidance toward supply chain risk management or mitigation strategies and it could also be used to test the effectiveness of these strategies. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Inoperability input-output modeling (IIM) of disruptions to supply chain networks,decision analysis *** disruptions *** inoperability input-output model *** robustness metrics *** supply chain safety,systems engineering,78649867611,2010,,,,,,
"The aim of this study is to show how a timed Petri nets framework can be used to model and analyze a supply chain (SC) network which is subject to various risks. The method is illustrated by an industrial case study. We first investigate the disruption factors of the SC network by a failure mode, effects and criticality analysis (FMECA) technique. We then integrate the risk management procedures into design, planning, and performance evaluation process of supply chain networks through Petri net (PN) based simulation. The developed PN model provides an efficient environment for defining uncertainties in the system and evaluating the added value of the risk mitigation actions. The findings of the case study shows that the system performance can be improved using risk management actions and the overall system costs can be reduced by mitigation scenarios. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"The development of renewable energy sources has clearly emerged as a promising policy towards enhancing the fragile global energy system with its limited fossil fuel resources, as well as for reducing the related environmental problems. In this context, waste biomass utilization has emerged as a viable alternative for energy production, encompassing a wide range of potential thermochemical, physicochemical and bio-chemical processes. Two significant bottlenecks that hinder the increased biomass utilization for energy production are the cost and complexity of its logistics operations. In this manuscript, we present a critical synthesis of the relative state-of-the-art literature as this applies to all stakeholders involved in the design and management of waste biomass supply chains (WBSCs). We begin by presenting the generic system components and then the unique characteristics of WBSCs that differentiate them from traditional supply chains. We proceed by discussing state-of-the-art energy conversion technologies along with the resulting classification of all relevant literature. We then recognize the natural hierarchy of the decision-making process for the design and planning of WBSCs and provide a taxonomy of all research efforts as these are mapped on the relevant strategic, tactical and operational levels of the hierarchy. Our critical synthesis demonstrates that biomass-to-energy production is a rapidly evolving research field focusing mainly on biomass-to-energy production technologies. However, very few studies address the critical supply chain management issues, and the ones that do that, focus mainly on (i) the assessment of the potential biomass and (ii) the allocation of biomass collection sites and energy production facilities. Our analysis further allows for the identification of gaps and overlaps in the existing literature, as well as of critical future research areas. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Waste biomass-to-energy supply chain management: A critical synthesis, ,waste management,77956262709,2010,,,,,,
"The supply chain networks could be very fragile in global environment due to unexpected events such as emergencies, normal disruptions and industrial accidents. The supply chain members may lose their production capacities temporarily, which might have significant impacts on the performance of the whole supply chain network. This article proposes a discrete time model to characterise the unreliable production capacity in serial supply chain networks. Based on the proposed model, the exact probability distributions are available for the performance analysis of a single-stage system in the lost sales scenario. The iterative methods are developed to derive the approximate performance measures for single-stage systems in the backorder scenario and multi-stage systems in both the lost sales and backorder scenarios. The proposed methods are verified through a series of numerical experiments. The analysis results suggest that the performance of the supply chain network suffers more from the downstream-stage unreliability than the upstream-stage unreliability. Furthermore, some application examples are illustrated to show the possible solutions for practical problems. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Performance analysis of serial supply chain networks considering system disruptions,aggregation *** Bernoulli server *** discrete time Markov chain *** risk *** supply chain management,production planning and control,78649512963,2010,,,,,,
"Like many others, Textileapparel companies have to deal with a very competitive environment and have to manage consumers which become more demanding. Thus, to stay competitive, companies rely on sophisticated information systems and logistic skills, and especially accurate and reliable forecasting systems. However, forecasters have to deal with some singular constraints of the textileapparel market such as for instance the volatile demand, the strong seasonality of sales, the wide number of items with short life cycle or the lack of historical data. To respond to these constraints, companies have implemented specific forecasting systems often simple but robust. After the study of existing practices in the clothing industry, we propose different forecasting models which perform more accurate and more reliable sales forecasts. These models rely on advanced methods such as fuzzy logic, neural networks and data mining. In order to evaluate the benefits of these methods for the supply chain and more especially for the reduction of the bullwhip effect, a simulation based on real data of sourcing and forecasting processes is performed and analyzed. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

"When environmental problems are the focus, conflicts between the general public and company stakeholders affect both regional and global cooperation prompting conflicts in many areas. As a consequence, various initiatives have been designed and adopted that improve environmental performance while maintaining sustainable development. Green purchasing is applied as a useful tool to mitigate the environmental impacts of consumption and to promote clean production technology. The supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model is proposed by a supply chain council as a standard supply chain performance evaluation model. This model has been widely embraced by many modern organisations. The SCOR model can be applied to analyse supply chain performance in a systematic way. It can also aid in communication among all members in the supply chain, and can assist in the development of a design for a better supply chain network. To further improve the performance of the green purchasing process, which is critical in numerous industries, this study explores the relationship between the plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycle of green purchasing and the SCOR purchasing/sourcing process and its performance indices/metrics. In this study, those companies which produce Taiwanese green label products are taken as samples. The PDSA cycle of green purchasing and the SCOR model are used to construct a structural equation model (SEM). An SEM analysis is conducted to establish the relationship between the PDSA of green purchasing, the sourcing process, and its performance on the SCOR model. The results of this study provide some suggestions for companies conducting green purchasing. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",A study on the relationship between the PDSA cycle of green purchasing and the performance of the SCOR model,Green purchasing *** PDSA cycle *** Structural equation model (SEM) *** Supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model,total quality management and business excellence,78650298980,2010,,,,,,
"In a global economic environment, many enterprises expend their overseas markets and implement outsourcing of logistics activities to external carriers. Many enterprises pay close attention to successful delivery of their freight. Hence, how to determine the optimal carrier selection is a very critical issue for global enterprises. Generally, there are several carriers to serve on each route connecting two cities (or transfer stations) in the logistics network. Each carrier owns multiple available capacities with a probability distribution because the carrier's capacity may be partially reserved for other orders. A carrier selection means selecting exact one carrier on each route, and the logistics network according to the carrier selection is thus a stochastic logistic network. The network reliability is a performance index of freight delivery for supply chain management and is defined as the probability that d units of commodity are successfully transmitted from a supplier to a customer. This study focuses on the optimal carrier selection problem based on network reliability criterion. A GA-based algorithm that combines the minimal paths and the recursive sum of disjoint products is developed to determine the optimal carrier selection with the maximal network reliability. A practical logistics example of the LCD monitors delivery from Asia to Europe is presented to illustrate the solution procedure. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

"Recent supply chain accidents due to epidemics, terrorist attacks and severe earthquake in Haiti killing thousands of people as well as typhoon over Manila causing flood to wash out millions worth of property, indicate that firms are vulnerable in today's highly integrated supply chains. Global financial crisis started in the mid 2007 has also brought further implications on supply chain problems. As economic recession reached the bottom line, supply chain managers experience a different kind of risks as the source of vulnerability. The effectiveness of supply chain mitigation strategy which provide a greater ability to respond volatile circumstances is immediate important. This study explores the perspectives of managers in the manufacturing firms on supply chain vulnerability and mitigation strategy within Indonesian environment. The result reveals that supply chain vulnerability is a relatively new concept for them. However, their firms have implemented certain mitigation actions to avoid fatality in the supply chain network. © Medwell Journals, 2010.",Supply chain vulnerability and mitigation strategy of the manufacturing firms in Indonesia: Manager's perspectives,Indonesia *** Manufacturing sector *** Mitigation strategy *** Supply chain vulnerability,international business management,78149476360,2010,,,,,,
"Capacity planning in the reverse channel of closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) involves complex issues due to the different lifecycles of product offerings in combination with the variability regarding product usage time, quality level of used products and return patterns. (Georgiadis, P., Vlachos, D., Tagaras, G., 2006. The impact of product lifecycle on capacity planning of closed-loop supply chains with remanufacturing. Production and Operations Management 15; 514-527) developed a system dynamics (SD) model to study a CLSC with remanufacturing for a single product which incorporates a dynamic capacity modeling approach. We extend this SD model for two sequential product-types under two alternative scenarios regarding the market preferences over the product-types; in the first scenario, the market is considered showing no preferences, while in the second scenario, the demand over a product-type can be satisfied only by providing units of the specific type. We study how the joint lifecycles of two product-types, entry time of the second product-type to the market and used product return patterns affect the optimal policies regarding expansion and contraction of collection and remanufacturing capacities. The results of extensive numerical investigation are tested for their statistical significance using analysis of variance (ANOVA). In the first scenario, the results show that the system performs best when the two lifecycles form a trapezoid pattern for total demand while in the second scenario, when the two lifecycles form a triangular pattern. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Environmental consciousness has become critical in the design and operation of globally integrated supply chain networks. This research examines the carbon footprint across supply chains and thus contributes to the knowledge and practice of green supply chain management. The analytical model uses the long-range Lagrangian and the Eulerian transport methods. Analytical and finite difference methods are used to approximate the three-dimensional infinite footprint model. A simplified numerical example validates and illustrates the proposed approach. The results show that carbon emissions across stages in a supply chain can constitute a significant threat that warrants careful attention in the design phase of supply chains. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.,Modeling carbon footprints across the supply chain,Carbon footprint *** Eulerian box model *** Green supply chain management *** Heat link *** Lagrangian box model,international journal of production economics,77957822063,2010,,,,,,
"In recent years, with the raising of awareness in environmental protection and sustainable development in enterprises, the green issue has become more and more critical in supply chain management. This study intends to develop a green supplier selection model which integrates artificial neural network (ANN) and two multi-attribute decision analysis (MADA) methods: data envelopment analysis (DEA) and analytic network process (ANP). It is called ANN-MADA hybrid method. ANN-MADA hybrid method considers both practicality in traditional supplier selection criteria and environmental regulations. It also overcomes traditional DEA drawbacks, limitations of data accuracy and decision-making units (DMUs) amounts constraint. The model evaluation results of an international well-known camera manufacturer indicate that the ANN-MADA hybrid method outperforms two other hybrid methods, ANN-DEA and ANP-DEA. It was also discovered that ANN-MADA has better power of discrimination and noise-insensitivity in evaluating green suppliers' performances. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"This paper discusses Supply Chain Network (SCN) design problem under uncertainty, and presents a critical review of the optimization models proposed in the literature. Some drawbacks and missing aspects in the literature are pointed out, thus motivating the development of a comprehensive SCN design methodology. Through an analysis of supply chains uncertainty sources and risk exposures, the paper reviews key random environmental factors and discusses the nature of major disruptive events threatening SCN. It also discusses relevant strategic SCN design evaluation criteria, and it reviews their use in existing models. We argue for the assessment of SCN robustness as a necessary condition to ensure sustainable value creation. Several definitions of robustness, responsiveness and resilience are reviewed, and the importance of these concepts for SCN design is discussed.

"An efficient integration of production and distribution plans into a unified framework is critical to achieving competitive advantage. This paper addresses the production and distribution planning problem in a supply chain system that involves the allocation of production volumes among the different production lines in the manufacturing plants, and the delivery of the products to the distribution centers. An integrated optimization model for production and distribution planning is proposed, with the aimed of optimally coordinating important and interrelated logistics decisions. However, a real supply chain operates in a highly dynamic and uncertain environment. Therefore, this model is transformed into fuzzy models taking into account the fuzziness in the capacity constraints, and the aspiration level of costs using different aggregation operators. The applicability and flexibility of the proposed models are illustrated through a case study in consumer goods industry. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

"Geographical indications (GIs) are place-based names that conveythe geographical origin, as well as the cultural and historical identity, of agricultural products. GIs are unique, in that they provide ameans of ensuring that control over production and sales of a product stays within a local area, but at the same time they make use of extralocal markets. Although control over GIs largely rests with local actors, GIs are nested in wider regional, national, and international networks; and the passage from local to extralocal markets introduces new costs and benefits and new relations of power into the supply chain. The degree to which GI protection spurs development and protects local environmental and cultural resources depends on the structure of the GI legislation and on the territorial context in which protection is embedded. Using a commodity-chains approach, I compare two GI production systems, tequila in Mexico and Comté cheese in France, in order to develop a theory of the factors that contribute to more sustainable, equitable GI production systems. I argue that three key differences in the design of the GI schemes help to explain the varying effects of the two cases: (1) the manner in which supply-chain actors define quality, (2) the way that the GI valorizes the terroir of the region, and (3) the strength and cohesion that the collective organizing body exhibits. Moreover, the institutional and political context in which GI supply chains ""touch down"" plays a critical role. Contrary to a conceptualization of GIs as compatible with a purely market-oriented model, my comparison of these two cases indicates that some level of state involvement, in order to level the playing field and empower small farmers, is a necessary, although not sufficient, precondition for successful and sustainable GIs. © 2010, by the Rural Sociological Society.",Embedding local places in global spaces: Geographical indications as a territorial development strategy, ,rural sociology,77954771241,2010,,,,,,
"Introduction: The biannual Life Cycle Management conference series aims to create a platform for users and developers of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and related tools to share their experiences. A key concern of the LCM community has been to move beyond the production of LCA reports toward using the developed knowledge. This paper reports and evaluates some of the main outcomes of the 4th International Life Cycle Management Conference (LCM 2009). Results: Conference focus: While the focus of the conference was LCM, LCA remains a main analytical tool for supporting LCM. This is clearly shown by the overall program in which roughly half of the contributions focused on or used LCA. Some products and resources and environmental themes were markedly represented in the presentation subjects. Conference participation: The 180 delegates included 40 South Africans, 20 from other African countries, and 140 from as far afield as Brazil, Sweden, Japan, and Australia. The surveyable number of delegates and conference rooms, in combination with the well-balanced scientific and social program, facilitated optimal professional exchange and discussion. Conference structure: LCM 2009 featured some 140 contributions from 47 leading environmental practitioners, consultants, and academic researchers. The interactive conference format included three plenary sessions and training workshops. Conclusions: LCM 2009 successfully engaged with the critical questions of what it means to manage (not merely shift) the environmental and social impacts of global economic activity, what this entails for industry and public services in emerging economies, and how supply chains, networks, and partnerships can be stimulated and managed to deliver truly sustainable practice. © 2010 US Government.",From life cycle talking to taking action: The 4th International Conference on Life Cycle Management: The Global Challenge of Managing Life Cycles,Conference *** Life cycle assessment *** Life cycle management *** Social impacts *** Sustainability,international journal of life cycle assessment,77953028933,2010,,,,,,
"The traditional definition of sustainability calls for policies and strategies that meet society's present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Through the 1970 National Environmental Policy Act, U.S. policy formally established the goal of creating and maintaining ""conditions under which [humans] and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans."" However, we have not yet succeeded in making sustainability operational. The long-standing and current debates on setting energy policy, regulating greenhouse gases, and promoting alternate fuels illustrate the complexity of making sustainability operational. Achieving operational sustainability requires three critical elements: advances in science and technology, application of effective government regulations and policies, and green business practices. Not only are these elements necessary, all three must work together across the economy. A key lesson drawn from the history of environmental regulation and especially in the climate debate is that sustainability cannot be advanced without a convergence of government and business interests even when the requisite technology is available. The biofuel system presents an immediate and tangible test case for the successful interaction of these three critical elements. The massive investments in science and technology by both government and industry to develop new feedstocks and conversion methods are showing promise. From a regulatory perspective, existing statutes and new mandates impact all parts of the biofuel supply chain-a complex system involving feedstocks, conversion technologies, transport, storage, handling, and end use. Forward-looking businesses in the biofuel sector are integrating sustainability objectives into their business strategies, such as designing feedstock conversion processes to generate biofuel coproducts that can add substantial revenue. The combination and coordination of such activities have the potential to achieve sustainable biofuel production and to demonstrate the kind of critical approaches that are essential to making sustainability operational in this and other energy sectors. © 2010 U.S. Government.",Perspectives on achieving sustainable energy production and use, ,journal of renewable and sustainable energy,79952596063,2010,,,,,,
"Catering for sustainability is often presented as a legitimate perspective for caterers to promote more equitable economic development locally and across distances through food procurement, integrated with environmental protection and concern for the welfare of customers and staff. Caterers are thus seen as agents responsible for sustainable food systems within their reach. This paper explores how public caterers use their position and productive intelligence in promoting a sustainable food system within the power field of their contextual networks. This article crystallises this 'agency for sustainability' as professional identity for sustainability, the shaping of which is analysed in Finnish public catering. The paper identifies eased and positive, troubled and critical as well as delimited and distancing approaches for sustainability, with respective views and efforts for sustainable food systems. The shaping of professional identity for sustainability could serve as co-operative platform for future contextual developments towards more sustainable food systems. Such progress could result in better alignment with political guidelines for sustainability and caterers' satisfaction due to their heightened professional position reaching beyond 'kitchen walls' to construct everyday sustainability.

"Reverse logistics, which is the management or return flow due to product recovery, goods return, or overstock, form a closed-loop supply chain. The success of the closed-loop supply chain depends on actions of both manufacturers and customers. Now, manufacturers require producing products which are easy for disassembly, reuse and remanufacturing owing to the law of environmental protection. On the other hand, the number of customers supporting environmental protection by delivering their used products to collection points is increasing. According to the findings, the total cost spent in reverse logistics is huge. In order to minimize the total reverse logistics cost and high utilization rate of collection points, selecting appropriate locations for collection points is critical in reverse logistics. This paper proposes a genetic algorithm to determine such locations in order to maximize the coverage of customers. Also, the use of RFID is suggested to count the quantities of collected items in collection points and send the signal to the central return center. This can facilitate the vehicle scheduling for transferring the items from collection points to the return center. The significance of this research is the proposal of RFID-based reverse logistics framework and optimization of locations of collection points which allow economically and ecologically reasonable recycling. Simulation results indicated that the genetic algorithm is able to produce good-quality solutions in terms of coverage of collection points by choosing suitable locations for collection points and RFID can help detect the quantity of returned products so as to increase efficiency of logistics operations.

"By the end of the eighties and at the beginning of the nineties, the companies encountered the lean wave. Apparently, in the ""first lean wave"" the companies neither succeeded in taking sustainable actions nor in achieving a comprehensive, value stream orientated improvement. The aim of establishing a culture of continuous enhancement failed also. The global competition of locations and the economic crisis are increasing the cost pressure and the necessity of streamlining the processes. The innovation of the ""second lean wave"" and the success factors are described in seven theses. Within these theses, the question of visualizing processes in order to enable optimal, robust and standardized solutions is emphasized. The times when the scope of optimization just included the flow of materials is over. By now indirect processes and global value streams are implied, too. Lean supply chains do request an optimization of networks and not only the notion of a supplier-plant-relation. Together with suppliers and service providers the supply chains have to be optimized on the base of partnership. Another leverage of lean management is the possibility to shift the problem identification and solution to the early periods of the innovation and development process (frontloading). The sequential product and process planning has to be removed. One of the crucial principles in the planning period is clearness. © Carl Hanser Verlag.",The second lean wave The Seven Theses, ,zwf zeitschrift fuer wirtschaftlichen fabrikbetrieb,65749111919,2009,,,,,,
"Purpose - Over the last decade, competition in the manufacturing sector has increased as globalization and customer requirements have evolved. Now, organizations are competing not only with their internal capabilities but also on their abilities to leverage capabilities in the supply chain. Recent studies suggest that strategic alignment in the supply chain, assessed by the degree of matching between supply management and market requirements, is critical for the success of organizations in the global marketplace. The purpose of this paper is to examine the possible linkage between strategic alignment (or lack of) in the supply chain, based on the traditional competitive priorities (i.e. cost, quality, flexibility and delivery), and the type of interactions with suppliers. Design/methodology/approach - Strategic alignment in the supply chain was measured by the difference between customer's requirements and the emphasis that the organization puts on these same requirements in dealing with its suppliers. The types of interactions were assessed by six items, three of them to measure the degree of arm's length practices and the other three to assess the degree of cooperation with suppliers. The empirical analysis used data from 512 manufacturing companies in Canada surveyed in 2003 and 2005. Linear regressions were conducted to test a series of four hypotheses linking alignment in the supply chain and the type of interactions with suppliers. Findings - Interactions with suppliers that are increasingly based on cooperation were found to be linked with a better alignment of competitive priorities that are characteristic of responsive supply chains. An unexpected result was the positive link between arm's length interactions and delivery, a dimension that is also associated with responsive supply chains. Research limitations/implications - The choice of interactions with suppliers can be critical in the alignment of competitive priorities in the supply chain.

"Purpose - The goal of this paper is to provide a broad foundation for future research in the are of strategic sourcing. Design/methodology/approach - The foundation is derived by drawing from various well-established organizational theories. Specifically, strategic sourcing was viewed from the perspective of institutional theory, resource dependence theory, network theory, systems, theory, resource/knowledge-based views of the firm, transaction cost economics, agency theory, strategic choice theory, sociocognitive theory, and critical theory. Findings - By viewing strategic sourcing through the lens of ten organizational theories, this research provides multiple insights into many interrelated strategic sourcing questions, such as when to make, buy or ally, how many and which suppliers, and how to manage sourcing relationships. The paper offers a rich and diverse foundation to foster future theory-building activities in sourcing and supply management research. Originality/value - While some of the se theory bases have been utilized, to some degree, in the supply management research, the paper offers a more holistic perspective of theoretical insights for strategic sourcing. Each of these organizational theories could be utilized as a foundation for future studies.

"This paper presents a new mathematical model for designing distribution networks in a supply chain system considering service level constraint optimizing strategic decisions (location), tactical decisions (inventory), and assigning decisions. In real-world cases, demand, traveling time or any parameters in classical models may change over the period of time. So, considering uncertainty yields more flexibility for the results and the proposed model. In our study, environmental uncertainty is described by discrete scenarios. In this model, we have service level constraint in order to prevent inventory lost in distribution centers (DCs). Also, we assume that customer's demand is stochastic with Poisson distribution function and DCs have coverage radius constraints thus any DC cannot service all the customers. In this model, location of DCs is selected and optimized and the best flow of products from supplier to DCs also from DCs to customers is determined. In this way, the customers' demand should be satisfied at least service level. To solve this nonlinear integer programming model we first present a new and robust solution based on a genetic search framework and then based on genetic algorithm results and some optimizer rules we propose a new heuristic method. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

"Reproducibility is a pillar of the scientific endeavour. We view computer simulations as laboratories for electronic experimentation and therefore as tools for science. Recent studies have addressed model reproduction and found it to be surprisingly difficult to replicate published findings. There have been enough failed simulation replications to raise the question, “can computer models be fully replicated?” This paper answers in the affirmative by reporting on a successful reproduction study using Mathematica, Repast and Swarm for the Beer Game supply chain model.

"Decentralized resource management is a promising field as it has the ability to lessen impact on Earth's climate change, assist with renewable technology development, increase equity in the distribution and consumption of resources, decrease vulnerability and enable participation of local people and businesses in the supply of technologies. Alternative energy and water resources are widely researched to provide self-sufficiency in scales of single houses to communities, but are still limited to demographical, technological, economical and social factors, which vary around the globe. Infra-Free (IF) is an academic research that seeks a synergy between relevant research fields to promote different decentralization scenarios for combined energy and water technologies with best-performance. The Infra-Free Motherboard (IF M ) is a proposal for a standardized platform, where installed technologies integrate within a household as robotic systems that evolve into a self-aware artificial platform to provide customized resource management. It addresses a multidirectional, real-time processing artificial resource management system that could develop its own skills by close interaction with the environment and the user. The system is enhanced with algorithms and dynamic systems to provide communication between different co-evolving systems that plug-in, adapt, evaluate and finally, customize themselves to dynamically changing environments due to resource availability, local needs, technology readiness and individual choices. The multidirectional real-time processing system further extends into a community application, where intelligent self-learning systems are aware of the amount and availability of resources in the whole network (community) and control the distribution between subsystems (houses) using best performance principles. Finally, this provides a dynamically transforming community that learns, adapts and redesigns itself. In this paper; at first, we introduce the standardized IF M and modular sub-system architecture. Next, we describe the hardware (platform) and software (self-learning process) architecture for the purpose to realize a customized real-time energy management system in a community of interconnected houses with a special focus on energy equation strategies. Next, we study a scenario to apply IF M in a small-scale community (100 people) in Masdar in 2012; integrated with a plug-in car concept, CO 2 recycle, evaporative cooling and Stirling engine system. Finally, we analyze the energy equalization potential of IF M in a computer simulation for a 6-household cluster (25 people).",Application of infra-free motherboard (IF <sup>M</sup> ) in a decentralized community for a customized real-time processing multidirectional energy supply network,Decentralization *** Infra-Free *** Integrated source management *** Intelligent design *** Real-time energy equalization,journal of asian architecture and building engineering,72049127290,2009,,,,,,
"The occurrence of emerging or newly identified contaminants in our water resources is of continued concern for the health and safety of consuming public. The existing conventional water treatment plants were not designed for these unidentified contaminants. The endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) comprise pharmaceuticals, personal care products, surfactants, various industrial additives and numerous chemicals purported to be endocrine disrupter. These have become a threat to our water supply network. The current wastewater treatment system is not effective in elimination of these different classes of emerging contaminants as these have not been monitored due to the absence of stringent regulation specific to these contaminants. These undesirable compounds are being released, knowingly or unknowingly, into the aquatic environment that affect the whole living organism. The paper discusses adverse effects of these emerging contaminants to water consumers and discusses the potential removal processes. The use of activated carbon, oxidation, activated sludge, nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes, and their efficiencies in removal of these pollutants, are reviewed. In particular, the nanofiltration removal mechanism is emphasized because of its utmost importance in eliminating micropollutants. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

"This paper investigates the dynamics of a complex adaptive supply network (CASN), focusing on understanding stability of the structural evolution of a supply network and supplier population emergence. Supply network evolution data collected from simulated responses of the U.S. automobile industry are used in multivariate statistics and time series analysis to identify patterns of network evolution. This analysis reveals that the type of environment a supply network evolves in appears to be a major factor in determining critical timing of structural changes during the evolution of a CASN. Further, time series analysis of firm population evolution highlights how supply networks evolve due to path dependencies in the CASN system. Information about these two aspects of supply network evolution can prove useful to a decision maker in determining how to respond to supply network changes. © 2009 Institute for Supply Management, Inc.™.",Investigating population and topological evolution in a complex adaptive supply network,Analysis of supply network evolution *** Complex adaptive supply network *** Logistical regression *** Supply network *** Time series analysis,journal of supply chain management,67651043907,2009,,,,,,
"Purpose – There is significant anecdotal evidence of increasing global supply chain fragility; and, for this reason, robustness and operational sustainability are of notable concern to senior executives. Though the issues are myriad, four factors dominate these concerns: increasing complexity of products, processes, and technologies, increasing structural complexity of supply chains, increasing diversity and global nature of business systems, and the environmental costs and impacts of extended supply chains. This paper aims to focus on these factors. Design/methodology/approach – This conceptual, theoretical paper differentiates corporate sustainability and operational robustness in terms of profitability and costs, then defines and develops internal, external, and uncontrollable fragility factors. A process that measures and integrates these factors is proposed for brainstorming and decision making. Additionally, methods to represent and compare alternatives, progress against internal or external targets, and industry goals or known competitor values are offered. Findings – This study describes and demonstrates an easy/to/implement process to address the potentially disastrous consequences of supply chain fragility. Practical implications – This study offers both academicians and practitioners a model to research, assess, and identify the risks and costs of current levels of supply chain fragility and to weigh various solutions. Originality/value – Unfortunately, few research efforts define these issues or identify the associated risks. Further, little has been put forward to posit, model, and facilitate the practical decision process to address these factor relationships. To these ends, the paper proposes a “fragility index” to help supply chain managers assess sources and potential costs of fragility, sustainability, and the associated environmental stress in their supply chains. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Weak links in the supply chain: Measuring fragility and sustainability,Risk management *** Supply chain management,journal of manufacturing technology management,84993099357,2009,,,,,,
"Sharing common resources is amongst critical factors creating competitive advantages in business and manufacturing. In today's competitive and dynamic environment, application of the resource sharing approach has become the focal point of attention for business managers. By resource sharing and through common platform guidelines, the possibility of producing an extended variety of products using the least variable production elements is provided. Meanwhile, today's manufacturing industries are trying hard to plan and manage an effective foundation for creating a value stream from the point of supplying resources to the stage of delivering the final product to the customer. Standardizing and sharing product components and common platforms is of great assistance to this effort.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to empirically assess the importance of knowledge management (KM) for sustainable development. Two main hypotheses about the critical success factors of knowledge and technology contribution to sustainable development are tested. Design/methodology/approach - The research is carried out using surveys and interviews among a KM/integrated information and communication technologies (IICTs) sustainable development community. Findings - Results show that KM is critical for innovation, prioritization and efficient use of resources. A significant linear association between IICTs and KM across time and geography is detected. IICTs improve the quality of shared decision making in inter- and intra-organizational settings. Paradoxically, IICTs lead to information overload, and digitization leads to knowledge dilution 'de-contextualization'. Nevertheless, these drawbacks are outweighed by the multitude of the converged technologies benefits. Research limitations/implications - There is a limited amount of data subjected to the statistical analysis. This may skew some of the results, and inflate the experimental error. However, the limited data are due to the restricted targeted population itself. Originality/value - The results in this paper led to the proposal of the knowledge iterative supply network (KISN) framework, which describes knowledge lifecycle that lessens technology negative impacts. This would be a valuable roadmap for KM practitioners who are planning to deploy KM technology for supporting sustainable development. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",An empirical assessment of knowledge management criticality for sustainable development,Communication technologies *** Communities *** Content management *** Sustainable development *** Working practices,journal of knowledge management,70350330325,2009,,,,,,
"Supply risk or the likelihood of supply disruptions is emerging as a key challenge to supply chain management. The ability to identify which supplier has greater potential of a disruption is a critical first step in managing the frequency and impact of these disruptions that often significantly impact on the supply chain. This paper presents preliminary research concepts regarding a new approach to the identification and prediction of supply risk. This approach to the assessment and classification of suppliers is based on supplier's attributes, performances and supply chain characteristics, while it is also modified by factors in the supplier's specific environment. The challenges posed to supply chains due to a turbulent environment (both from within the industry and external influences) are examined. A new method for the assessment and classification of suppliers based on their characteristics, performances and the environment of the industry in which they operate is presented. The findings are explained within the contingency theory. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"Competitive pressures are forcing companies to adopt practices and supply chain structures that will produce high quality, reliable, reasonably priced products with continuously shorter lead times. In order to meet these goals, companies are utilizing flatter organizational structures and narrower supply chains. Flatter structures and narrower supply chains typically reap the benefits of reduced coordination costs and improved organizational efficiencies. However, there exists an associated burden of an increased risk of a single point of failure that could leave the supply chain unable to deliver products to the market in a timely manner. This research study develops a model of risk, called the risk assessment index, to assess the vulnerability of different supply chain structures. It is determined that there exists significant trade-offs between the number of suppliers in the supplier base, product diversification, supply chain coordination, and supply chain efficiency that must be examined for a supply chain to remain competitive in a highly risky, vulnerable environment.",Mitigating supply chain vulnerability,Marketing channels *** Network design *** Risk *** Supply chain,journal of marketing channels,71049154098,2009,,,,,,
"Purpose: This paper aims to systematically document drivers of change and the implications they will have on international supply chain management in the coming two decades. Design/methodology/approach: This study was commissioned by the World Customs Organization (WCO) at the end of June 2006. Because of increased trade volumes, emerging complex supply networks and heightened security concerns, the WCO saw the need to assess future trends and drivers in supply chain management. The Delphi method was applied to identify a set of foreseeable drivers of change and to assess their predicted impact on global supply chain management in the coming ten to 20 years. Based on a literature review of 150 recent publications and interviews among 33 industry, academic and customs experts, a survey was designed and conducted to collect current and potential change drivers in global supply chains. These drivers were compiled and prioritized by an eclectic team of 12 specialists. Findings: The main results of the study are strongly connected to strategic and operational supply chain planning for the next ten to 20 years. They are related to increased off-shoring of operations through truly global manufacturing, characterized by its intercontinental supply of materials; increased product complexity with shorter product life cycles; increased importance of business-to-government networking for operational and security efficiency; introduction of new supply chain services integrating financial, physical and information flows leading to further consolidation in the logistics markets; and the overall increase in risks and vulnerabilities in international supply chains.

"The design and management of a multi-stage production-distribution system is one of the most critical problems in logistics and in facility management. Companies need to be able to evaluate and design different configurations for their logistic networks as quickly as possible. This means coordinating the entire supply chain effectively in order to minimize costs and simultaneously optimize facilities location, the allocation of customer demand to production/distribution centers, the inbound and outbound transportation activities, the product flows between production and/or warehousing facilities, the reverse logistics activities, etc. Full optimization of supply chain is achieved by integrating strategic, tactical, and operational decision-making in terms of the design, management, and control of activities. The cost-based and mixed-integer programming model presented in this study has been developed to support management in making the following decisions: the number of facilities (e.g. warehousing systems, distribution centers), the choice of their locations and the assignment of customer demand to them, and also incorporate tactical decisions regarding inventory control, production rates, and service-level determination in a stochastic environment. This paper presents an original model for the dynamic location-allocation problem with control of customer service level and safety stock optimization. An experimental analysis identifies the most critical factors affecting the logistics cost, and to finish, an industrial application is illustrated demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed optimization approach. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"One of the major challenges for product lifecycle management systems is the lack of integrated decision support tools to help decision-making with available information in collaborative enterprise networks. Uncertainties are inherent in such networks due to lack of perfect knowledge or conflicting information. In this paper, a robust decision support approach based on imprecise probabilities is proposed. Robust Bayesian belief networks with interval probabilities are used to estimate imprecise posterior probabilities in probabilistic inference. This generic approach is demonstrated with decision-makings in design for closed-loop supply chain. The ultimate goal of robust intelligent decision support systems is to enhance the effective use of information available in collaborative engineering environments.

"A preliminary study in comparative ecological network analysis was conducted to identify key assumptions and methodological challenges, test initial hypotheses and explore systemic and network structural characteristics for environmentally sustainable ecosystems. A nitrogen network for the U.S. beef supply chain - a small sub-network of the industrial food system analyzed as a pilot study - was constructed and compared to four non-human carbon and nitrogen trophic networks for the Chesapeake Bay and the Florida Everglades. These non-human food webs served as sustainable reference systems. Contrary to the main original hypothesis, the ""window of vitality"" and the number of network roles did not clearly differentiate between a human sub-network and the more complete non-human networks. The effective trophic level of humans (a partial estimate of trophic level based on the single food source of beef) was much higher (8.1) than any non-human species (maximum of 4.88). Network connectance, entropy, total dependency coefficients, trophic efficiencies and the ascendency to capacity ratio also indicated differences that serve as hypotheses for future tests on more comprehensive human food webs. The study elucidated important issues related to (1) the steady state assumption, which is more problematic for industrial human systems, (2) the absence or dearth of data on contributions of dead humans and human wastes to feed other species in an integrated food web, (3) the ambiguity of defining some industrial compartments as living versus non-living, and (4) challenges with constructing compartments and trophic transfers in industrial versus non-human food webs. The two main novel results are (1) the progress made toward adapting ecological network analysis (ENA) methodology for analysis of human food networks in industrial cultures and (2) characterizing the critical aspects of comparative ENA for understanding potential causes of the problems, and providing avenues for solutions, for environmental sustainability. Based on this work, construction and comparative network analysis of a more comprehensive industrial human food network seems warranted and likely to provide valuable insights for modifying structures of industrial food networks to be more like natural networks and more sustainable. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"The emerging paradigm of network competition is increasingly in evidence across many industrial sectors and provides further support for the idea that 'supply chains compete, not companies'. It can be argued that network competition requires a much greater focus on managing the interfaces that connect the individual players in that network and exchanging and leveraging knowledge across the network. This paper sets out to establish a framework whereby the critical interfaces and the knowledge sharing benefits can be identified and how the strength of the relationships at those interfaces can become the basis for building organisational reputation and create an environment more conducive to co-operation and knowledge sharing. Finally, the paper analyses the potential impact of reputational risks in influencing the perception of stakeholders about the organisation. Whilst the idea of value-adding networks based on closely connected providers of capabilities and resources is appealing, it should be recognised that, if not properly managed, the actions of the stakeholders in those networks can impact the risk profile of the business significantly-particularly reputational risk. The more that organisations become part of complex global networks, the more dependent they become upon the other network members for knowledge and other resources. Because of this dependency there is always the danger that the reputation of the focal firm can be damaged by the actions of other network members, hence reducing the likelihood of future collaborative working and knowledge exploitation. Using examples drawn from a variety of industries, the paper highlights the potential for reputational risk if the critical network interfaces are not closely managed. It will be argued that by actively managing relationships with stakeholders in the network the risk to the organisation's reputation can be mitigated and the sharing of knowledge simultaneously enhanced. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

"Sustainability strategies create many synergistic effects for SMEs working collaboratively, as well as systemic benefits for the commons. After setting forth the business case for sustainable SMEs, and considering SME sustainability advantages in contrast to MNEs, this paper discusses several different incentives for SMEs to optimize sustainability: (1) becoming valuable sustainable investment targets for larger firms; (2) creating highly competitive networks of sustainable SMEs in market spaces where large enterprises are less successful; (3) becoming highly efficient suppliers in global supply chains through sustainable practices. While several successful models of the sustainable SME are evolving, it may be that networks of SMEs will become essential for addressing the systemic problems that underlie industrial ecology, enterprise resilience, and global supply chain sustainability.

"Agent-based simulation, advanced planning and scheduling, lumber supply chain. Recent developments in supply chain planning have emerged from the field of agent technology and distributed decision making. Although several attempts have been made to exploit agent technology to design supply chain simulation tools, the integration of simulation with distributed supply chain planning tools is still a challenge. This paper aims at investigating this aspect of supply chain planning simulation through the use of theoretical contributions found in the field of simulation, systems theory, distributed decision making and agent-based software engineering. More specifically, this paper first proposes a conceptual framework for modeling ""distributed agent-based Advanced Planning and Scheduling"" (d-APS). Next, derived from this framework, it proposes some specific methods for understanding and modeling simulation problems at the initial phase of the modeling effort. This early phase is critical because it considerably influences the whole development process and the resulting simulation environment, but it is usually neglected in the concerned literature. Finally, a theoretical illustrative case is presented in the lumber supply chain.

"Purpose - Global supply chains are more risky than domestic supply chains due to numerous links interconnecting a wide network of firms. These links are prone to disruptions, bankruptcies, breakdowns, macroeconomic and political changes, and disasters leading to higher risks and making risk management difficult. The purpose of this paper is to explore the phenomenon of risk management and risk management strategies in global supply chains. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is based on an extensive literature review and a qualitative study comprising 14 in-depth interviews and a focus group meeting with senior supply chain executives. Findings - The study provides insights into the applicability of six risk management strategies with respect to environmental conditions and the role of three moderators. Research limitations/implications - The model is developed in a global manufacturing supply chain context. It should be tested in other contexts and with other methods to provide generalizability. The study takes a much needed step toward building a theory of risk management in global supply chains, which opens important future research directions. Practical implications - This research provides direction to managers for choosing risk management strategies based on the global supply chain environment. Moderators have practical implications for global supply chain managers. Originality/value - The paper addresses an identified gap in the literature for selecting risk management strategies in global supply chains.

"Outsourcing has been a very popular strategy in many industries to reduce production costs and allow companies to focus on their core competencies. Unfortunately, there are few models available in the literature that can aid management in the outsourcing decision. This paper presents a model that considers two critical characteristics relevant to the outsourcing decision-making process in manufacturing supply chains: failure costs due to not meeting the production requirements (resulting in lost orders and customers) and operating costs (including fixed costs associated with the management and control of the production stages, as well as the variable unit costs per production stage). The proposed model, motivated by the rapidly growing contract manufacturing environment in the pharmaceutical industry, determines the optimal manufacturing network consisting of in-house and Contract Manufacturers (CMs). The results demonstrate the sensitivity of the outsourcing decision to the reliability, cost of lost production and the replacement ability of the manufacturing network. Specifically, we show that when manufacturing network is unreliable parallel processing can result in lower total costs. Also, high failure costs results in redundant production and parallel processing.

"In today's global services outsourcing arena, increasing numbers of companies adopt multisourcing, that is, they select and combine information technology (IT) and business services from multiple providers. The literature on IT outsourcing and supply chain management has identified critical tradeoffs involved in increasing the number of suppliers and has strongly recommended focusing on a handful of strategic partners to balance these tradeoffs. Committing to a few strategic partners, however, may prevent a firm from discovering new suppliers, or even supply regions. Such missed opportunities may be particularly limiting in the context of offshoring professional services, which has exhibited rapid changes in supplier markets in the last decade. Thus, firms may want to engage in a more intensive multisourcing in services. If they do so, their success will depend on a global sourcing process that effectively addresses the critical tradeoffs involved. To explore how a global sourcing process can support multisourcing, we conducted a qualitative longitudinal case study of a large financial services institution that developed a varied global supply base to obtain offshore professional services. Our analysis results in a theory that emphasizes (i) advantages of a multiple provider strategy in rapidly changing global supply markets; (ii) the critical role of middle managers in enabling continuous innovation in the supplier structure; and (iii) the importance of the global sourcing process combining top-down and bottom-up decision making in multisourcing.",Global multisourcing strategy: The emergence of a supplier portfolio in services offshoring, ,decision sciences,WOS:000258266100009,2008,,,,,,
"During the 20th century, American agriculture underwent dramatic changes. At the beginning, farms were more diverse, dependent on animal traction, on-farm inputs and income and, after initial land grants, nearly independent of government policy. However. external issues. such as government policies, mechanization, fossil fuel costs, increased consolidation and vertical integration of markets and increased societal awareness of the environment and concern with farming practices, have Substantially altered the structure of agriculture. These external issues are significant drivers of agriculture and we grouped them into social/political, economic. environmental and technological drivers. Previous papers have examined specific effects of these drivers. Our objective is to examine how these drivers interact and influence today's agricultural systems. We developed four categories: (1) Commodity Crop Production. (2) Supply Chain Livestock Production, (3) Organic Production and (4) Extensive Livestock Production. to describe major current agricultural systems. These categories were developed as major and contrasting systems but do not represent all of American agriculture. Although it is not possible to predict the future, interactions among the various drivers will affect these systems differently. By examining multiple scenarios, We conclude the highly specialized systems (Nos. 1 and 2) are highly Vulnerable to future changes, and that developing adaptive capacity is critical for dealing with new uncertainty. Sustainable agricultural systems will need balance among various domains to be able to adapt and survive. We suggest that the concept of dynamic-integrated agricultural systems may he the best way to meet this goal because of its ability to consider multiple goals and flexible producer decision-making.","Interactions in integrated US agricultural systems: The past, present and future",dynamic-integrated production systems *** economic drivers *** social/political drivers *** environmental drivers *** technological drivers *** system adaptability,renewable agriculture and food systems,WOS:000261898500007,2008,,,,,,
"Background: International initiatives such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the President's Malaria Initiative have significantly increased availability and access to medicines in some parts of the developing world. Despite this, however, skills remain limited on quantifying needs for medications and ordering, receiving and storing medications appropriately; recording medications inventories accurately; distributing medications for use appropriately; and advising patients on how to use medications appropriately. The Regional Technical Resource Collaboration for Pharmaceutical Management (RTRC) has been established to help address the problem of skills shortage in pharmaceutical management in East Africa. Methods: The initiative brings together academic institutions from four East African countries to participate in skills-building activities in pharmaceutical supply management. The initiative targeted the institutions' ability to conduct assessments of pharmaceutical supply management systems and to develop and implement effective skills-building programmes for pharmaceutical supply chain management. Results: Over a two-year period, the RTRC succeeded in conducting assessments of pharmaceutical supply management systems and practices in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. In 2006, the RTRC participated in a materials-development workshop in Kampala, Uganda, and contributed to the development of comprehensive HIV/AIDS pharmaceutical management training materials; these materials are now widely available in all four countries. In Tanzania and Uganda the RTRC has been involved with the training of health care workers in HIV/AIDS pharmaceutical management. In Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda the RTRC has been conducting operations research to find solutions to their countries' skills-shortage problems. Some of the interventions tested include applying and evaluating the effectiveness of a novel skills-building approach for pharmaceutical supply management. Conclusion: Nurturing collaboration between regional institutions in resource-limited countries to build in-country skills in pharmaceutical supply management appears to be an effective intervention. Support from local programmes and technical assistance from organizations and institutions with the necessary expertise is critical for success, particularly at inception. The skills acquired by local institutions can be incorporated into both pre-service and in-service teaching curricula. This ensures long-term availability of skills in-country. The ability of trained institutions to mobilize their own resources for skills-building activities is crucial for the success and sustainability of these programmes.",A strategy to improve skills in pharmaceutical supply management in East Africa: the regional technical resource collaboration for pharmaceutical management, ,human resources for health,WOS:000265121400001,2008,,,,,,
"To avert risk, today's companies perform business with little capital investment. They invest only on the core activities which gain higher profit and outsource non-critical production activities to their partner companies (subcontractors or sourcing companies). Hence, a customer order is normally completed by a collaborative production network formed by the partner companies. However, co-ordinating those loosely and distributed companies to meet the uncertain demands from the final customers is not simple. This research suggests an order confirmation mechanism that allows synchronizing the available capacities over the supply network. The mechanism is developed based on a factory agent system and a design of three protocols: (1) protocol for normal condition, (2) protocol for abnormal condition, and (3) protocol for cancellation. Based on the protocols, messages and procedures are designed. The design is also deployed on a distributed computing environment to illustrate the feasibility and applicability.",Order confirmation mechanism for collaborative production networks,Agent-based manufacturing systems *** Communication protocols *** Distributed production planning *** Order Management *** Product production structure,international journal of production research,36248943462,2008,,,,,,
"In the first part of this paper, a general framework for modelling a fresh-food supply chain and an optimisation methodology to improve the performances of the network while preserving the quality of the product have been presented. The proposed modelling and optimisation framework explicitly considers the presence of uncertainty in the behaviour of the chain, providing solutions that are robust with respect to possible perturbations. The performance is improved by optimising the values of the physical and the logistic parameters describing the supply chain. The objective of this second part is to illustrate and to test the proposed approach on a real-world case study, concerning a beef meat refrigeration and distribution chain. After a model development phase, optimisation is carried out with the aim to reduce costs while guaranteeing both correct meat refrigeration and delivery due dates. The numerical solutions provided by the proposed algorithm are discussed and their robustness with respect to uncertainty is evaluated. © 2007 IAgrE.","Optimisation of fresh-food supply chains in uncertain environments, Part II: A case study", ,biosystems engineering,39149137184,2008,,,,,,
"Reverse auctions in business-to-business (B2B) exchanges provide numerous benefits to participants. Arguably the most notable benefit is that of lowered prices driven by increased competition in such auctions. The competition between sellers in reverse auctions has been analyzed using a game-theoretic framework and equilibria have been established for several scenarios. One finding of note is that, in a setting in which sellers can meet total demand with the highest-bidding seller being able to sell only a fraction of the total capacity, the sellers resort to a mixed-strategy equilibrium. Although price randomization in industrial bidding is an accepted norm, one might argue that in reality managers do not utilize advanced game theory calculations in placing bids. More likely, managers adopt simple learning strategies. In this situation, it remains an open question as to whether the bid prices converge to the theoretical equilibrium over time. To address this question, we model reverse-auction bidding behavior by artificial agents as both two-player and n-player games in a simulation environment. The agents begin the game with a minimal understanding of the environment but over time analyze wins and losses for use in determining future bids. To test for convergence, the agents explore the price space and exploit prices where profits are higher, given varying cost and capacity scenarios. In the two-player case, the agents do indeed converge toward the theoretical equilibrium. The n-player case provides results that reinforce our understanding of the theoretical equilibria. These results are promising enough to further consider the use of artificial learning mechanisms in reverse auctions and other electronic market transactions, especially as more sophisticated mechanisms are developed to tackle real-life complexities. We also develop the analytical results when one agent does not behave strategically while the other agent does and show that our simulations for this environment also result in convergence toward the theoretical equilibrium. Because the nature of the best response in the new setting is very different (pure strategy as opposed to mixed), it indicates the robustness of the devised algorithm. The use of artificial agents can also overcome the limitations in rationality demonstrated by human managers. The results thus have interesting implications for designing artificial agents in automating bid responses for large numbers of bids where human intervention might not always be possible. © 2008, Decision Sciences Institute.",Reverse auctions with multiple reinforcement learning agents,B2B e-Commerce *** Strategic decision making *** Supply chain-information systems interface,decision sciences,41549103804,2008,,,,,,
"Planning and Scheduling are the interrelated manufacturing functions and should be solved simultaneously to achieve the real motives of integration in manufacturing. In this paper, we have addressed the advanced integrated planning and scheduling problem in a rapidly changing environment, where the selection of outsourcing machine/operation, meeting the customers (single or multiple) due date, minimizing the makespan are the main objectives while satisfying several technological constraints. We developed a mixed integer programming model for integrated planning and scheduling across the outsourcing supply chain and showed how such models can be used to make strategic decisions. It is a computationally complex and mathematically intractable problem to solve. In this paper, a Chaos-based fast Tabu-simulated annealing (CFTSA) incorporating the features of SA, Tabu and Chaos theory is proposed and applied to solve a large number of problems with increased complexity. In CFTSA algorithm, five types of perturbation schemes are developed and Cauchy probability function is used to escape from local minima and achieve the optimal/near optimal solution in a lesser number of iterations. An intensive comparative study shows the robustness of proposed algorithm. Percentage Heuristic gap is used to show the effectiveness and two ANOVA analyses are carried out to show the consistency and accuracy of the proposed approach.",Modeling the planning and scheduling across the outsourcing supply chain: A Chaos-based fast Tabu-SA approach,Makespan *** Outsourcing *** Planning and scheduling *** Supply chain *** Tabu search and simulated annealing,international journal of production research,42649105820,2008,,,,,,
"Workforce capacity planning in human resource management is a critical and essential component of the services supply chain management. In this paper, we consider the planning problem of transferring, hiring, or firing employees among different departments or branches of an organization under an environment of uncertain workforce demands and turnover, with the objective of minimizing the expected cost over a finite planning horizon. We model the problem as a multistage stochastic program and propose a successive convex approximation method which solves the problem in stages and iteratively. An advantage of the method is that it can handle problems of large size where normally solving the problems by equivalent deterministic linear programs is considered to be computationally infeasible. Numerical experiments indicate that solutions obtained by the proposed method have expected costs near optimal. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

"The risks to water-supply systems from natural hazards has been determined up to now, if at all, only from the overlaps between risk zones and the distribution system. This article presents an innovative method of quantifying the vulnerability of water supply systems. This provides, for each component, determination of the impact of its potential failure on the overall system. System vulnerability is calculated by use of the software tool VulNetWS (Vulnerability of Water Supply Networks) developed by Unit of Environmental Engineering domain of University Innsbruck. Application of this method in a supraregional Alpine case study has shown that 0.42km2 out of the 21.375km2 study area exhibits some risk potential and this justifies detailed study. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Assessing the risk of natural hazards to water-supply systems on the basis of system vulnerability, ,osterreichische wasser- und abfallwirtschaft,56049116725,2008,,,,,,

"Reverse supply chains for the reuse, recycling, and disposal of goods are globalizing. This article critically reviews the environmental, economic, and social issues associated with international reuse and recycling of personal computers. Computers and other e-waste are often exported for reuse and recycling abroad. On the environmental side, our analysis suggests that the risk of leaching of toxic materials in computers from well-managed sanitary landfills is very small. On the other hand, there is an increasing body of scientific evidence that the environmental impacts of informal recycling in developing countries are serious. On the basis of existing evidence informal recycling is the most pressing environmental issue associated with e-waste. Socially, used markets abroad improve access to information technology by making low-priced computers available. Economically, the reuse and recycling sector provides employment. Existing policies efforts to manage e-waste focus on mandating domestic recycling systems and reducing toxic content of processes. We argue that existing policy directions will mitigate but not solve the problem of the environmental impacts of informal recycling. There are many opportunities yet to be explored to develop policies and technologies for reuse/recycling systems which are environmentally safe, encourage reuse of computers, and provide jobs. © 2008 American Chemical Society.","Environmental, social, and economic implications of global reuse and recycling of personal computers", ,environmental science and technology,50849103336,2008,,,,,,
"Transitioning to more sustainable operations is widely considered to be among the premier challenges facing the chemical industry today. The motivators for such change include an increasingly tightening regulatory regime, increased consumer awareness, and inclination of investors to consider risks associated with lendings to hazardous material industries. As an effort to become ""greener"", chemical industries are making conscious efforts to reduce their resource intensities or footprints. Such efforts need to be supported by models that can quantify the broad economic and environmental implications of industrial decisions. This manuscript uses the recently developed Ecologically Based Life Cycle Assessment (EcoLCA) model of the United States economy to analyze resource intensities of chemical industry sectors, comparing them with each other and with other industry sectors. The raw numbers are normalized by national flows to gain insight into possible resource vulnerabilities of industrial sectors. These numbers are also aggregated based on their mass or exergy to reduce their dimensionality and permit easier interpretation. Ecological cumulative exergy consumption (ECEC) allows consideration of a wide variety of ecosystem goods and services, human resources and emissions and their impacts on a consistent basis, and is shown to provide unique insight in addition to conventional measures based on mass and Industrial cumulative exergy consumption (ICEC). Ratios of ECEC to money indicate the relative throughputs of natural to economic capital, and are used for investigating supply chains of selected sectors and identifying likely keystone sectors. The insights obtained by juxtaposing resource intensities of chemical industry sectors amongst themselves and with those of the rest of economy are used to identify opportunities for reducing resources intensities of chemical industry sectors that could enable improvement of their environmental sustainability. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

"Recent economic and international threats to western industries have encouraged companies to increase their performance in all ways possible. Many look to deal quickly with disturbances, reduce inventory, and exchange information promptly throughout the supply chain. In other words they want to become more agile. To reach this objective it is critical for planning systems to present planning strategies adapted to the different contexts, to attain better performances. Due to consolidation, the development of integrated supply chains and the use of inter-organizational information systems have increased business interdependencies and in turn the need for increased collaboration to deal with disturbance in a synchronized way. Thus, agility and synchronization in supply chains are critical to maintain overall performance. In order to develop tools to increase the agility of the supply chain and to promote the collaborative management of such disturbances, agent-based technology takes advantage of the ability of agents to make autonomous decisions in a distributed network through the use of advanced collaboration mechanisms. Moreover, because of the highly instable and dynamic environment of today's supply chains, planning agents must handle multiple problem solving approaches. This paper proposes a Multi-behavior planning agent model using different planning strategies when decisions are supported by a distributed planning system. The implementation of this solution is realized through the FOR@C experimental agent-based platform, dedicated to supply chain planning for the lumber industry. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

"Avian influenza viruses are now widely recognized as important threats to agricultural biosecurity and public health, and as the potential source for pandemic human influenza viruses. Human infections with avian influenza viruses have been reported from Asia (H5N1, H5N2, H9N2), Africa (H5N1, H10N7), Europe (H7N7, H7N3, H7N2), and North America (H7N3, H7N2, H11N9). Direct and indirect public health risks from avian influenzas are not restricted to the highly pathogenic H5N1 ""bird flu"" virus, and include low pathogenic as well as high pathogenic strains of other avian influenza virus subtypes, e. g., H1N1, H7N2, H7N3, H7N7, and H9N2. Research has shown that the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic was caused by an H1N1 influenza virus of avian origins, and during the past decade, fatal human disease and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed among persons infected with H5N1 and H7N7 avian influenza viruses. Our ability to accurately assess and map the potential economic and public health risks associated with avian influenza outbreaks is currently constrained by uncertainties regarding key aspects of the ecology and epidemiology of avian influenza viruses in birds and humans, and the mechanisms by which highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses are transmitted between and among wild birds, domestic poultry, mammals, and humans. Key factors needing further investigation from a risk management perspective include identification of the driving forces behind the emergence and persistence of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses within poultry populations, and a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms regulating transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses between industrial poultry farms and backyard poultry flocks. More information is needed regarding the extent to which migratory bird populations to contribute to the transnational and transcontinental spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, and the potential for wild bird populations to serve as reservoirs for highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. There are still uncertainties regarding the epidemiological and ecological mechanisms that regulate ""spill-over"" and ""spill-back"" transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses between poultry and wild bird populations, and the interspecies transmission of avian influenza from infected birds to humans and other species of mammals. Further investigations are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of poultry vaccination programs for the control and eradication of avian influenza in poultry populations at the national and regional level, and the effect of long term poultry vaccination programs on human public health risks from avian influenza viruses. There is a need to determine risk factors associated with the extent of direct human involvement in the spread and proliferation of avian influenza viruses through commercial supply chain and transportation networks, and specific risk factors associated with domestic and international trade in live poultry, captive wild birds, poultry food products, (meat, eggs), poultry by-products (feathers, poultry meal), poultry manure, and poultry litter. Addressing these issues will greatly enhance our ability to implement economically and ecologically sustainable programs for the control of avian influenza outbreaks in wild and domesticated birds, increase our capability for promoting the protection of wild bird populations from disease and disruption, and help improve food security and public health in countries worldwide.",Public health and epidemiological considerations for avian influenza risk mapping and risk assessment,Avian influenza *** Biosecurity *** Epidemiology *** Geographic distribution *** Health *** Risk assessment *** Risk mapping,ecology and society,58749106300,2008,,,,,,
"© Emerald Group Publishing Limited. Purpose - The purpose of this study is to use current literature in conjunction with the insights from a detailed analysis of current practice to clarify and extend the knowledge of networks of clusters. Design/methodology/approach - This research is an exploratory study of cluster formation and global competitiveness. By applying cluster and network theory, this study examines critical elements of high-technology networks and clusters. A case study of two clusters in Taiwan and two in China reveals both intra- and inter-cluster network relationships. Findings - This research concludes that networks of clusters do exist and they carry potential advantages for both firms’ and clusters’ competitive advantage and innovation. Close network relationships and interdependences of industrial clusters have contributed significantly to the competitiveness of high-technology clusters in the Asia-Pacific region. Research limitations/implications - Further research is needed to determine what conditions best promote inter-cluster networks and when such networks are likely to generate the most value. Practical implications - First, the relationship among firms in an industrial cluster may be viewed as not only extended supply chains but also as more complex network forms. Firms in a cluster may work together to co-evolve for the purpose of enhancing competitiveness. This process is worthy of further attention from managers looking to more rapidly develop the competitiveness of their firms. Second, the industrial clusters offer a relatively favorable environment that allows the participating firms to more easily pool the resources, investments, and synergies necessary for them to become competitive in the global arena. Third, to the extent that specialization may increase comparative advantage, an industrial cluster can concentrate firms and industries in a region dedicated to a particular product or competence. Finally, once a cluster successfully pools the resources and develops the core products and competences, the phenomena of networks of clusters is likely to emerge for participating parties to share complementarities across both national and geographical boundaries. Originality/value - Most studies on high-technology clusters are focused on intra-cluster interaction. This study broadens the scope of analysis to explore the inter-cluster network structure that enhances global competitiveness of both firms and clusters in an effective and efficient manner. This study offers initial empirical evidences and a number of important insights to assist managers and policy makers in enhancing global competitive advantage.",Strategic development of network clusters: A study of high technology regional development and global competitiveness,Cluster analysis *** Competitive strategy *** International business *** Organizational theory,competitiveness review,77049115534,2008,,,,,,

"This paper considers the problem of coordinating the production and distribution activities of a network of independent supply centers. In particular, we focus on the supply of rapidly perishable goods (ready-mixed concrete) that must be delivered to customers in strict time windows. The problem presents three main challenges. First, it includes several interrelated scheduling and routing problems, each affected by nearly prohibitive combinatorial complexity. Second, due to the perishable nature of the supplied products, effective solutions must not only optimize the objective function related to resource utilization and cost minimization, but also tolerate the small and frequent stochastic perturbations (transport delays) of the operating environment. Third, if major perturbations occur, the decision strategy must be able to respond in real time with effective rescheduling interventions restoring the indispensable synchronization of activities in progress, and avoiding extremely undesirable circumstances related to product decay. After providing a detailed mathematical model of the considered problem, this paper proposes a hybrid metaheuristic approach integrating a genetic algorithm with a number of problem-specific constructive heuristics. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated against other scheduling heuristics on an industrial case study. Note to Practitioners-This research work focuses on a challenging rescheduling problem related to the production and distribution of rapidly perishable goods. The approach presented in the paper aims at achieving a compromise between four fundamental issues (quality of solution, search time, robustness to perturbations, and transparency of the decision algorithm) that cannot be easily obtained with general-purpose solvers proposed to practitioners. The presented algorithm integrates three tools (a mathematical programming model, a genetic algorithm, and a set of constructive heuristics) in a global metaheuristic rescheduling algorithm. The approach does not provide guarantees about the closeness to optimality of the solutions, but gives interesting results on numerical experiments based on two large-scale industrial case studies. Although the presented rescheduling method is tailored for a specific just-in-time supply problem, it may be profitably extended to a number of similar production and distribution problems by redefining the model constraints and objectives, and adapting the reconstructive heuristics accordingly.",Reactive scheduling of a distributed network for the supply of perishable products,activity coordination *** genetic algorithms (GAs) *** rescheduling *** supply networks,ieee transactions on automation science and engineering,WOS:000247832500010,2007,,,,,,
"The schedule for manufacturing and its delivery should be strategically determined to maintain economic and sustainable management of a supply chain. However, most of existing design models for the supply chain assumes that it is known or pre-specified when products are manufactured and delivered, and therefore, only the amount of products and delivery are of interest to optimize within design frameworks. In order to provide high flexibility and cost-effectiveness in manufacturing and supply chain activities, both timing information (i.e., when to produce and deliver) and capacity (i.e., how much to produce and deliver) need to be considered simultaneously. New MILP (mixed integer linear programming) model for the design and optimization of the supply chain has been proposed, in which these two key decision variables are simultaneously optimized. For dealing with computational difficulties resulted from the large-size problem, a sequentially-updating procedure is also proposed. In this sequentially-updating procedure, the whole distribution network is divided into subsystems and optimized interactively within iterative procedure, where each subsystem is sequentially optimized until no profit improvement is observed. The enhanced flexibility of the supply chain can be obtained from this improved design philosophy. This also ensures reliable and robust responsiveness of the supply chain to customers' demand without sacrificing efficiency and/or cost-effectiveness of manufacturing and delivery activities. Illustrated case studies show that the proposed method is able to deal with large and complex supply chain problems with significant cost savings.",Optimization for intelligent operation of supply chains,supply chain *** optimization *** operation *** flexible schedule,chemical engineering research & design,WOS:000252415900006,2007,,,,,,
"Recent years have witnessed a proliferation of food labelling schemes that claim to promote sustainable forms of food production. Viewed as a process of reterritorialisation or, more specifically, ecological localisation, such initiatives potentially provide constructive tools to re-address some of the environmental problems connected with agricultural restructuring and to re-organise production and consumption relations in the food system. This paper first examines the approaches and motives behind 24 food labelling schemes in selected European countries. It then uses this empirical material to conceptualise two development rationales: 'territorial' (place-based) and 'critical' (process-based). The rationales are explored through a comparative assessment of two Dutch case studies - Waterland and Milieukeur strawberries. The paper argues that producer involvement requires a clear economic incentive and that most food labelling schemes need significant institutional support if participation in more sustainable modes of production is to be fully realised.",Marketing sustainable food production in europe: Case study evidence from two dutch labelling schemes,sustainable production *** reterritorialisation *** food labelling *** Europe *** Dutch case studies *** development rationales,tijdschrift voor economische en sociale geografie,WOS:000249200300008,2007,,,,,,
"Many businesses fail to recognize the strategic importance of sourcing decisions. Companies often focus on the price and quality of goods provided to them, but it is easy to overlook the social and environmental standards of suppliers. Those who do may find themselves on the receiving end of aggressive attacks from a range of stakeholders, from customers and shareholders to the news media. Indeed, the business practices of Georgia Pacific, a hardwood plywood supplier, were at the heart of actions by the Rainforest Action Network aimed at disrupting operations at Home Depot; the practices of tomato growers that supplied Taco Bell restaurants were behind boycotts of the fast food giant; and fishing practices that endangered dolphins were the source of discontent with the tuna industry. Clearly the business practices of key suppliers can readily tarnish a corporate reputation, and the strategic impact - potentially including business disruption, business interruption, and even business failure - of neglecting these perceptions needs to be recognized by present and future business leaders. In order to examine the dynamics of change brought about as a result of negative stakeholder perceptions of supply management practices, we looked at the college and university athletic apparel industry, which between 1996 and 2001 came under scrutiny for dealing with suppliers and supply chains that produced goods in foreign factories with poor working conditions. When negative reactions escalated, the universities became the focus of activities aimed at changing the practices of their suppliers. This conflict was played out in the media, providing a solid approach - through discourse analysis - to investigating the events and reactions on both sides of the conflict. Our findings show that inattention to the practices of an organization's suppliers should serve to caution business leadership. Conversely, we show that a proactive stance toward managing supplier practices can serve to provide for successful resolution of stakeholder concerns regarding an organization's outsourcing.

"Purpose The purpose of this research paper is to offer a solution to differentiate supply chain planning for products with different demand features and in different life-cycle phases. Design/methodology/approach A normative framework for selecting a planning approach was developed based on a literature review of supply chain differentiation and supply chain planning. Explorative mini-cases from three companies – Vaisala, Mattel, Inc. and Zara – were investigated to identify the features of their innovative planning solutions. The selection framework was applied to the case company's new business unit dealing with a product portfolio of highly innovative products as well as commodity items. Findings The need for planning differentiation is essential for companies with large product portfolios operating in volatile markets. The complexity of market, channel and supply networks makes supply chain planning more intricate. The case company provides an example of using the framework for rough segmentation to differentiate planning. Research limitations/implications The paper widens Fisher's supply chain selection framework to consider the aspects of planning. Practical implications Despite substantial resources being used, planning results are often not reliable or consistent enough to ensure cost efficiency and adequate customer service. Therefore there is a need for management to critically consider current planning solutions.

"Purpose - The purpose of this research paper is to present a performance measurement system for enterprise networks (PMS-EN) developed within the context of a European project's context. Design/methodology/approach - This research follows a constructivist approach, based on the following activities: recompilation, analysis and study of scientific knowledge, acquisition of main postulates and construction of initial framework. Findings - This paper describes a performance measurement system called PMS-EN that can be used for managing performance in the enterprise networks context. After analysing different frameworks relating to such a thematic, and once their main weaknesses were identified, it was decided to develop a PMS that will overcome these difficulties and, at the same time, provide enterprises operating within these environments, with a simple, efficient, robust and useful framework. Research limitations/implications - This PMS has been built upon the framework called PMS IE-GIP, but thought could be given to building it upon other frameworks existing within the literature. Practical implications - Even though this proposal has been successfully applied to an enterprises network, it should be tested further by implementing it to other enterprises networks, with the main objective of enriching and extending it to other sectors. Originality/value - This paper has described a new performance measurement system called PMS-EN that can be used for managing performance in the enterprise networks context. It provides enterprises operating in this context a simple, efficient, robust and useful framework. Additionally, it is an efficient and effective tool for creating, managing and monitoring performance measures, in an analytical and graphical way, at both global and individual levels of the enterprise networks, which is lacking in most of the existing frameworks. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Performance measurement system for enterprise networks,Organizational structures *** Performance management systems *** Performance measures *** Supply chain management,international journal of productivity and performance management,34247389229,2007,,,,,,
"Timber scarcity relates to the evolution of stocks in both natural forests and tree plantations, relative to the demand from timber processing industries. Several economic indicators are used to evaluate timber scarcity. In particular, the market price of timber stumpage is believed to send a signal to investors in timber growing and to further regulate mill investments, thus preventing industrial overcapacities from emerging relative to future available wood supply. Our analysis of the Indonesian Pulp and Paper industry, one that expanded impressively in the 1990's and installed large overcapacities, gives us the elements to discuss the applicability of market price as a scarcity signal. Specific conditions, usually found in the developing world, most importantly weak or compromised public governance, flawed corporate governance, and the monopsony character of wood supply mechanisms, prevent the development of a market price scarcity signal. In this paper, special attention is paid to the complexity of the wood supply chain and the nature of the actors involved. This, together with the absence of pricing transparency, allows industrial overcapacities to occur, leading to the depletion of the natural forest. A key unresolved mystery here is why the private capital providers made no effort to detect this obvious and critical risk to the repayment capacity of their investments. The apparent absence of any government role in enforcing sustainable harvest or capacity levels results from state capture and governance failure, topics fully discussed elsewhere in the Indonesian case. The situation has implications for supply modeling as well as for public and private policies. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

"Knowledge is an increasingly significant factor of production in modern agriculture. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) can accelerate agricultural development by facilitating knowledge management. Based on an evaluation of several ICT initiatives in rural India, a framework to guide policy and implementation of ICTs in Indian agriculture is proposed. In this framework, agricultural development is visualized from two perspectives, a rural incomes and livelihoods perspective at the farm level, and a sustainability perspective at the regional level. The implementation of ICTs is proposed in three unique institutional environments: (i) closed vertical supply chain network for agribusiness enterprises, (ii) an open chain network with dynamically evolving partners and supply chain situations for the public, non-governmental and multilateral organizations, and (iii) a spatial data services network to address natural resources management and sustainability concerns. Each environment is assessed to identify its appropriate business models centered around ICTs, required technologies, scope for up-scaling the models, and required institutional and policy initiatives. In the future, as ICT infrastructure grows and connectivity and hardware costs decline, the critical constraints are likely to be the development of appropriate policy and institutional environments for the creation and delivery of information and knowledge to the end users. Significant policy, institutional networking and capacity building initiatives will be required at various levels to overcome the constraints and effectively integrate ICTs into the agricultural development process in India. © 2006.",A framework for implementing information and communication technologies in agricultural development in India,Agriculture *** Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) *** Rural incomes *** Sustainable development,technological forecasting and social change,34147109233,2007,,,,,,
"Using a supply chain network, we demonstrate the feasibility, viability, and robustness of applying machine learning and genetic algorithms to respectively model, understand, and optimize such data intensive environments. Deployment of these algorithms, which learn from and optimize data, can obviate the need to perform more complex, expensive, and time consuming design of experiments (DOE), which usually disrupt system operations. We apply and compare the behavior and performance of the proposed machine learning algorithms to that obtained via DOE in a simulated Vendor Managed Replenishment system, developed for an actual firm. The results show that the models resulting from the proposed algorithms had strong explanatory and predictive power, comparable to that of DOE. The optimal system settings and profit were also similar to that obtained from DOE. The virtues of using machine learning and evolutionary algorithms to model and optimize data rich environments thus seem promising because they are automatic, involving little human intervention and expertise. We believe and are exploring how they can be made adaptive to improve parameter estimates with increasing data, as well as seamlessly detecting system (and therefore model) changes, thus being capable of recursively updating and reoptimizing a modified or new model. © 2006.",Modeling and optimizing a vendor managed replenishment system using machine learning and genetic algorithms,Decision support systems *** Genetic algorithms *** Machine learning *** Supply chain management *** Support vector machines,european journal of operational research,33846369793,2007,,,,,,
"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to show that a proactive sourcing strategy can be just as important as a proactive marketing strategy in achieving sustainable competitive advantage. Design/methodology/approach The paper reports on action research carried out in the UK beef industry, with a focus on the food service supply chain. The methodology is inductive and qualitative, using a multi-case, multi-site approach. The supply chains presented in the case were analysed from farm gate to consumer, interviewing multiple participants at each stage of the supply chain. Findings This study offers some partial support for configuration-based approaches. However, the case also raises some doubts about the validity of configuration thinking, as it is not the complexity or ambiguity of the relationships that is key in the case, but the fact that brand ownership and contracts create property rights for their owner that create a relatively permanent power resource for Pioneer, the case study company, in its market struggle with its customers and competitors. This interpretation supports the power and property rights views of strategic management rather than the configuration approach. Research limitations/implications The research is based upon in-depth knowledge of the UK beef and red meat industry. It would be beneficial if further in-depth studies could be undertaken in other agri-food supply chains to further validate the findings. Practical implications Although the focus of this article has been upon choosing appropriate sourcing strategies, the case study has also illustrated the importance for business managers of linking this sourcing strategy with a firm's marketing, and more specifically its branding strategy. Originality/value The paper analyses the key differences in demand, supply and power and leverage characteristics in the food service beef supply chain to highlight the need for government agencies, think-tanks and industry participants to have a more robust understanding of industries before advocating the adoption of any one approach for all UK agri-food supply chains. This paper should be of value to researchers in this area and to managers responsible for strategy formation in UK agri-food supply chains. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",The proactive alignment of sourcing with marketing and branding strategies: A food service case,Agriculture *** Branding *** Meat *** Sourcing *** Supply chain management *** United Kingdom,supply chain management: an international journal,34548421130,2007,,,,,,
"Environmental awareness and legislative pressures have made manufacturers responsible for the take-back and end-of-life treatment of their products. To competitively exploit these products, one option is to incorporate used components in ""new"" or remanufactured products. However, this option is partly limited by a firm's ability to assess the reliability of used components. A comprehensive two-step approach is proposed. The first stage phase statistically analyzes the behavior of components for reuse. A well-known reliability assessment method, the Weibull analysis, is applied to the time-to-failure data to assess the mean life of components. In the second phase, the degradation and condition monitoring data are analyzed by developing an artificial neural network (ANN) model. The advantages of this approach over traditional approaches employing multiple regression analysis are highlighted with empirical data from a consumer product. Finally, the Weibull analysis and the ANN model are then integrated to assess the remaining useful life of components for reuse. This is a critical advance in sustainable management of supply chains since it allows for a better understanding of not only service requirements of product, but the remaining life in a product and hence its suitability for reuse or remanufacture. Future work should assess: (1) reduction in downtime of process equipment through the implementation of this technique as a means to better manage preventative maintenance; (2) reduce field failure of remanufactured product; (3) selling-service strategy through implementation of the proposed methodology. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

"It is widely accepted that firms play an important stewardship role in addressing sustainable development concerns. A key challenge in this role is to balance the often conflicting pressures created by sustainable development-firm-level economic performance versus environmental degradation and social disruption. Drawing on complexity theory, risk management, stakeholder theory and the innovation dynamics literature, we discuss the problems of integrating sustainable development concerns in the supply chain, specifically the applicability of life cycle assessment (LCA). Many authors have emphasized the importance of the ""cradle to grave"" approach of LCA in optimizing closed-loop supply chains, improving product design and stewardship. Based on two case studies (an agricultural biotechnology and an oil and gas company) with supporting data collected from key stakeholders, we argue that sustainable development pressures have increased complexities and presented ambiguous challenges that many current environmental management techniques cannot adequately address. We provide a framework that addresses these deficiencies and discuss implications for practitioners and management theory. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

"Supplier networks and the buyer/supplier relationships that comprise them are becoming increasingly important to effective supply chain management. Trust, collaboration, and efficient sharing of information are critical for true win/win relationships to surface in an environment where there is constant pressure to reduce costs and still maintain reasonable profitability. The use of across-the-board cost reduction demands and simple market clout may not always be the most effective approach in the long run. This paper describes linear performance pricing (LPP), a tool developed for a major automobile OEM in an attempt to effectively and efficiently provide more focused supply cost reductions. LPP is a data-driven methodology relying on a series of regression analyses that McKinsey and Company [2006. Automotive and assembly glossary. 〈http://autoassembly.mckinsey.com/html/resources/glossary/1.asp〉 (accessed 15.01.06)] describes as a ""measurement tool that establishes a relationship between the value provided by a given part (performance) and its price."" We maintain that LPP facilitates a collaborative effort on the part of both the buyer and supplier and has the potential for leveraging the increased visibility of the buyer within the supplier network with respect to tier one or tier two suppliers. It helps by focusing cost reduction efforts of the tier one suppliers and provides lateral market visibility they may not have otherwise. Although widely used throughout the automotive industry in the US and Europe, little discussion of LPP is found in the literature. To promote a better understanding of LPP, we present a detailed example and discuss the managerial implications of the approach. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

"Due to legislative requirements, environmental concerns, and market image, the disposition of end-of-life e-scrap is attracting tremendous attention in many parts of the world today. Effective management of returned used product flows can have a great impact on the profitability and resulting financial viability of associated e-scrap reverse production systems. However, designing efficient e-scrap reverse production systems is complicated by the high degree of uncertainty surrounding several key factors. Very few examples of this complex design problem are documented in the academic literature. This paper contributes as analysis of a new, large-scale application that designs an infrastructure to process used televisions, monitors, and computer central pro- cessing units (CPUs) in the state of Georgia in the U.S. The case study employs a scenario-based robust optimization model for supporting strategic e-scrap reverse production infrastructure design decisions under uncertainty. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is used to maximize the system net profit for specified deterministic parameter values in each scenario, and then a min-max robust optimization methodology finds a robust solution for all of the scenarios.",Planning the e-scrap reverse production system under uncertainty in the state of Georgia: A case study,electronics recycling *** reverse production systems *** robust optimization,ieee transactions on electronics packaging manufacturing,WOS:000241217800002,2006,,,,,,
"The vendor selection problem (VSP) is a critical element of the numerous managerial decisions in the consideration of both outsourcing and integrated supply chain management. Many papers in the literature have dealt with VSPs from a multicriteria perspective, but few have looked into the implications of such decisions in a multiechelon supply chain with the explicit consideration of multiple time-phased demands. A new integrated supply chain model is proposed for a multiechelon supply chain. This model takes into account the usual cost objective and other important criteria in a multiechelon supply chain ranging from the most upstream suppliers' quality to end customers' satisfaction level through a large-scale multiobjective linear programme (MOLP). Furthermore, various Pareto optimal solutions can be graphically presented to facilitate decision making and negotiations with existing and potential suppliers.",Multiobjective vendor allocation in multiechelon inventory systems: a spreadsheet model,vendor selection problem *** suppliers' management *** multiobjective linear programming *** procurement *** multiechelon inventory systems,journal of the operational research society,WOS:000236707000009,2006,,,,,,
"Demand for alternative feedstocks for fuels, chemicals, and a range of commercial products has grown dramatically in the early years of the 21st century, driven by the high price of petroleum, government policy to promote alternatives and reduce dependence on foreign oil, and growing efforts to reduce net emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Ethanol production has more than tripled since 2000, with annual US production expected to exceed 7 billion gallons by 2007. Sales of biobased plastics are also expanding. The growing availability of economically competitive biobased alternatives to petroleum can be attributed in large part to advances in the production and processing of corn grain for industrial uses. Steady increases in corn yields made possible by agricultural biotechnology continue to expand the supply of available grainbased feedstock. Rapid advances in the field of industrial biotechnology are greatly enhancing the efficiency of ethanol production and making possible a range of new biobased polymers, plastics, and textiles from agricultural starting materials. In order to meet the US Department of Energy (DOE) goal of 60 million gallons of ethanol production and 30 percent displacement of petroleum by 2030, new feedstock sources will be required to supplement high-efficiency production from grain. A robust sustainable supply chain for cellulosic biomass from agricultural residues and dedicated energy crops will be needed within a few years.Nearly 1 billion dry tons of cellulosic biomass could be supplied by US agricultural lands in the form of crop residues and dedicated energy crops. A growing list of companies have announced intentions to begin construction of cellulosic biorefinerics. One challenge for the emerging cellulosic biomass industry is how to produce, harvest, and deliver this abundant feedstock to biorefineries in an economically and environmentally sustainable way. Corn stover and straw from cereals such as wheat and rice are the most likely cellulosic Feedstocks for commercial-scale production of ethanol in the near term, potentially supplying more than 200 million dry tons of feedstock annually within three to five years-enough to triple current ethanol production. Dedicated energy crops such as switchgrass will follow as a feedstock supplement once a market for cellulosic biomass develops further. Corn stover has the largest potential as a near-term biorefinery feedstock, given its high per-acre yields. Current cropping practices require that most or all stover remain on the field to maintain soil health. As biorefinery construction creates markets for crop residues, farmers will be more motivated to adopt practices that lead to economic and sustainable removal. An environmental and economic ""optimum"" removal will balance sufficient retention of residues to avoid erosion losses and maintain soil quality while using excess residue as biorefinery feedstocks. The impact of varying levels of stover and straw removal will depend considerably on local conditions and practices.Under a range of conditions, no-till cropping allows for substantially greater residue collection than current practice, enabling biorefinery siting in areas where suitable supplies are currently unavailable. Further evolution toward greater no-till cropping is needed in order to supply adequate feedstock while complying with erosion guidelines and maintaining soil quality. Lower operating costs and recent successes have spurred an increase in adoption of no-till, with 16 percent of wheat acreage and 20 percent of corn acreage now under no-till practice. However, no-till is not yet widely utilized in regions of the country with the greatest potential to supply biomass. Ultimately, growing demand for crop residues will likely prove a strong additional driver for the transition to more widespread no-till cropping. Once a market for agricultural residues develops, individual farmers or groups of farmers may elect to adopt no-till cropping to attract biorefineries to their area. Residue collection may also enable no-till cropping in wetter regions, such as the northern Com Belt, where excess residues currently hamper germination and reduce yields. While the economics depend on regional and local conditions, for those not currently practicing no-till, the benefits of converting may justiry the time to learn new methods and the $50,000-$100,000 investment in new planting equipment. For instance, a 1,000-acre farm could expect to recover the additional costs through revenue from residue sales in as little as two years. New markets that commoditize the environmental benefits of notill farming could provide even greater incentive to convert. Carbon credits for no-till transition currently sell for roughly $1 per acre on the voluntary Chicago Climate Exchange. If mandatory greenhouse gas limits are established in the United States, the carbon credit benefits of no-till adoption could exceed $10 per acre. In addition to economic benefits for farmers, sustainable production, and collection of agricultural residues has the potential to deliver substantial benefits for the environment, such as reduced runoff of soil and fertilizers. But the greatest environmental benefit may be to the global climate through reduced emissions of fossil carbon and enhanced sequestration of soil carbon. With no-till cropping, sustainable collection of 30 percent of current annual corn stover production would yield over 5 billion gallons of ethanol and reduce net US greenhouse gas emissions by 90 million to 150 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent annually, if burned as E85 fuel. This would more than offset the net annual growth in emissions from all sectors of the US economy experienced in 2004. To realize these benefits, additional infrastructure in collection, storage, and transportation is needed to supply biorefineries. Rail transport greatly reduces transportation costs relative to trucking, allowing for a much larger collection area. One-pass harvest, in which grain and residues are collected simultaneously, also offers strong opportunities to lower cost.To facilitate development of the infrastructure necessary for sustainable production and collection of cellulosic agricultural feed-stocks, and to achieve the DOE goal of 30 percent displacement of petroleum with renewable biobased feedstocks by 2030, the US Congress should consider adopting supportive policy measures in the 2007 Farm Bill, including: Funding for accelerated development and production of onepass harvesting equipment Development and distribution of simple-to-use soil carbon models to allow farmers to compute how much crop residue can be collected without degrading soil quality Assistance to farmers to encourage the transition to no-till cropping for biomass production Incentives for the development and expansion of short-line and regional rail networks Funding for demonstration projects to streamline collection, transport, and storage of cellulosic crop residue feedstocks Development of a system to monetize greenhouse gas credits generated by production of ethanol and other products from agricultural feedstocks Funding for programs to help farmers identify and grow the most suitable crops for both food production and cellulosic biomass production Cellulosic biomass from agricultural residues and dedicated energy crops represents a highly promising new source of feedstock material for the production of ethanol, renewable chemicals, and a range of commercial biobased products.

"Purpose - For manufacturing enterprises, today's business environment is characterised by globally dispersed supply and manufacturing networks. In addition, the level of variety in products continues to increase in almost all sectors. Greater understanding of the management of product variety in international operations is required. Aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach - A generic simulation model representing a multinational corporation (MNC) supply chain is used to investigate the impact on supply chain performance of increasing product variety in combination with supply lead-time and demand uncertainty in an international setting. The simulation focuses on the upstream activities of production planning, inbound supply and manufacturing. The structure and logic of the simulation model are based on insights obtained from an empirical study of real MNC supply networks. Findings - The study shows that increasing the level of product variety has a detrimental impact on supply chain performance. In the presence of supply lead-time and demand uncertainty, high levels of variety result in much longer flow times and much higher system inventory relative to more stable conditions. The impact is greatest when variety involves critical materials which are required early in the production process and that entail long set-up times. Research limitations/implications - The study could be extended to incorporate more advanced inventory control models, the inclusion of downstream activities, multiple manufacturing sites and multiple potential supply routes. Practical implications - Implications for the selection of suppliers and for inventory control policies are discussed in the context of international operations. The potential value of postponement strategies and the need in some cases for fundamental product and process redesign to mitigate the negative impacts of variety are highlighted. Originality/value - Managing product variety in the context of international operations has received very little attention to date in the research literature.

"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are appealing in obtaining fine-granular observations about the physical world. Due to the fact that WSNs are composed of a large number of low-cost and energy-constrained sensor nodes, along with the notorious time-varying and error-prone nature of wireless links, scalable, robust and energy-efficient data dissemination techniques are needed for the emerging WSN applications such as environment monitoring and surveillance. In this paper, we examine this emerging field from the point of view of supply chain management and propose a hybrid data dissemination framework for WSNs. In particular, for each sensing task, the whole sensor field is conceptually partitioned into several functional regions based on the supply chain management methodology. Different routing schemes are applied to different regions in order to provide better performance in terms of reliability and energy consumption. For this purpose, we also propose a novel zone flooding scheme, essentially a combination of conventional geometric routing and flooding techniques. Our hybrid data dissemination framework features low overhead, high reliability, good scalability and flexibility, and preferable energy efficiency. Detailed simulation studies are carried out to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our scheme.",A robust and energy-efficient data dissemination framework for wireless sensor networks,Flooding *** Routing *** Sensor networks *** Supply chain management,wireless networks,33745640554,2006,,,,,,
"This work fits into a wider research on supply chains concerned with the development and implementation of a Multi-Agent Tool Management System (MATMS) for automatic tool procurement in a supply network. The main purpose of the MATMS is the optimised management of CBN grinding wheels for nickel base alloy turbine blade fabrication while operating in a multiple-supplier network environment made uncertain by external tool manufacturers showing unreliable tool delivery time response. Emergent synthesis concepts for tool management are analysed and discussed, and the design and functioning of Flexible Tool Management Strategies (FTMS), founded on an emergent synthesis methodology based on neuro-fuzzy paradigms, is illustrated. The FTMS paradigms, integrated in the MATMS as domain specific problem solving functions of the agent responsible tool inventory sizing and control, are proposed as dependable and robust toll delivery time forecasting methods, founded on knowledge evolution, for the solution of this Class II synthesis problem. The evaluation and comparison of the FTMS performance is carried out with reference to real industrial cases of CBN grinding wheel tool management. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

"Fostering and maintaining a win-win relationship with suppliers and other supply chain partners is a daunting task. Various driving forces play a significant role in making this a reality. In this study, we first define the theoretical domain of strategic supply management. Based on an extensive literature review, we then identify the key driving forces that assist buyer firms in making their supply management strategic and successful. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the effect of these driving forces on strategic supply management and the effect of strategic supply management on buyer’s performance. The results provide empirical evidence to the fact that strategic supply management is driven by several critical factors including environmental uncertainty, customer focus, competitive priorities, top management support, information technology and supply network structure. However, uncertainty was not found to be a significant deterrent in the successful management of supply activities. Rather, it was a stepping-stone for preparedness among the supply chain partners. In general, the results of this study provide additional insights for practitioners and researchers in understanding the strategic management of the supply function. © 2005 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Driving forces of strategic supply management: a preliminary empirical investigation,driving forces *** firm performance *** strategic supply management,international journal of integrated supply management,84889771237,2005,,,,,,
"Purpose – This paper aims to report on findings of a cross-sector empirical study of the sources and drivers of supply chain vulnerability. Design/methodology/approach – The research was undertaken in accordance with the realist tradition. It begins with a descriptive exploratory stage involving an in-depth exploratory case study of aerospace industry supply chains, validated through in-depth interviews with managers representing other “critical sectors” of the UK economy. This is followed by an explanatory theoretical stage. The work is supported throughout with reference to relevant literature sources. Findings – The findings highlight the absence of any widespread understanding of the scope of and dynamic nature of the problem, which should be considered from multiple perspectives and at four levels of analysis: value stream/product or process; asset and infrastructure dependencies; organisations and inter-organisational networks; and social and natural environment. Research limitations/implications – The paper is normative rather than positive, so focuses on understanding why supply chains are vulnerable to disruption, rather than presenting itself as a prescription for management. The paper does not investigate academic definitions or existing taxonomies of risk. Practical implications – The work provides some useful insights for practising managers and policy makers.

"In today's growing complexity of global networks of supply chains and hypercompetitive business environments, firms are confronted with the need to manage supply chain activities across functions and between firms. While prior research has noted the benefits of collaboration between functional areas for enhanced supply chain performance, there is not yet empirical evidence on whether an orientation toward working collectively among different functions for a firm's supply chain could influence customer satisfaction and supply chain responsiveness. A structured questionnaire was administered to U.K.-based food service suppliers, and 112 usable mail responses were obtained. Measures supporting cross-functional orientation (CFO) were developed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, and hypotheses were tested via path analysis. The findings show that a CFO positively affects customer satisfaction and supply chain responsiveness. The length of Internet adoption was also found to play a critical role in enhancing CFO, through positive moderating relationships with customer satisfaction and supply chain responsiveness. © November 2005, by the Institute for Supply Management, Inc.™.",The influence of a firm's cross-functional orientation on supply chain performance, ,journal of supply chain management,27844539871,2005,,,,,,
"The last decades, advances in information technologies and increased competition have changed the business environment in the food and beverages industry, particularly in the European Union, which is characterised by the proliferation of small and medium enterprises. Many food companies are now aggressively focusing on logistics management as the last frontier to gain and sustain a competitive advantage. This study describes a model of intelligent food supply chain that improves efficiency within the supply chain. The aim of the paper is to demonstrate that agent technology can optimise food supply chains by (a) reviewing intelligent agents applications for supply chain optimisation and (b) illustrating how a multi-agent system can optimise performance of a beverage logistics network. Firstly, we review and synthesise existing applications in comparison to traditional and Internet-based technologies and critically evaluate agent technology applicability for supply chain management. We model the beer supply network to demonstrate that products can acquire intelligence to direct themselves throughout the distribution network. Optimisation agents can help solve specific problems of beverage supply: reduce inventories and lessen bullwhip effect, improve communication, and enable chain coordination without adverse risk sharing. Further, they gain a capability to be purchased and sold while in transit. Overviews of the supporting technologies that make such a supply chain a reality are fully discussed. In particular, optimisation agents have the characteristics of autonomous action, being proactive, reactive, and able to communicate. We demonstrate that agents enhance the flexibility, information visibility, and efficiency of the supply chain management. Suggestions and recommendations for further research are provided. Simulations of the agent-enabled supply optimisation can be used to benchmark for future research and development associated with building an optimisation agent. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

"Current research in interorganizational information systems (IOS) for B2B eCommerce tends to focus on the factors that lead to the intention to adopt these systems. One important factor is the IT capability of a network member in the supply chain, but the extant literature is silent on the nature of the link between this factor and the intention to adopt. This paper contributes to the research literature by a critical approach that examines in detail the structure, dynamics and complexity of the link between them. Based on the literature review we suggest six mediating factors between IT capability and its intention to increase the sophistication of its business-to-business integration (B2Bi).

"Purpose - The purpose of the present paper is to provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing relationships among economic actors interconnected through internet and constituting e-supply networks (e-SNs). Design/methodology/approach - At first the main factors characterizing e-SN pattern are identified (organizational structures, managerial criteria and critical activities), then two separate procedures are adopted for developing an integrated reference framework. The first based on the analysis of correlations among variables influencing the factors under investigation; the second based on the analysis of different types of physical and immaterial flows among actors involved in the e-SN. On the basis of such evidence an integrated global framework is proposed, which is then used to classify and describe some relevant literature-based case studies. Findings - On the basis of two newly introduced variables, namely the internal integration degree and the decision-making concentration degree, the framework identifies four sets of organizational structures, managerial criteria and critical activities, each one coherent with specific environmental contexts. Research limitations/implications - The framework is restricted to describing and classifying different typologies of e-SN. Practical implications - The framework may be useful for assessing if the typology of organizational structure, managerial criteria and critical activities adopted for the management of a specific e-SN, is coherent with e-SN business environment. It may also provide useful guidelines for managers and practitioners involved in e-SN design.

"Appreciating the reliance of industrial networks on natural capital is a necessary step toward their sustainable design and operation. However, most contemporary accounting techniques, including engineering economics, life cycle assessment, and full cost accounting, fail in this regard, as they take natural capital for granted and concentrate mainly on the economic aspects and emissions. The recently developed thermodynamic input-output analysis (TIOA) includes the contribution of ecological goods, ecosystem services, human resources, and impact of emissions in an economic input-output model. This paper uses TIOA to determine the throughputs of natural and economic capitals along industrial supply networks. The ratios of natural to economic capitals of economic sectors reveals a hierarchical organization of the U.S. economy wherein basic infrastructure industries are at the bottom and specialized value-added industries constitute the top. These results provide novel insight into the reliance of specific industrial sectors and supply chains on natural capital and the corresponding economic throughput. Such insight is useful for understanding the implications of corporate restructuring on industrial sustainability metrics and of outsourcing of business activities on outsourcer, outsourcee, and global sustainability. These implications are discussed from the standpoints of weak and strong sustainability paradigms.

I present a particular critique of ethical trade based on its embeddedness in corporate strategies and management systems. The ethical trading strategies of leading UK food and clothing retailers form the empirical focus of inquiry, and theories found in the literature on economic geography concerning corporate strategy and interfirm organisation are used to gain critical insight into the management systems used by these retailers when they attempt to put ethical trading principles into practice in their global supply chains. Variations are observed between retailers in terms of their commitment to ethical trade, which are shaped by issues of corporate culture, financial management, and corporate restructuring. Varying levels of commitment to ethical trading strategy are argued in turn to influence organisational approaches to social auditing in the supply chain. Three contrasting modes of organisation for ethical monitoring are suggested to be used by retail companies-the arm's-length approach, the coordinated approach, and the developmental approach-each of which holds contrasting implications for suppliers and workers at production sites. I argue that corporate approaches to ethical trade vary markedly and that these variations have the capacity to shape the regulation of tabour conditions at sites of export production.",Corporate strategy and the management of ethical trade: the case of the UK food and clothing retailers, ,environment and planning a-economy and space,WOS:000230677500002,2005,,,,,,
"Although one can eliminate human bias from scenario definitions when modeling supply chain networks by using a pure operations research approach, the resources, data, and time needed for this approach may prohibit its use in fast-paced business environments. Hewlett-Packard's (HP's) strategic planning and modeling (SPaM) team refined an approach using true optimization coupled with scenario analysis, selectively focused on the most critical parameters of the design equation, and used this approach to solve a complex supply chain design problem for HP's imaging and printing group. The clear and easily demonstrable results helped management to understand their derivation and act confidently.

"Increasingly heterogeneous markets, together with shorter product life cycles, are forcing many companies to simultaneously compete in the three domains of product, process, and supply chain. Dependencies among decisions across these domains make this competitive situation very complex. To address this complexity, three-dimensional concurrent engineering (3D-CE) has been suggested ([Fine, C.H., 1998. Clockspeed - Winning Industry Control in the Age of Temporary Advantage. Perseus Books, Reading, MA.]). Applying 3D-CE requires an operationalization of one of its core elements: the product architecture. In this paper, I develop a multi-dimensional framework that enables comprehensive product architecture assessments. The framework builds on existing product characteristic concepts such as component commonality, product platforms, and product modularity. The framework's utility is illustrated with two example products, showing how individual product architecture dimensions link decisions across different domains. This framework can be used to focus advice for product design on product architecture dimensions that are critical for a given operational strategy, to assess advantages and limitations of operational strategies in conjunction with given product architectures, or to develop dynamic capabilities such as planning effective product-operation strategy combinations. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

"With the fast development of information technology and the global market, collaboration between different functional units in a supply chain becomes one of the most critical factors for global companies to respond to rapid changes in customer needs and increase the efficiency of the whole supply chain. This supply chain environment requires a production-distribution planning system to enable the collaboration between production and distribution units more quickly and orderly. Generally, collaboration in a supply chain needs to resolve conflicts between two decentralised functional units, because each unit tries to locally minimise its own costs, not the overall supply chain costs. Also, there exists incomplete information sharing according to the information privacy of each functional unit. This paper proposes a decentralised production-distribution planning system using collaborative agents that can efficiently mediate the planning gaps between two decentralised planning functions: production and distribution. The validity of collaborative-agent model has been shown using some lemmas and numerical examples.",Decentralised production-distribution planning system using collaborative agents in supply chain network,Collaborative agent *** Decentralised planning *** Production-distribution planning *** Supply chain network,international journal of advanced manufacturing technology,11144314696,2005,,,,,,

"An expert group was established in 2001 representing various organisations and authorities responsible for primary production, food processing, the distribution and consumption of foodstuffs, food safety and availability, catering and extension services, nature conservation, research into environmental impacts, and the media. The aim was to strengthen networking and improve the stakeholder response to accidental radioactive contamination of rural areas through participation in the FARMING network project. A hypothetical contamination of a large milk-producing area provided a suitable framework for evaluation of actions ensuring clean feeding of dairy cows during grazing. The following year the group received a compilation of rural countermeasures and waste disposal methods, described by the STRATEGY project. The robust, uncomplicated approach of the evaluation meetings was fruitful and efficient, and the multidisciplinary group was capable of taking shared views on various measures after updating their knowledge together. High priority was given to measurements of radioactivity and the provision of information and advice to a wider audience. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

"This study proposes a model for the analysis and performance evaluation of e-supply chains (e-SCs), that are supply chains (SCs) in which actors are connected by Internet technologies. It is assumed that e-SC performances are influenced by the network organizational structures, by the criteria adopted to manage relationships among involved actors, and by the critical activities that the leading company performs. At first the variables influencing such factors are identified and the interdependencies among them are analysed to establish existing correlations. This, in turn, enables one to group the values of the influencing factors in four coherent sets which are consistent with different business environments, thus assuring the effectiveness and efficiency to the e-SC. The obtained reference model is then tested by applying it to literature-based case studies. The output of this model may be used to design totally new e-SCs or to redesign the existing ones, in both manufacturing and services industries.",Analysis and evaluation of e-supply chain performances,Electronics industry *** Modelling *** Organizational structures *** Performance management *** Supply chain management,industrial management and data systems,:9444278383,2004,,,,,,

The properties that encompass survivability from a topolgical perspective, called as survivability components includes robustness, responsiveness, flexibility, and adaptivity. An adaptive network restructure or reorganize its topology on the basis of environmental shifts for providing efficient performance.

"An important feature of many complex systems, both natural and artificial, is the structure and organization of their interaction networks with interesting properties. Such networks are found in a variety of applications such as in supply chain networks, computer and communication networks, metabolic networks, food webs, etc. Here, we present a theory of self-organization by evolutionary adaptation in which we show how the structure and organization of a network is related to the survival, or in general the performance, objectives of the system. We propose that a complex system optimizes its network structure in order to maximize its overall survival fitness which is composed of short- and long-term survival components. These in turn depend on three critical measures of the network, namely, efficiency, robustness and cost, and the environmental selection pressure. Fitness maximization by adaptation leads to the spontaneous emergence of optimal network structures, both power law and non-power law, of various topologies depending on the selection pressure. Using a graph theoretical case study, we show that when efficiency is paramount the ""star"" topology emerges and when robustness is important the ""circle"" topology is found. When efficiency and robustness requirements are both important to varying degrees, other classes of networks such as the ""hub"" emerge. This theory provides a general conceptual framework for integrating survival or performance objectives, environmental or selection pressure, evolutionary adaptation, optimization of performance measures and topological features in a single coherent formalism. Our assumptions and results are consistent with observations across a wide variety of applications. This framework lays the ground work for a novel approach to model, design and analyze complex networks, both natural and artificial, such as metabolic pathways, supply chains and communication networks. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

"Gravel pre-filters and slow sand filters are robust and reliable unit processes with the potential for broad small community application in the developing world as they are able to provide physical and microbiological treatment. A multi-stage system comprising gravel pre-filters, slow sand filters and terminal disinfection conforms with the multiple barrier concept in relation to pathogen removal. Employing upflow gravel pre-filters as a form of pre-treatment also considerably reduces the risk of the slow sand filter blocking as a result of the surface straining of particles present in the raw water. The performance of a multi-stage treatment system, comprising shallow upflow gravel pre-filters and fabric-enhanced slow sand filters, was investigated both in service and during cleaning operations in a UK-based research project. The pre-filters provided microbial and physical treatment capacity and attenuated peaks in the raw water to the benefit of the slow sand filter. The slow sand filter achieved high levels of pathogen removal in addition to providing further physical treatment. The novel raised floor configuration adopted for the upflow pre-filters enabled high cleaning efficiencies to be achieved by rapid draindown. In parallel with the research work, a multistage system was constructed at Nyabwishongwezi, Rwanda, to provide a supply for new communities settling in the northern section of the Akagera Game Park following the 1994 genocide and war. The Nyabwishongwezi Treatment Plant and Supply Network Project was promoted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Oxfam and Minitrape, Rwanda. It was constructed broadly in keeping with the advice given to the parties promoting the project by the Centre for Environmental Health Engineering (CEHE), University of Surrey, during research visits to Rwanda in the late 1990s. In October 2003, CEHE research staff visited Nyabwishongwezi to support the Rwandan organisation (the Regie) operating the multi-stage plant and distribution system.

"In today's accelerating world economy, the drive to cut costs continually and focus on core competencies has driven many to outsource some or all of their production. In this environment, improving supply chain execution and leveraging the supply base through effective supplier relationship management has become more critical than ever in achieving competitive advantage. It is found that the integration of customer relationship management (CRM) and supplier relationship management (SRM) to facilitate supply chain management in the areas of supplier selection using an artificial intelligence approach has become a promising solution for manufacturers to identify appropriate suppliers and trading partners to form a supply network on which they depend for products, services and distribution. In this paper, an intelligent supplier relationship management system (ISRMS) using hybrid case based reasoning (CBR) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) techniques to select and benchmark potential supplier is discussed. By using ISRMS in Honeywell Consumer Product (Hong Kong) Limited, the outsource cycle time from searching for potential suppliers to the allocation of order is greatly reduced.",An intelligent supplier relationship management system for selecting and benchmarking suppliers,Artificial neural network *** Case based reasoning *** Selection and benchmarking *** Supplier relationship *** Supply network,international journal of technology management,:0042432055,2003,,,,,,
"Today's automotive leadership faces harsh competitive truths. Six forces will have transformed the automotive world by 2008: (1) an imperative to create value for consumers and shareholders, faster; (2) further consolidation and scale (yet scale alone is not guarantee of success); (3) a greater need for production and process agility, to embrace technological breakthroughs in vehicle engineering; (4) the advent of new disruptive technology in vehicles, and in supply chains; (5) accelerated innovation of products and services; innovation is the differentiator; and (6) Increasing customer expectation of both choice and value. Success in the future will depend on adopting a model that is based on collaborative relationships with suppliers and others. Companies that can assemble the best supply communities and accelerate consumer-centric innovation faster than their competitor's network will be the winners. Collaborative product commerce (CPC) provides the framework under which multiple-company collaborative communities can flourish and deliver long term sustainable value. The transition to a collaborative model requires strategic leadership. The formation of new communities will not happen as a natural evolution from the lower forms of collaboration that currently exist. The benefits of CPC include: shorter cycle times, cost reductions, development of consumer-centric offerings. Six key steps to CPC are: (1) make collaboration the centerpiece of strategy: obtain a community of partners that excel in customer responsiveness, speed to market, and innovation; (2) anticipate the upcoming disruptive forces and create a collaborative response with key community partners rather than in isolation; (3) work with community partners to identify essential areas where collaboration can create a superior business model; (5) begin working with partners first on enhancing product development; (5) focus on core competencies and eliminate redundant processes; and (6) share value within the community.

"Contemporary data management in applications such as pervasive systems, Web-based supply chain management, data warehouses, and Web crawlers involve the periodic transcription of data onto secondary devices in a networked environment. In this paper, we focus on the scheduling of periodic data transcription in append-only environments, such as e-mail inboxes, newsgroups, technical support bulletin boards, or procurement requests. If the client connects to the server too frequently, the client will nearly always have up-to-date information, but the usage of network resources may be excessive. Conversely, very infrequent connections will conserve network resources, but the client's data may often be significantly out of date, which may also be costly (in terms of lost opportunities, for example). Thus, the best transcription policies should make on optimal trade-off between these costs. Our approach to evaluating this trade-off is to use modeling techniques from the field of stochastic processes. The paper presents a general model for data insertions on the server side, using compound nonhomogeneous Poisson processes, and compares several transcription policies in terms of both transcription cost and obsolescence cost. The comparisons use a validation data set from a real data feed, and our models were calibrated using a separate training set from the same feed. We find that transcription policies based on a nonhomogeneous Poisson arrival model often outperform simpler policies.",Scheduling of data transcription in periodically connected databases,poisson models *** information systems applications,stochastic analysis and applications,WOS:000185443900005,2003,,,,,,

Problem areas are identified together with various illustrations of good practice, with a particular stress on the necessity for intensive and effective informal communications. The particular problems attendant on the design side of the process, rooted in role confusion and a lack of design fixity are highlighted. This links to the suggestion that as the knowledge of Hybrid systems becomes better understood and is more fully communicated through codification then many of these problems should evaporate.

"This article addresses the transfer of new product technologies from outside the firm for integration into a new product system as part of a product development effort. Product technology transfer is a key activity in the complex process of new product development and is the fundamental link in the technology supply chain. Product technology transfer too often is dealt with in an ad-hoc fashion. Purposeful- management of the product technology transfer process leads to more effective transfers in terms of timeliness, cost, functional performance, and competence building. Better management of product technology transfer gives firms access to a greater variety of new technology options, improves a firm's ability to offer significantly differentiated products, deepens the firm's competitive competencies, and positively influences sustained product development success. The central objective of this article is to gain insight into product technology transfer so that companies can manage this process more successfully and so that researchers can investigate this critical activity further. This article describes the technology supply chain as a unique form of a supply chain that poses a set of managerial challenges and requirements distinguishing it from the more traditional component supply chain. Because a single product technology transfer project is the fundamental piece in the technology supply chain, understanding this piece well is key to leveraging the extended technology supply chain and to improving overall product development performance. This article integrates literatures on new product development, supply chain management, and technology management and builds on organizational theory to present a conceptual model of determinants of product technology transfer success. The core proposition is that product technology transfer effectiveness is greatest when companies carefully match (or ""fit"") the type of technology to be transferred (the ""technology uncertainty"") with the type of relationship between the technology supplier and recipient (the ""interorganizational interaction""). A quite detailed framework characterizing technology uncertainty along the dimensions of technology novelty, complexity, and tacitness is presented to help in assessing the challenges associated with transferring a particular product technology. This article also considers detailed elements characterizing the interorganizational interactions between the technology source and recipient firms. This helps firms consider the appropriate means to facilitate the inter firm process of technology transfer. Overall, this article provides practical insight into characterizing technologies and into improving the product technology transfer process. This article also provides a strong theoretical foundation to aid future research on product technology transfer in the technology supply chain.",Product technology transfer in the upstream supply chain, ,journal of product innovation management,:1542285905,2003,,,,,,

"Warehousing is becoming more and more a critical activity in the supply chain to outperform competitors on customer service, lead times, and costs. However, if warehousing is to be a source of competitive advantage, then the implementation of a warehouse management information system (WMS) is a necessary condition to achieve efficiently the high performance of warehousing operations required in today's marketplace. A major practical question is then whether a given warehouse should implement a standard or a tailor-made WMS. A standard WMS offers many advantages; it is a proven solution, it is less costly, the implementation lead time is shorter, and the after-sales service is better. On the other hand, a standard WMS remains largely making compromises between the way a warehouse wants to work and the way the system allows the warehouse to work. In certain environments, such compromises might seriously degrade warehouse performance, in which case it then seems better to implement a tailor-made WMS. To answer the above question, we conducted an exploratory field study of warehouses with recently implemented WMSs to first understand the empirical reality and then build up a theory linking the constructs warehouse complexity and warehouse planning and control structure. Warehouse complexity refers to the number and variety of items to be handled, the degree of their interaction, and the number, nature, i.e. technologies used, and variety of processes, determined among others by the warehouse's position in the logistic chain and the nature of its market. Warehouse planning and control structure refers to the management functions that plan, direct, coordinate and control the flow of goods through the warehouse, from the time of receiving to the time of shipping. It is strongly related to the WMS in use. We found that the number of orderlines to be processed per day and the number of stock-keeping units are the two main observable aspects of warehouse complexity; that the more complex the warehouse is, the more tailor-made the planning and control structure should be; that for simple warehouses a standardized planning and control structure suffices; and that the design of a new-to-build warehouse should be carried out in close concert with the design of the warehouse planning and control structure. © MCB UP Limited.",Linking warehouse complexity to warehouse planning and control structure: An exploratory study of the use of warehouse management information systems,Inventory control *** Management information systems *** Operations planning *** Warehousing,international journal of physical distribution and logistics management,11844305286,2002,,,,,,
"The Guadalhorce catchment is characterized by hydrological extremes, severe flooding which has intermittently devastated the coastal conurbation of Málaga and riparian settlements upstream and periodic droughts of several years' duration. The region is also affected locally by high levels of salinity in soils and water. Attempts to manage this situation to permit economic development through agriculture and industry over several centuries seemed to have ameliorated the worst excesses and during the 20th century a series of major dam projects offered the potential for sustainable future economic growth. However, rapid population growth and shifting patterns of agriculture have brought the question of sustainability back on to the agenda. This paper analyses the hydrological characteristics of the severe drought of the mid-1990s, in terms of its impacts both on water quantity and water quality in the region. The strategies adopted to maintain domestic and tourist water supplies in the face of high demands from irrigation, particularly looking at the conjunctive use of groundwater, and the development of regional water grids are evaluated. The pressures on water quality, which developed in various parts of the Guadalhorce hydrological system, including in the main water supply network for the city, are also explored. The paper concludes that the demands on the water supply system are unlikely to be manageable through current strategies and that ecological and water quality issues will probably prove more critical than water volumes in determining approaches to management of future droughts.

"Understanding industries in terms of the concepts of chains, clusters and networks is becoming increasingly important in economies around the world. Supply chain management for an individual organization is an emerging field of research in the construction management discipline, but less attention has been devoted to investigating the nature of the construction supply chains and their industrial organizational economic environment. This selected review of construction and mainstream management supply chain literature is organized around four themes; distribution, production, strategic procurement management and industrial organization economics, and highlights the need to develop an industrial organization economic supply chain framework for construction. The merging of the supply chain concept with the industrial organization model as a methodology for understanding firm conduct and industry structure and performance is an important contribution to both construction supply chain and construction economic theory. Much of the industrial organization supply chain literature has tended to focus upon manufacturing industries, where typically firms are permanent organizations. This raises issues as to the differences between industries founded upon temporary compared with permanent organizations. There is potential for the development of an industrial organization methodology applicable to the project based industry. Ultimately industrial organization research seeks to have direct implications for industry performance and government policies.",An industrial organization economic supply chain approach for the construction industry: A review,Construction industry *** Critical review *** Industrial organization economics *** Supply chain theory,construction management and economics,:0035576510,2001,,,,,,
"Supply chain management system (SCM) is an integrated network of suppliers, factories, warehouses, distribution centers and retailers, through which the whole chain of logistic processes is managed so that it should aim at a faster and more flexible co-ordination between a company and its customers and suppliers within the chain. Collaboration among the members of SCM plays a critical role to implement an effective SCM, but its implementation would not be easy only with the conventional information sharing mechanism. This study employs the idea of open tender concept with blackboard-based negotiation to develop a collaborative supply chain system. The open tender concept is designed to provide an open and free opportunity to all participants, which make a sound competition to obtain the tender. Blackboard-based negotiation is derived from the mechanism of negotiation among intelligent agents using a blackboard as a media where each agent exchange information. The study applies the idea to a parts/material supply system, which is designed to function as a part of SCM. For replenishment of parts/materials, a company issues a tender and publishes it to a public blackboard for information exchange via the Internet using electronic tender submission form to find appropriate suppliers. Candidate suppliers to the tender are invited to issue their quotations, which compete one another under an open environment and the most appropriate candidate is selected as a result of open competition.

"Agility and rime-based manufacturing are critical success factors for today's manufacturing enterprise. To be competitive, enterprises must integrate their supply chains more effectively and forge close memberships with customers and suppliers more quickly. Consequently, technologies must be developed that enable enterprises to respond to consumer demand more quickly, integrate with suppliers more effectively, adapt to market variations more efficiently and evolve product designs with manufacturing practices more seamlessly. The mission of the Extended-Enterprise Coalition for integrated Collaborative Manufacturing Systems coalition is to research, develop, and demonstrate technologies to enable the integration of manufacturing applications in a multi-company supply chain planning and execution environment. We believe real-time and asynchronous collaboration technology will play a critical role in allowing manufacturers to increase their supply chain agility.
