0,"© 2021, The Author(s). Knowledge of the interactions between soil systems, management practices, and climatic extremes are critical for prescription-based sustainable practices that reduce environmental pollution/footprints, disruption of food supply chains, food contamination, and thus improve socio-economic wellbeing. Soil quality status and dynamics under climate change present both a hazard which may not be remedied by simply adding chemicals or improved by crop varieties, and an opportunity (e.g., by indicating impact of a shift in land use) although the specifics remain debatable. This entry not only revisits the science of soil quality determination but also explicates on intricacies of monitoring using big data generated continuously and integrated using the “internet of things.” Indeed, relaying credible soil quality information especially for heterogeneous soils at field scale is constrained by challenges ranging from data artifacts and acquisition timing differences, vague baselines, validation challenges, scarcity of robust standard algorithms, and decision support tools. With the advent of digital technology, modern communication networks, and advancement in variable rate technologies (VRT), a new era has dawned for developing automated scalable and synthesized soil quality metrics. However, before digital technology becomes the routine tool for soil quality sensing and monitoring, there is need to understand the issues and concerns. This contribution not only exemplifies a unique application of digital technology to detect residue cover but also deliberates on the following questions: (1) is digital agriculture the missing link for integrating, understanding the interconnectivity, and ascertaining the provenance between soil quality, agronomic production, environmental health, and climate dynamics? and (2) what are the technological gaps?[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",10.1186/s40643-020-00359-x,Bioresources and Bioprocessing,Accuracy | Digital mapping | Soil quality | Spatial interpolation,85099049589,Digital technology dilemma: on unlocking the soil quality index conundrum,2021.0
1,"© 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers Beneficial to the environment but complex in nature, closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) has been understandably a topic of studies for a lot of researchers. However, most of the literature focuses on the homogeneity of CLSC products and on the dyadic structure of the CLSC mostly involving single manufacturers, distributors, or retailers. Very seldom do we find studies conducted in the analysis of the CLSC with network structure, in which multiple agents compete and coordinate. Inspired by some recent business cases, we develop a coupled CLSC network model dealing with heterogeneous products facing different market demands. The end-of-life product from the forward supply chain is collected and recycled so that raw material can be extracted and used as an input for the reverse supply chain which produces another type of product. Moreover, in each supply chain, raw material suppliers, manufactures, and retailers have to compete and coordinate to satisfy the demand while the forward and reverse supply chains have to work together to materialize the supply chain “loop”. Additionally, a CLSC network equilibrium is defined and studied by using variational inequalities. The properties of the equilibrium solution are also examined. By applying the modified projection method, we analyze a series of numerical examples. Based on the proposed model, the managerial insights are provided to show how the market size of the forward chain, raw material costs in both forward chain and reverse chain impact the demand, equilibrium prices and total profits of the CLSC network. It is also worth noting that the consumers' environmental awareness is critical to make the coupled CLSC networks viable.",10.1016/j.spc.2021.01.037,Sustainable Production and Consumption,Closed-loop supply chain | Heterogeneous demand | Network equilibrium | Network interaction | Variational inequality,85100463336,Closed-loop supply chain network with interaction of forward and reverse logistics,2021.0
2,"© 2021 Elsevier Ltd The increasing demand for a sustainable Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry has driven research domains integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM) with sustainability to gain momentum over the past years. While some studies have reviewed the development in these two domains separately, they did not address the important associations between them, nor did they analyze their joint advancement over time. Therefore, this study aims to understand and quantitatively analyze the dynamic evolution of relationships between BIM and sustainability critical towards developing BIM's functionalities to satisfy the industry's growing sustainability needs. First, 523 relevant journal articles published over the last 15 years were collected. Rule-based content analysis is then conducted on these articles using text mining to retrieve and structure relevant textual data pertaining to the six defined dimensions: BIM functionalities, software, sustainability aspects, green certification systems, project phases, and stakeholders. Social network theory is then applied to map and measure the associations between the dimensions' components for analyzing the dynamic changes in their synergies over three spans. Results reveal a significant transformation in the diversity, magnitude, and expansion of associations between BIM and sustainability domains across the supply chain. Findings also highlight less explored areas that require further research and industrial attention towards achieving full use of BIM and sustainability's integrated power. This work's novelty lies in comprehensively and quantitatively analyzing these often-dismissed synergies to reveal through knowledge-based findings how BIM has progressed to address the industry's changing sustainability requirements and recommend future directions for advancing sustainable BIM practices.",10.1016/j.jobe.2021.102159,Journal of Building Engineering,AEC | Building information modeling (BIM) | Built environment | Social network analysis | Sustainability | Text mining,85099231707,The dynamic evolution of synergies between BIM and sustainability: A text mining and network theory approach,2021.0

Blockchain is designed to ensure the data is stored and updated in a secure, tamper-proof and irreversible way. Despite being in its nascent stages, the blockchain research is developing rapidly in different fields, making it imperative to capture the ethical and sustainability implications of blockchain development and implementation. The circular economy also focuses on enhancing sustainability and social responsibility, alongside economic growth. In this article, we critically review blockchain technology's current and potential contribution to the circular economy through the lens of sustainability and social responsibility. This paper contributes to the Industry 4.0 literature by identifying, collating and organising the disparate research on blockchain, with a critical focus on its positive impact and potential repercussions for the ethics agenda. Within this narrative review, we argue and highlight the extant and potential alignment of blockchain with circular economy. Our findings show that blockchain technology can contribute to the circular economy by helping to reduce transaction costs, enhance performance and communication along the supply chain, ensure human rights protection, enhance healthcare patient confidentiality and welfare, and reduce carbon footprint. We also evaluate the challenges to blockchain implementation for circular economy, in terms of trust, illegal activities, potential for hacking and the need to address these through suitable legislation and policy development. Furthermore, we acknowledge the potential upfront costs involved in implementing blockchain technology, although we observe that the benefits are likely to exceed the challenges. We conclude this article with recommendations for future research in this field.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.126130,Journal of Cleaner Production,Blockchain | Circular economy | Industry 4.0 | Social responsibility | Sustainability,85100513657,Blockchain technology and the circular economy: Implications for sustainability and social responsibility,2021.0
4,"© 2020 Balancing sustainability and disruption of supply chains requires organizational ambidexterity. Sustainable supply chains prioritize efficiency and economies of scale and may not have sufficient redundancy to withstand disruptive events. There is a developing body of literature that attempts to reconcile these two aspects. This study gives a data-driven literature review of sustainable supply chain management trends toward ambidexterity and disruption. The critical review reveals temporal trends and geographic distribution of literature. A hybrid of data-driven analysis approach based on content and bibliometric analyses, fuzzy Delphi method, entropy weight method, and fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory is used on 273 keywords and 22 indicators obtained based on the experts’ evaluation. The most important indicators are identified as supply chain agility, supply chain coordination, supply chain finance, supply chain flexibility, supply chain resilience, and sustainability. The regions show different tendencies compared with others. Asia and Oceania, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Africa are the regions needs improvement, while Europe and North America show distinct apprehensions on supply chain network design. The main contribution of this review is the identification of the knowledge frontier, which then leads to a discussion of prospects for future studies and practical industry implementation.",10.1016/j.spc.2020.09.017,Sustainable Production and Consumption,Ambidexterity | Content analysis | Data driven | Disruption | Entropy weight method | Fuzzy decision-making trial and Evaluation laboratory | Fuzzy Delphi method | Sustainable supply chain management,85093665045,Sustainable supply chain management towards disruption and organizational ambidexterity: A data driven analysis,2021.0

The literature has presented a summary of the evolution of sustainable supply chain management across attributes. Prior studies have evaluated different parts of the supply chain as independent entities. An integrated systematic assessment is absent in the extant literature and makes it necessary to identify potential opportunities for research direction. A hybrid of data-driven analysis, the fuzzy Delphi method, the entropy weight method and fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory is adopted to address uncertainty and complexity. This study contributes to locating the boundary of fundamental knowledge to advance future research and support practical execution. Valuable direction is provided by reviewing the existing literature to identify the critical indicators that need further examination. The results show that big data, closed-loop supply chains, industry 4.0, policy, remanufacturing, and supply chain network design are the most important indicators of future trends and disputes.

6,"© 2021 This article describes and discusses nominated procurement as a means through which buyers select sub-suppliers to achieve sustainability compliance upstream in emerging economies' supply chains. Hence, it critically examines the ways buyers articulate nominated procurement and the unfolding supply chain consequences. Based on in-depth interviews and fieldwork in the Sri Lankan apparel supply chain, the findings indicate that buyers accomplish sustainability compliance among their sub-suppliers while prioritizing their own business agenda. In doing so, however, buyers perpetuate “suboptimal compliance” of raw material suppliers and “sandwiching” of direct suppliers as harmful consequences on the supply chain. These consequences link theoretically with commercial, geographical, compliance and extended-compliance pressure. This article contributes to the advancement of the Sustainable Supply Chain Management literature by theorizing about nominated procurement, direct and indirect pressure, and pointing to the supply chain consequences beyond achievements in sustainability compliance.",10.1016/j.jbusres.2021.01.040,Journal of Business Research,Business networks | Emerging economies | Nominated procurement | Sandwiching | Sustainability compliance | Sustainable Supply Chain Management,85100382982,Nominated procurement and the indirect control of nominated sub-suppliers: Evidence from the Sri Lankan apparel supply chain,2021.0
7,"© 2020 Elsevier Inc. Green closed-loop supply chain (GCLSC) is a supply chain that encompasses forward and reverse flows of components and products in logistic networks with a focus on economic and environmental performance. In the decision-making process of GCLSC, the presence of uncertainty and risk originating from the size and complexity of network is crucial to consider, and the distribution of uncertain parameter may be ambiguous. To characterize the ambiguity caused by distributional perturbation, a novel ambiguity distribution set is proposed, and further a new upside risk: upper partial moment with power q is introduced to quantify the economic risk in the GCLSC. Subsequently, a distributionally robust fuzzy GCLSC network design model which attempts to optimize the worst-case performance of the network is developed with the perspective of a trade-off between upside risk and expectation of economic cost. To format a sustainable GCLSC paradigm, the policy of carbon cap is adopted to control carbon emissions in terms of environmental constraints. Furthermore, the tractable counterpart of the proposed model is obtained by transforming distributionally robust credibility objective and constraints into their equivalent forms under ambiguous distribution of uncertain parameter. Finally, a case study on Coca-Cola Company in Northeast China is investigated to test and verify the proposed model. The advantage of proposed model is demonstrated through comparative study on distribution ambiguity free and without environmental constraint problem. Computational results reveal that the proposed model has superior capability of immunity against the risk of distribution ambiguity.",10.1016/j.apm.2020.10.042,Applied Mathematical Modelling,Ambiguity distribution set | Carbon emissions | Distributionally robust | Green closed-loop supply chain | Mixed-integer programming | Upper partial moment,85096650626,A novel robust fuzzy mean-UPM model for green closed-loop supply chain network design under distribution ambiguity,2021.0
8,"© 2021 Elsevier Ltd Addressing dual crisis of fossil fuels i.e. environmental as well as gradually decreasing reserves, design of a nationwide robust supply chain network based on bio-energy has been presented in this work. The four echelon supply chain caters the target of blending 20% bio fuels with conventional fuel during 2018–2026. The mixed integer linear programming model considers handling of multiple types of feed sources, products, transport options while performing the techno, economic and environmental analysis of the supply chain to optimally determine the operational and design decisions. The uncertainty in demand, import product price and biomass feed supply has been tackled using data driven robust optimization approach developed using fuzzy transcription of discontinuous uncertain parameter space using machine learning based unsupervised learning methods. To handle a ∼50% increase in overall biofuel demand over the nine-year planning horizon, the deterministic model shows a dynamically changing supply chain with a ∼20% increase in the newly added locations; however, the worst case robust optimization results are reported to be 6% leaner than the results obtained for the deterministic model.

Using text mining techniques on the content of the title, abstract, and author keywords of papers classified by the Web of Science as literature review studies in OR/MS, we found that there are 76 topical consolidated clusters in the field covering a wide range of reviewed topics. Since 2015, reviews on supply chain risk management and big data analytics have had the highest impact in the field, whereas topics such as Industry 4.0, socio-technical systems, social networks, green supply, sustainable supply chain, and resilience engineering have all received significant attention from researchers. Reviews on analytic hierarchy process were found to be the most impactful overall, showing the high relevance of multi-criteria decision making in the current research and practice contexts. Furthermore, a text mining analysis of the papers citing OR/MS literature reviews showed that optimization continues to be one of the most highly influential methodological contributions of OR/MS to other research areas and that topics such as circular economy, carbon emissions, and social commerce have yet to find some traction in OR/MS research, suggesting future research and multidisciplinary opportunities for the field. Results also show that the research area of Public Administration has been greatly influenced by OR/MS reviews as 16% of all the papers published in that field have cited at least one of the 1744 review papers included in this study.

10,"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd The closed-loop supply chain management (CLSCM) is an attractive research field for the corporate and academic worlds; however, closing the loop is not a simple task. Reverse logistics activities increase management complexities and uncertainties by establishing multi-fold collection and return management processes. Unlike traditional supply chain management, where managers deal with only stochastic demand, in closed-loop supply chain management, they deal with both stochastic demand and returns, which increases the cumulative uncertainty in the system. Firms usually use disposable packaging, and demand uncertainties also increase the negative environmental implications of logistics activities. This study aims to investigate optimal remanufacturing strategy and reusable packaging capacity under stochastic demand and return rate for single and multi-retailer closed-loop supply chain models. The results show that a hybrid policy is an optimal option for both single and multi-retailer cases; however, the rate of remanufacturing increases for multiple-retailers. Furthermore, remanufacturing cost, manufacturing cost, and ordering cost of retailers are the principal drivers of hybrid supply chain management. The results further suggest that supply chain managers should reduce manufacturing and remanufacturing costs because they play a central role in deciding the optimal remanufacturing rate. Increasing the remanufacturing rate increases ordering quantities and reduces setup and ordering costs in the system. Thus the remanufacturing is a relatively inexpensive policy for supply chains with higher setup and ordering costs. Numerical examples, sensitivity analysis, and comparative study show the robustness and validity of the proposed model.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.125609,Journal of Cleaner Production,Remanufacturing | Returnable transport items | Reverse logistics | Supply chain management | Sustainability,85099336981,Ramification of remanufacturing in a sustainable three-echelon closed-loop supply chain management for returnable products,2021.0

They have garnered significant attention due to their feature of creating secure private and public networks in a decentralized manner. The traditional FSC fails to meet the customer requirements of quality, safety, reliability, transparency, and traceability. This paper proposes a novel 3-stage methodology using principal component analysis (PCA), total iterative structural modeling (TISM), and Matrice d'Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée à un Classement (MICMAC) analysis to develop an integrated BC with the food supply chain (FSC). The existing literature was surveyed and industry experts' opinion was gathered and various critical success factors (CSF) were identified which are associated with FSC and BC. The data collected from experts were then evaluated for data consistency and dimension reduction through PCA. The dimensionally reduced data set was analyzed by TISM and MICMAC analysis. TISM and MICMAC analysis categorizes the enabler factors according to their hierarchical level and is used to label or distinguish between dependence and driving power. The integrated methodology found nine CSFs, namely, transparent system, fraud detect, inventory management with tracking, scalability, secure system, cost reduction, safe and quality food, customer satisfaction, and government regulations, which are the main drivers for the FSC business.

This paper investigates the two echelon supply chain network of the battery manufacturing industry. This deals with an integrated optimization procedure for solving the green transportation problem and inventory problem in the first echelon, and the capacitated multi depot (Distribution center/Collection center) heterogeneous green vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery in the second echelon. The minimization of the green objective function comprising inventory carrying cost, transportation cost and carbon emission cost are considered in this work. The focus of this paper is to formulate the problem in the Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming model and to solve the four problem instances (P1 – P4) using GAMS 23.5 and Simulated Annealing Algorithm (SAA) with swap neighbourhood solution method. The experimental results show that the integrated approach with SAA provides a better solution than the sequential approach. The robustness test is carried out with four typical problem instances which show that the proposed SAA provides near optimal solutions. The model analysis is demonstrated with different components of the objective function which will help the top management to take appropriate decisions in the context of cost savings. The performance comparison reveals that the proposed SAA (SAA-1) has given better results than the Simulated Annealing Algorithm with insertion method (SAA-2).",10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.125434,Journal of Cleaner Production,Green transportation | Green vehicle routing | Inventory | Multi period | Pickup and delivery | Two-echelon,85098456504,"Integrated optimization of transportation, inventory and vehicle routing with simultaneous pickup and delivery in two-echelon green supply chain network",2021.0

15,"© 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. Global warming has produced negative effects in all life aspects around the world. Particularly, in terms of agriculture, the rainfall variability causes lower water availability, having unfavorable yield effects in all the crops. Temperature increases and rainfall reduction have resulting decreases in agricultural production and infertility. These issues, combined with the constant population growth, predict a severe food security problem for the next decades. In recent years, natural disasters are more frequent and dangerous as the result of global warming. Droughts, freezing, and flooding are the problems with the highest impact on the food supply chain, particularly in low-income communities, increasing the lack of access to food and undernourished problems, resulting in human casualties. This paper presents a response analysis of the food supply chain network in 14 municipalities of the state of Michoacán in Mexico; these municipalities are the ones with the lowest human development index values, joined to malnutrition problems. Natural disasters such as freezing, flood, and drought were considered and used to measure their impact on the food network through a mathematic optimization model, obtaining food system behavior to these difficulties. In the addressed case study, as a consequence of natural disasters, the total cost of the food network increases fifteen times to obtain a resilient system.

Firstly, this introduces a bi-objective closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network by deliberating on farming of herbs and production plus distribution of associated herbal medicines in manufacturing-chain layer. Reverse-chain layer (RC-layer) recycles used substrates and unused herbs, thus producing biofuels and casing soil. Though majority of well-established CLSC models comprise sole pecuniary objective function, this aims to validates the economic self-reliance of RC-layer. Besides, Governments pay the subsidy to various entities, including the growers to encourage countrywide farming of herbs and the biofuels-plants for the extent of clean fuel produced. Thus, two different partners of same network earn subsidy without analysing trade-off. Secondly, this study develops an emended minmax method based interactive bi-objective optimization algorithm by employing absolute difference function and newly introduced semi-autonomized desired levels in real-life oriented T-environment. In pessimistic business scenario, whereas proposed model turns infeasible in classical interactive fuzzy multi-objective optimization algorithm, proposed algorithm determines corresponding Pareto optimal solution. In optimistic business scenario, optimal net profits to both layers of proposed model are more desirable than respective goals in proposed algorithm. Vulnerability analysis of twelve parameters to proposed model plus twelve subfigures pleads legislators to offer more subsidy to biofuels-plants and slightly lesser to growers; and to enact regulations to intensify the recycling of discarded substrates and herbs, thereby ensuring financial feasibility of RC-layer. Again, reduced subsidy to biofuels-plants and little more subsidy to growers, plus multi-angled modernization of all partners except landfills elevate the profitability of proposed network.",10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106949,Applied Soft Computing,Biofuels | Closed-loop supply chain | Interactive fuzzy minmax multi-objective optimization | Marketing | Production,85097466559,Cost-effective subsidy policy for growers and biofuels-plants in closed-loop supply chain of herbs and herbal medicines: An interactive bi-objective optimization in T-environment,2021.0

19,"© 2020 The use of renewable energies has become very attractive, because it protects the environment and boosts regional development. In this paper, a sustainable two-phase sequential approach is proposed for the design of bioenergy SCs under uncertainties. The first phase, integrating geographical information, social aspects, and multi-criteria decision-making techniques, helps find appropriate locations for the bio-refineries. High rates of unemployment, and high vulnerability to the variation in the markets in an economic crisis are considered as social concerns. Integrating these factors filters the areas for the second phase. The first phase reduces complexity in the computation of the problem, and helps set up sustainable development in the supply chain. In the second phase, to cope with the uncertainties in the bioenergy supply network, a robust model is introduced. It reduces the sensitivity to inaccurate input data, and the obtained solutions stay optimal when the parameters change slightly. In order to validate this two-phase sequential approach, a case study is investigated. The results of tests show that integrating the concepts of uncertainties and sustainability with geographical information of the area in a two-phase sequential approach outperforms the traditional models, and leads to the creation of 262 jobs. The jobs have a high impact on the surrounding area.",10.1016/j.compchemeng.2020.107131,Computers and Chemical Engineering,Bioenergy supply chains | Biomass | Decision aid | Geographical information | Optimization | Social sustainability | Sustainable development | Uncertainty,85096619441,A two-phase sequential approach to design bioenergy supply chains under uncertainty and social concerns,2021.0

However, many companies often have problems such as insufficient partner credit, which seriously affects the quality of cooperation. In order to effectively evaluate the credit, this paper constructs a personal credit evaluation model. The model compares the weight adjustment method with BP neural network and other methods.

22,"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd The devastating impact of the ripple effect increases the importance of the reverse supply chain (RSC) design to ensure sustainability in the long-term. That being the case, in this study, a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer optimization model is proposed to design an RSC network under uncertainty sourcing from the ripple effect (i.e. external side of RSC) by considering the environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability. The environmental and economic disruptions of the ripple effect are represented by the increase in the carbon emission levels and the distance of roads, and the decrease in the capacity of facilities, respectively. Accordingly, a set of scenarios is considered based on the disruption levels (low- and high-impact) in case of the ripple effect. Furthermore, an α-reliability constraint is integrated into the model to further analyze the occurrence of scenarios. The model allows us to make integrated operational and strategic decisions by placing an emphasis on the carbon emission levels (i.e. environmental dimension) and the total cost (i.e. economic dimension). To obtain some remarkable insights, the proposed model is validated through computational experiments based on data extracted from a real case. The computational results show that the ripple effect increases the emission level and total cost up to 40%. For this reason, it suggested that the regulations regarding WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) should be prepared by considering sustainability in the entire RSC network. Besides, it is realized that the centralized distribution strategy leads to a more resilient RSC network design.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.124548,Journal of Cleaner Production,Reverse supply chain (RSC) | Ripple effect | Two-stage stochastic optimization,85095741569,Ensuring sustainability in the reverse supply chain in case of the ripple effect: A two-stage stochastic optimization model,2021.0

Existing studies have identified critical sectors as either direct water users or food consumers indirectly driving upstream water uses. However, sectors acting as intermediate transmission centres in the virtual water network driven by final food demand are overlooked. Production efficiency improvement of these critical transmission sectors (i.e., using less upstream inputs to produce unitary output) could indirectly reduce water uses of the whole supply chains. Taking China as the case, this study identifies critical transmission sectors for food-water nexus at the provincial level, based on an environmentally-extended multi-regional input-output model and the concept of betweenness. Results show that the agricultural products sectors in Shandong, Heilongjiang, and Hubei are the top three transmission sectors. They transmit 4.6, 4.1, and 3.0 billion m3 of embodied water resources, respectively. Some important transmission sectors, such as the cotton in Xinjiang and chemical industry in Jiangsu, cannot be identified by production-based and consumption-based methods. Results also highlight the necessity of strengthening inter-regional and inter-sectoral cooperation, because partial critical transmission sectors are not located in the demand provinces.

Different from other oil and gas supply infrastructures, oil and gas pipelines may be more vulnerable to accidental, natural and intentional threats due to their widespread distribution. Therefore a systematic and thorough review is carried out to investigate safety and security of oil and gas pipelines based on bibliometric analysis. First, a total of 598 publications between 1970 and 2019 related to safety and security of oil and natural gas pipelines was retrieved and refined from the database of Web of Science (WoS). The 598 publications are analyzed by the bibliometric software VOSviewer to obtain the temporal and regional distribution of publications, to identify “productive institutions” and “productive authors”, and create the cooperation networks between institutions and authors. Besides, the evolution of research topics and research methods are identified based on keywords and bibliographic analysis. Moreover, the main research topics and research methods are analyzed to obtain insight into the research evolutions and trends. Risk assessment, leakage, and corrosion are the main topics while QRA, fuzzy theory and the Bayesian network are the most frequently used research methods. To further improve the sustainability of oil and gas pipelines, this study provides and discusses future research needs such as pipeline security, environmental sustainability, pipeline system resilience.

The telecommunication service firm cannot implement multiple improvement practices altogether to overcome the risk factors with limited resources. The industries should evalu-ate the relationship between risk factors and explore the determinants of improvement measures. The purpose of the present study is to identify and analyze critical risk factors (CRFs) for enhancing sustainable supply chain management practices in the Indian telecommunication industry using interpretive structural modelling (ISM). Risk factors are identified through a literature survey, and then with the help of experts, nine CRFs are identified using a fuzzy Delphi method (FDM). The relationship among these CRFs has been analyzed using ISM, and the driving and the dependence power of those CRFs are analyzed. Results indicate that both “government policies (laws and regulations)” and “the impact of rapid change in technology” are independent or key factors that affect the sustainability of the telecommunications supply chain. In addition, results provide significant managerial implications, including enhanced sustainability, and the government should build justice, fairness, open laws, certainties, and regulations to prevent risk in the telecommunications industry supply chain; service providers should monitor the rapidly evolving technologies and focus on technical learning and organizational capacity development to overcome the impact of technological changes. The contribution of this study is using a novel approach to establish a hierarchical structural model for an effective understanding of CRFs relationships and to explore decisive risk factors that can help telecom service providers to better plan and design effective improvement strategies to enhance sustainability supply chain management.",10.3390/su13020445,Sustainability (Switzerland),Critical risk factors (CRFs) | Fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) | Interpretive structural modelling (ISM) | Sustainability supply chain management | Telecommunications industry,85099155837,An exploration of the critical risk factors in sustainable telecom services: An analysis of indian telecom industries,2021.0

We seek to investigate the effectiveness of flexibility and redundancy in terms of minimising expected supply chain cost and maximizing expected service delivery when a supply chain is exposed to supplier and environmental disruptions. Compared to a supply chain that uses neither strategy and is exposed to supplier and environmental disruptions, both practices reduce expected lost sales, reduce expected total cost, and increase the expected service level. Our results show that the backup-suppliers practice is more effective than the flexible-suppliers practice, as measured by cost reduction and service-level improvement. In addition, we show that a hybrid practice created by adding some level of flexibility to a backup-suppliers practice is more desirable in terms of lowering pre-disruption investment, increasing the responsiveness of the supply chain, and lowering the expected total cost. Moreover, the result of the simulation shows that on average, the proposed stochastic model could decrease the company's total cost by 5.51%. It also shows that planning and investing in proactive demand management could decrease the company's total cost by 7.87%.

Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory research design, which adopted a qualitative approach was used to achieve the study’s research objective. Qualitative data were gathered through 23 semi-structured interviews with key supply chain actors across the PSC in the UK. Findings: The findings demonstrate that CAS, as a theory, provides a systemic approach to understanding PSC resilience by taking into consideration the various elements (environment, PSC characteristics, vulnerabilities and resilience strategies) that make up the entire system. It also provides explanations for key findings, such as the impact of power, conflict and complexity in the PSC, which are influenced by the interactions between supply chain actors and as such increase its susceptibility to the negative impact of disruption. Furthermore, the antecedents for building resilience strategies were the outcome of the decision-making process referred to as co-evolution from a CAS perspective. Originality/value: Based on the data collected, the study was able to reflect on the relationships, interactions and interfaces between actors in the PSC using the CAS theory, which supports the proposition that resilience strategies can be adopted by supply chain actors to enhance this service supply chain. This is a novel empirical study of resilience across multiple levels of the PSC and as such adds valuable new knowledge about the phenomenon and the use of CAS theory as a vehicle for exploration and knowledge construction in other supply chains.",10.1108/SCM-05-2019-0184,Supply Chain Management,Complexity | Operations management | Pharmaceuticals | Resilience | Supply chain disruptions | Supply chain vulnerability,85100795594,Advancing the understanding of pharmaceutical supply chain resilience using complex adaptive system (CAS) theory,2021.0

In most business scenarios, the supply chain network is becoming one of the most vital focusing areas. In the supply chain network, blockchain technology is a promising solution for secure information sharing. However, it is a bit critical in maintaining security at each level of the blockchain and hence the public–private–key cryptography is more commonly preferred. This study intends to construct a new privacy preservation model in the field of supply chain networks based on blockchain technology by undergoing three major phases, namely, (a) data sanitization, (b) key generation, and (c) restoration. Further, the sensitive fields in the original data are selected during the data sanitization phase, and in the key generation phase; the optimal key is generated to hide the selected sensitive fields. The hidden data with the secured key is transferred from the source (manufacturer) to destination (vendor) in the supply chain network via the blockchain. The restoration process takes place in the receiver side with the help of the same key. Among all these data flow methods, the optimal key selection is the critical issue that needs to be overridden to make the data transmission secured. As a novelty, a new optimization algorithm referred to as Whale with New Crosspoint-based Update (WNU), which is the advanced version of Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), is developed here to select the optimal key. Finally, the proposed WNU model is analyzed in terms of Hiding Failure (HF) rate, Information Preservation (IP) Rate, and False Rule generation (FR), and Degree of Modification (DM).

37,"© 2013 IEEE. Increasing global warming, climate change and stringent governmental legislations are driving industry practitioners and decision makers to implement various strategies to reduce carbon emissions. One of the effective approaches to mitigate carbon emissions is the implementation of closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). The key motivation for considering multiple recovery options in the CLSC is to capture the remaining economic value and to reduce carbon emissions in the collection and recovery operations. Customer's willingness to return used product depends on the acquisition price and nearness to the collection center. This research proposes a deterministic mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for a multi-period and multi-product CLSC network under carbon pricing and carbon trading policies consideration. The model includes different acquisition price for returned products and multiple recovery options. Further, the study takes into consideration uncertainty in procurement cost, demand, and quantity of returned products. A robust optimization approach is adopted to address uncertainty in network parameters. Numerical results show that the proposed model captures trade-offs between total cost and carbon emission. Overall, the study reveals that the carbon trading policy incurs relatively lower total cost compared to the carbon pricing policy. Repair and recycling activities in the reverse supply chain contribute significantly to the total cost and carbon emission. This study provide evidence that it is possible to achieve an optimal CLSC network with reduced carbon emission at a moderate total supply chain cost. The proposed model could be used to guide firms to choose an appropriate budget of uncertainty toward achieving a robust supply chain network.",10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3046684,IEEE Access,carbon policies | closed-loop supply chain | mixed-integer linear programming | multi recovery options | reverse logistics | robust optimization | Sustainable manufacturing | uncertainty,85098748157,Robust Design of a Closed-Loop Supply Chain Considering Multiple Recovery Options and Carbon Policies under Uncertainty,2021.0

Therefore, the sustainability of food supply chains has gained ground; however, the sustainability of perishable food supply chains, is still not a fully explored field of study. Therefore, in this research, a multi-objective mathematical programming model is developed to optimize the cost, energy consumption, and the traffic congestion associated with such supply chain operations. In this study, product lifetime uncertainty is explicitly modeled as a Weibull random variable, and food perishability is assumed to be affected by vehicle refrigerator utilization, which is considered as a decision variable. In addition, multiple vehicle types and multiple product types are considered. A dairy supply chain case is investigated, and the interrelations and interactions of all three aspects of sustainability, also known as the three triple bottom lines (TBL) of sustainability, are studied. The results indicate that emphasizing the economic aspect, for highly perishable products, the environmental impact of the chain may increase by 120%, and for the highly congested road networks, the social impact may rise by 51%. However, a 15% economic compromise can improve the sustainability of the supply chain network design by 150%.

Also, only controlling the inventory of the spare part is not enough; instead, the supply chain of the spare part needs to be managed efficiently. Moreover, every organization now aims to have a resilient and sustainable supply chain to overcome the risk of facility disruption and to ensure environmental sustainability. This paper thus aims to establish a model of inventory-location relating to the resilient supply chain network of spare parts. Design/methodology/approach: First, applying queuing theory, a location-inventory model for a spare parts supply chain facing a facility disruption risk and has a restriction for CO2 emission, is developed. The model is later formulated as a non-linear mixed-integer programming problem and is solved using MATLAB. Findings: The model gives optimal decisions about the location of the warehouse facility and the policy of inventory management of each location selected. The sensitivity analysis shows that the very low probability of facility disruption does not influence controlling the average emission level. However, the average emission level certainly decreases with the increment of the disruption probability when the facility disruption probability is significant. Practical implications: Using this model, based on the cost and emission parameters and the likelihood of facility disruption, the spare part’s manufacturer can optimize the total average cost of the spare part’s supply chain through making a trade-off between productions, warehouse selection, inventory warehousing and demand allocation.

43,"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd The fast depletion of fossil fuels and adverse environmental impact from combustion have triggered an urgent need for new, cleaner and sustainable energy resources. In the last few decades, biodiesel has been introduced as an alternative due to its advantages over fossil fuels, which include higher flash point, improved lubricity, and lower toxicity. However, high production cost of biodiesel is one of the major hindrances in making the commercial feasibility of biodiesel viable. Biodiesel can be obtained from various sources such as waste cooking oil, vegetable oil, animal fat, etc. Among these sources, animal fat which is a non-edible feedstock and currently being used in low-cost processes is one of the best options. To make the commercial feasibility of biodiesel viable, this research presents an animal fat-based biodiesel supply chain network design optimization model. The suggested optimization model minimizes the cost of total biodiesel supply chain operations besides minimizing the carbon emissions during the involved operations. The complex and dynamic business environment of the biodiesel supply chain leads to a high degree of uncertainty, as a result, the effectiveness of strategic level decisions is compromised. To model this uncertainty, a solution methodology based on robust possibilistic programming (RPP) is employed. To show the applicability of the proposed model and solution methodology, numerical experiments and sensitivity analysis on a real case study is performed. Case results depict that RPP based solution methodology can achieve efficient solutions having a high degree of robustness. The experimental results also indicate that by investing almost 16% higher cost, the strategic and tactical level decisions of the proposed biodiesel supply chain model can be secured against the inherent uncertainty. It is also revealed that for the given case, logistics-related activities are almost 80% of the total supply chain cost, which if managed efficiently, can play a significant role in making the commercial feasibility of biodiesel doable. The proposed model and its findings can be efficiently utilized by the policymakers and investors in the animal fat-based biodiesel production sector.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122403,Journal of Cleaner Production,Animal fat | Biodiesel | Carbon emissions | Robust possibilistic programming | Supply chain management,85090279053,A robust possibilistic programming approach toward animal fat-based biodiesel supply chain network design under uncertain environment,2021.0

Focusing on tree-shaped supply chain system consisting of plants, distribution centers and retailers, an appropriate network structrue design approach was developed. By considering demand uncertainty of the retailers and interruption risks of the plants and distribution centers, a supply chain location-inventory decision model with the goal of minimizing expected total cost of the system was established. The model could be used to determine the locations, number and storage capacities of the distribution centers, as well as the replenishment / delivery assignment level of each plant / distribution center to each distribution center / retailer. To rapidly solve the proposed model, a hybrid genetic algorithm with a specific cost analysis method embedded in the genetic algorithm framework was designed, and the operation ideas and implementation steps of the algorithm were given. In addition, the experiments were constructed to verify the effectiveness of the model and its algorithm, and the deduction was obtained simultaneously that under uncertain demand environment, the decision result by considering multi-echelon facility interruptions was better than those without considering facility interruptions or considering only single-echelon facility interruptions.",10.13196/j.cims.2021.01.025,"Jisuanji Jicheng Zhizao Xitong/Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems, CIMS",Hybrid genetic algorithm | Location-inventory model | Multi-echelon facility disruption | Supply chain network optimization | Uncertain demand,85101019638,Supply chain location-inventory decision model and its optimization algorithm with multi-echelon facility disruptions,2021.0
45,"© 2020 The objective of this study was to understand the impacts of COVID-19 crisis in agriculture and food systems in Nepal and assess the effectiveness of measures to deal with this crisis. The study draws policy implications, especially for farming systems resilience and the achievement of SDGs 1 and 2. The findings are based on (i) three panel discussions over six months with policy makers and experts working at grassroots to understand and manage the crisis, (ii) key informants' interviews, and (iii) an extensive literature review. Results revealed that the lockdown and transport restrictions have had severe consequences, raising questions on the achievement of SDGs 1 and 2, especially in the already vulnerable regions dependent on food-aid. This crisis has also exposed the strengths and limitations of both subsistence and commercial farming systems in terms of resiliency, offering important lessons for policy makers. Traditional subsistence farming appears to be somewhat resilient, with a potential to contribute to key pillars of food security, especially access and stability, though with limited contributions to food availability because of low productivity. On the other hand, commercial farming - limited to the periphery of market centres, cities, and emerging towns and in the accessible areas - was more impacted due to the lack of resilient supply networks to reach even the local market. Lower resiliency of commercial farming was also evident because of its growing dependence on inputs (mainly seeds and fertilizer) on distant markets located in foreign countries. The observation of crisis over eight months unleashed by the pandemic clearly revealed that wage labourers, indigenous people, and women from marginalized groups and regions already vulnerable in food security and malnutrition suffered more due to COVID-19 as they lost both external support and the coping mechanisms. The findings have implications for policies to improve both subsistence and commercial farming systems – in particular the former by improving the productivity through quality inputs and by diversifying, promoting and protecting the indigenous food system, while the latter through sustainable intensification by building reliant supply network linking farming with markets and guarantying the supply of inputs.",10.1016/j.agsy.2020.102990,Agricultural Systems,COVID-19 pandemic | Food security | Food sovereignty | Subsistence farming | Sustainable development goals | System resilience,85095951110,COVID-19 impacts on agriculture and food systems in Nepal: Implications for SDGs,2021.0

In part this is because the unprecedented breadth of the novel coronavirus&#x0027;s impact has required organizations to strengthen their stakeholder orientation, given the second-order, network effects of management decisions during a global pandemic on unseen, unknown constituencies. In part this is because even our causal models and modes of group sense-making have been affected by the suffering and uncertainty caused by the pandemic. This paper draws from ongoing research on complex stakeholder networks, applying recent advances in graph theory to establish that organizations with more resilient, more efficient, more globally connected stakeholder networks better satisfy the claims of their stakeholders, across an array of financial and environmental, social and governance metrics. This research can be extended into post-crisis, chaotic and disordered domains by adapting the Cynefin framework, from the Welsh word for habitat, and applying it to the stakeholder theory literature.

An inventory management problem is addressed for a make-to-order supply chain that has inventory holding and/or manufacturing locations at each node. The lead times between nodes and production capacity limits are heterogeneous across the network. This study focuses on a single product, a multi-period centralized system in which a retailer is subject to an uncertain stationary consumer demand at each time period. Two sales scenarios are considered for any unfulfilled demand: backlogging or lost sales. The daily inventory replenishment requests from immediate suppliers throughout the network are modeled and optimized using three different approaches: (1) deterministic linear programming, (2) multi-stage stochastic linear programming, and (3) reinforcement learning. The performance of the three methods is compared and contrasted in terms of profit (reward), service level, and inventory profiles throughout the supply chain. The proposed optimization strategies are tested in a stochastic simulation environment that was built upon the open-source OR-Gym Python package. The results indicate that, of the three approaches, stochastic modeling yields the largest increase in profit, whereas reinforcement learning creates more balanced inventory policies that would potentially respond well to network disruptions. Furthermore, deterministic models perform well in determining dynamic reorder policies that are comparable to reinforcement learning in terms of their profitability.",10.3390/pr9010102,Processes,Inventory management | Multi-echelon | Reinforcement learning | Stochastic programming | Supply chain,85099846631,Algorithmic approaches to inventory management optimization,2021.0

Epidemic outbreak (COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2) is an exceptional scenario of agri-food supply chain (AFSC) risk at the globalised level which is characterised by logistics’ network breakdown (ripple effects), demand mismatch (uncertainty), and sustainable issues. Thus, the aim of this research is the modelling of the sustainable based multi-tier system for AFSC, which is managed through the different emerging application of Internet of things (IoT) technology. Different IoT technologies, viz., Blockchain, robotics, Big data analysis, and cloud computing, have developed a competitive AFSC at the global level. Competitive AFSC needs cautious incorporation of multi-tiers suppliers, specifically during dealing with globalised sustainability issues. Firms have been advancing towards their multi suppliers for driving social, environments and economical practices. This paper also studies the interrelationship of 14 enablers and their cause and effect magnitude as contributing to IoT-based food secure model. The methodology used in the paper is interpretative structural modelling (ISM) for establishing interrelationship among the enablers and Fuzzy-Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (F-DEMATEL) to provide the magnitude of the cause-effect strength of the hierarchical framework. This paper also provides some theoretical contribution supported by information processing theory (IPT) and dynamic capability theory (DCT).

52,"CCBY The intake of the perishable fruits and vegetables (FVs) in the human diet can contribute to reduce the risk of some chronic diseases. But unfortunately, FVs loss rate is high among all the food produced annually and occurs at storage stage of post-harvest life cycle. One of the key factors contributing to this high loss rate is inability to gauge vital ambient environmental parameters in cold storage. The existing monitoring solutions about cold storage are limited to only gauge temperature, relative humidity and ignore other vital ambient environmental parameters such as luminosity and concentration of gases. This is a critical issue that needs to be addressed to overcome the loss rate of FVs. This paper presents a real-time intelligent monitoring and notification system (RT-IMNS) banked on an Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled approach for real-time monitoring of temperature, relative humidity, luminosity and concentration of gas in cold storage and notifies the personnel on exceeding of dangerous limits of these parameters. Moreover, decision support is implemented in the RT-IMNS using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with forward propagation to classify the status of commodity into one of three classes i.e. good, unsatisfactory or alarming. The proposed prediction model outperforms Compress Sending (CS), Adaptive Na&#x00EF;ve Bayes (ANB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Data Mining (DM) with respect to forecasting accuracy. We achieved 99% accuracy using forward propagation neural network model while existing models such as CS, ANB, XGBoost, DM achieved 95.60%, 87.50%, 93.59%, 90% accuracy respectively.

53,"© 1993-2012 IEEE. Counterfeit integrated circuits (ICs) have become a significant security concern in the semiconductor industry as a result of the increasingly complex and distributed nature of the supply chain. These counterfeit chips may result in performance degradation, profit reduction, and reputation risk for the manufacturer. Therefore, developing effective countermeasures against such malpractices is becoming severely crucial. Physical unclonable function (PUF)-based authentication methods have the potential to mitigate these challenges. However, PUF-based solutions are restrained by several factors, such as additional design efforts and significant area/power overhead, struggle to maintain and update challenge-response pairs (CRPs) database, and the vulnerability to machine learning (ML) attacks. In this article, we address these challenges by developing a novel database-free and enrolment-free hardware authentication approaches, i.e., a digital watermark metric for ICs. To enable efficient database-free hardware integrity verification without enrolment, first, we transform the intrinsic variations in circuit parameters, e.g., boundary scan chain (BSC) path delays in the joint test action group (JTAG) chain into robust digital signatures. Then, we perform statistical analysis on a small pilot unit of authentic chips to create a robust watermark for a complete batch of chips, which jointly captures the characteristics of the physical layout, the manufacturing process, and the foundry. The increasing complexity in the current state-of-the-art designs makes it extremely hard for an adversary to perfectly clone such statistical characterization of circuit parameters using counterfeit or compromised hardware. Besides, the proposed approach requires no additional design or hardware overhead in IC design since it utilizes an embedded structure, which inherently exists within the chips. It also obviates the design house from characterizing each manufactured chip instance, reducing overall testing cost. A path-delay measurement method at a high resolution based on clock phase sweep is introduced to measure the delay values effectively. The proposed intrinsic identifier-based authentication approach is validated by performing emulation on FPGAs and also by conducting physical measurements on custom-made printed circuit boards (PCBs). The reliability of the generated watermarks is evaluated with environmental temperature fluctuations and the aging effect.",10.1109/TVLSI.2020.3039723,IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems,Database-free | emulation | enrolment-free | experimental | joint test action group (JTAG) | principal component analysis (PCA) | runtime authentication | watermark,85097936573,On Database-Free Authentication of Microelectronic Components,2021.0
54,"© 2020 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies Online and omnichannel retail developments placed logistics at the front-end of consumers’ purchase journeys. Particularly the last mile of the supply chain increasingly affects consumer satisfaction, while its financial and environmental impact is critical. “Crowd logistics” is introduced as a promising solution. As consumers are increasingly driving innovation and initiatives in the last mile, it is important to know their preferences and perceptions. Our objective is to identify which type of consumer is interested in a crowdsourced last mile and which particular crowd logistics services are considered interesting. To this end, we set up a survey among a sample of one-thousand consumers that represent the Belgian population. The survey is analysed using descriptive statistics and two-step cluster analysis. Analysis shows that consumers support neighbour relays and delivery by retailers’ employees, but general interest is low. A cluster analysis identifies four attitudinal profiles. One segment, labelled the “trailblazers”, are most likely to adopt crowdsourced last mile services: they strongly prefer delivery at home and rely on their community of neighbours when a delivery fails. They are more interested in last mile innovations and sustainability enhancements. The research contributes by taking a consumer perspective on the last mile and by including three types of services and four types of crowd. Three recommendations for retailers are formulated, to focus on a crowdsourcing solution that combines collection and delivery among their employees’ local network, to target consumers that fit the identified profile and to accentuate crowd logistics’ quality of enhancing information transparency.",10.1016/j.tbs.2020.08.004,Travel Behaviour and Society,Consumer preferences | Crowdsourcing | E-commerce | Last mile delivery | Omnichannel retail | Sharing economy,85089524049,Who is interested in a crowdsourced last mile?

Amid the ongoing uncertainty, circumstances varied across business sectors and regions, but the common goal for business organizations was to respond effectively, devising strategies to survive the turmoil and accelerate recovery. The narrative in India was no different from the rest of the world. Due to the novelty of the event, literature regarding its impact on the strategic management of firms was scarce. Thus, this paper aims to attempt to ascertain the crisis impact on firms and subsequently unravel the tactical short-term and long-term strategic responses initiated by Indian firms. Design/methodology/approach: The authors carried out an empirical investigation to comprehend the strategic foresight adopted by Indian firms. Following a structured literature review, the authors conducted semi-structured open-ended interviews with 28 business experts who were involved in drafting strategic responses for their respective firms. Subsequently, the authors performed a thematic content analysis of the expert interview responses to document firm-level strategic responses to the COVID-19 crisis and associated economic lockdown. The authors further searched reputed media articles to supplement and triangulate the primary research findings with management perspectives. Findings: The authors identified that managers had adopted a dual approach responding to the disruption. Companies simultaneously focused on surviving the crisis in the short-term by reconfiguring existing resources and initiated long-term recovery by mobilizing efforts for a redesigned business model. The research findings indicated that companies had adapted to the dynamic chaotic crisis environment to fulfill the changed consumer expectations. Remote working was widely implemented, supply networks were adjusted, operations were managed with minimal resources, working capital was closely monitored and the product-portfolio was revamped to reap benefits in an essentials-only world. The impact of several strategic firm responses was determined through this study on the revenue, profitability, operational costs and regulatory adherence of the companies along with the ability to meet stakeholder expectations. The study suggested that companies encouraged innovative solutions and highlighted the importance of collaborative inter-organizational practices. Research limitations/implications: The study contributed to an inter-theoretical perspective on firm strategic initiatives to confront a global crisis. Resource-based view, dynamic capabilities perspective and industrial-organizational theory-based perspectives, were applied. This facilitated an extensive analysis of the entire business ecosystem to identify various paths to accelerated recovery during and post COVID-19 world. Practical implications: The research findings would aid managers in drafting a comprehensive response strategy during and post COVID-19 world. This study results would help managers in addressing multiple concerns such as the sustainability of operations in the short-term through working capital management, the fulfillment of changing consumer needs through sustained innovation and business model alterations to ensure long term growth. The study enabled managers to prioritize necessary actions, ascertain the impact of strategic initiatives and build sustainable competitive advantage for long-term growth.

57,"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd Motivated by a real-world case, this paper deals with uncertainty issues in the resilient and sustainable electricity supply chain network design. Uncertainty is always found in electricity demand prediction and perfect foresight is not possible. The resilience of electricity networks in face of uncertainty can prevent catastrophic impacts. Besides, due to the growing concerns about social impacts, considering social measures along with the other measures is becoming critical when analyzing the network costs. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization model is developed, which consists of the total cost in the first objective, resiliency measures in the second objective, and some aspects of corporate social responsibility in the third objective. The resiliency measures minimize de-resiliency, including successive establishment, distributed generators inadequacy, congestion through electrical lines, and energy dissatisfaction level. A novel robust approach is also proposed to deal with the uncertainty of electricity demand based on the light robust programming and possibilistic theory in the fuzzy logic. By investigating a real case in Iran, the contributions of the considered measures, and the effects of uncertainty are analyzed. The analyses reveal that by applying the proposed model the decision-makers can enhance corporate social responsibility and resiliency by 50% and 20%, respectively, although it increases the total cost by 50%. Moreover, the results of applying the proposed fuzzy-robust approach show that how the decision-makers can effectively allocate the uncertainty budget and protection level to attain more robust solutions in terms of standard deviation and mean value of the total cost.",10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115921,Applied Energy,Corporate social responsibility | Electricity supply chain network design | Fuzzy-robust programming | Resiliency | Uncertainty,85092083200,Innovative strategy to design a mixed resilient-sustainable electricity supply chain network under uncertainty,2020.0

This is because the joint decisions can ensure firms to obtain higher profits while contributing to sustainable environments. However, due to the problem complexity, no models facilitating such decision making are available. This study aims to develop a model to help firms make optimal joint decisions. To model the situations where a manufacturer is the leader and the retailers are followers, we adopt the Stackelberg game theory and develop a 0–1 mixed nonlinear bilevel program to maximize the profits of both the manufacturer and his retailers. We further develop a nested genetic algorithm to solve the game model. Numerical examples demonstrate (i) the applicability of the game model and the algorithm and (ii) the robustness of the algorithm. Managerial insights are obtained, suggesting that (i) manufacturers need to identify the capacity ranges (called capacity traps) where capacity increases result in reduced profits when making decisions to optimize profits; (ii) retailers should make suitable, e.g., pricing decisions so that the manufacturers can include them in the supply chains; (iii) both manufacturers and retailers may not need to consider the carbon emission buying (or selling) price when making decisions.",10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113733,Expert Systems with Applications,Emission control | Joint decision making | Nested genetic algorithm | Nonlinear bilevel programming | Stackelberg game,85088392654,"Joint production planning, pricing and retailer selection with emission control based on Stackelberg game and nested genetic algorithm",2020.0

What implications can be derived for future research and practices concerning sustainability issues? In this conceptual article, we critically discuss the current status of complexity research in EM. In this regard, we use IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, because it is currently considered the leading journal in EM, and is as a reliable, heuristic proxy. From this journal, we analyze 38 representative publications on the topic published since 2000, and extrapolated through a rigorous keyword-based article search. In particular, we show that: (1) the adoption of CT has been associated with a wide range of key themes in EM, such as new product development, supply chain, and project management. (2) The adoption of CT has been witnessed in an increasing amount of publications, with a focus on conceptual modeling based on fuzzy logics, stochastic, or agent-based modeling prevailing. (3) Many key features of CT seem to be quite clearly observable in our dataset, with modeling and optimizing decision making, under uncertainty, as the dominant theme. However, only a limited number of studies appear to formally adhere to CT, to explain the different EM issues investigated. Thus, we derive various implications for EM research (concerning the research in and practice on sustainability issues).",10.3390/su122410629,Sustainability (Switzerland),Complexity theory | Conceptual | Engineering management | Management | Sustainability,85098132810,Discussing the use of complexity theory in engineering management: Implications for sustainability,2020.0

These stakeholders continue to tackle disruptions to supply chain systems through the introduction of strategy options for resilience. A better understanding of broader dimensions of potential disruptions to supply chains caused by uncertainties has become eminent, especially as currently experienced during the global COVID-19 pandemic. The effects of the outbreak in disrupting supply chains in the energy sector will, in the next decade, continue to be a likely concern for industry and research stakeholders. Balancing the increasing need for energy security to meet the continuous growth in energy demand through shortage reduction and increased uptime using optimization is the core of this research. This review paper provides an insight into recent studies in the field of natural gas supply chain resilience as a major player in the energy mix, and the continued disruption and subsequent shutdowns of plant nodes, which results in emission loss to the environment. This paper is motivated by the disparity between demand and supply triggered by the disruption of supply chain networks. Referenced in this paper are scientific work on supply chain resilience of biomass, water, power systems, and natural gas.

Building on transaction cost economics theory and social network theory, we investigate the impact of dimensions of buyer-supplier network (BSN) complexity (horizontal, vertical, and spatial) on firms' environmental performance, specifically, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Using secondary data from diverse sources on the supply networks of 319 firms, extending to the Tier-2 level, we present and test a robust empirical model that also accounts for potential endogeneity effects. To understand this key relationship between BSN complexity and environmental performance at a deeper level, we further test the moderating influence of BSN members' reach on this key relationship. We also test the moderating effects of a focal firm's control over its BSN on this key relationship. We find that both the vertical complexity dimension and the horizontal complexity dimension of BSNs had a U-shaped relationship with the participating firms' GHG emissions. In contrast, the spatial complexity dimension of BSNs had a positive impact on the participating firms' GHG emissions. With respect to the moderating effects, we found that firms' control over their BSN negatively influenced these relationships, whereas the reach of the BSN members positively influenced these relationships.

The supply chain (SC) ability to return quickly and effectively to its initial condition or even a more desirable state after a disruption is critically important, and is defined as SC resilience. Nevertheless, it has not been sufficiently quantified in the related literature. This study provides a new metric to quantify the SC resilience by using the stochastic programming. Our metric measures the expected value of the SC's cost increase due to a possible disruption event during its recovery period. Based on this measure, we propose a two-stage stochastic program for the supply chain network design under disruption events that optimizes location, allocation, inventory and order-size decisions. The stochastic program is formulated using quadratic conic optimization, and the sample average approximation (SAA) method is employed to handle the large number of disruption scenarios. A comprehensive computational study is carried out to highlight the applicability of the presented metric, the computational tractability of the stochastic program, and the performance of the SAA. Several key managerial and practical insights are gained based on the computational results. This new metric captures the time and cost of the SC's recovery after disruption events contrast to most of previous studies and main impacts of these two aspects on design decisions are highlighted. Further, it is shown computationally that the increase of SC's capacity is not a suitable strategy for designing resilient SCs in some business environments.",10.1016/j.ijpe.2020.107755,International Journal of Production Economics,Conic mixed-integer program | Resilience metrics | Stochastic programming | Supply chain network design,85085111493,Stochastic optimization of disruption-driven supply chain network design with a new resilience metric,2020.0

Existing resilience metrics require detailed knowledge of the system and potential disruptions, which is not available in the early design stage. The lack of quantitative tools to guide the early stages of design for resilience, forces engineers to rely on heuristics (use physical redundancy, localized capacity, etc.). This research asserts that the required quantitative guidelines can be developed using the architecting principles of biological ecosystems, which maintain a unique balance between pathway redundancy and efficiency, enabling them to be both productive under normal circumstances and survive disruptions. Ecologists quantify this network characteristic using the ecological fitness function.

With the emergence of internet-based devices, the traditional industrial control system (ICS) networks have evolved to co-exist with the conventional IT and internet enabled IoT networks, hence facing various security challenges. The IT industry around the world has widely adopted the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) as an industry standard to numerically evaluate the vulnerabilities in software systems. This mathematical score of vulnerabilities is combined with environmental knowledge to determine the vulnerable nodes and attack paths. IoT and ICS systems have unique dynamics and specific functionality as compared to traditional computer networks, and therefore, the legacy cyber security models would not fit these advanced networks. In this paper, we studied the CVSS v3.1 framework’s application to ICS embedded networks and an improved vulnerability framework, named CVSSIoT-ICS, is proposed. CVSSIoT-ICS and CVSS v3.1 are applied to a realistic supply chain hybrid network which consists of IT, IoT, and ICS nodes.

However, the role of the private sector in disaster management operations (DMOs) is not as prominent as the role played by (inter)governmental agencies. This article aims to investigate the relationship of collaboration and resilience in disaster management supply networks (DMSNs). Design/methodology/approach: Supply network resilience criteria were defined as robustness, flexibility, velocity and visibility based on the literature review. DMSN capabilities were identified characterising each resilience criterion through the development of the Collaboration–Resilience (COLRES) Analysis Framework for DMSNs. This theoretical model was then applied to an empirical case study in the Philippines using semi-structured interviews for data gathering. Findings: A total of 46 cross-sector collaboration activities were identified across four disaster management phases and linked to the resilience criteria. A causal analysis of each collaboration activity and its outcome was conducted to identify relationships between collaboration types and resilience constructs. Based on these results, patterns were identified, and dependencies between collaboration and resilience were defined. Collective DMSN resilience (DMSNRES) enabled by existing cross-sector collaboration activities was evaluated against a future disaster scenario to identify resilience gaps. These gaps were used to recognise new cross-sector collaboration opportunities, thereby illustrating the continuous process of resilience building. Research limitations/implications: This research provides new insights on how private sector is involved within a DMOs through collaboration with the government and other NGOs. It augments existing literature on private sector involvement in DMOs where common perception is that the sector is only involved in short-term response and recovery activities. This study finds that the private sector can be operationally involved not just in post-disaster activities, but also in mitigation and preparation phases as well. This then sets a new baseline for further research on private sector involvement within DMOs. As this study provided a novel framework to analyse collaboration activities and its impact to DMSN resilience, future work could be done by applying the model to further cases such as other countries'. DMSNs, or to more specific contexts such as inter-organisational collaborations rather than big sectors. A more detailed assessment method against a future disaster will prove relevance for the model in providing practical insights on how resilience can be built in DMSNs. Practical implications: This research proposed a novel DMSN collaboration-resilience (COLRES) model (Figure 11) to analyse existing processes in preparation for specific disasters. Practitioners may be able to use this model with the goal of identifying resilience gaps to fill and continuously improve their processes. The model also provides practitioners the lens to improve processes with the perspective on collaboration to complement government and NGO efforts and expertise with those of the private sector. For the private sector perspective, this research provides new insights on how they can be more involved with the community to provide more sustainable and long-term contributions to the society. Social implications: With disasters becoming more complex and frequent by the day and as humanitarian actors focus on improving their expertise, the need for every piece of the society to contribute to disaster risk reduction is continuously intensified. This research shows that each sector of the society can take part in disaster management operations to reduce unpredictability, lives impacted and increase speed of response and recovery. Each sector of the society can be of great contribution not only during post-disaster response and recovery but also during pre-disaster mitigation and preparedness phase. As such, this research echoes the call for everyone to be involved in disaster risk reduction and mitigation as a way of life. Originality/value: This research ultimately finds that cross-sector collaboration builds resilience in DMSNs through capacity building, redundancy sourcing, information reliability and logistics responsiveness. This study shows that the private sector is able to go beyond existing short-term partnerships by participating in the 46 collaboration activities identified across four disaster management phases in order to build resilience in DMSNs.",10.1108/JHLSCM-09-2019-0066,Journal of Humanitarian Logistics and Supply Chain Management,Collaboration | COVID-19 | Disaster management | Earthquake | Flood | Pandemic | Philippines | Resilience | Supply network | Tsunami,85096207590,A collaboration–resilience framework for disaster management supply networks: a case study of the Philippines,2020.0

To this day, sales & operations planning (S&OP) remains one of the most critical challenges of supply chain management in terms of improving customers’ experience level and managing supply chain costs. Nowadays the synchronization of sales essentials and industrial restrictions in an uncertain environment is critical for all global companies facing complexity in supply chain networks and operations systems. Sales and supply chain structures in build-to-order industries generally have cross-functional and conflicting objects that are not easily comparable. The current research is an extension of an innovative S&OP model within a more dynamically complex system in terms of demands uncertainty and unreliability of backup supplies. The promoted model is utilized for more efficient management and integration of industrial restrictions and sales essentials in global supply chain networks in terms of demand and supply coordination and responsiveness toward customers’ needs. Accordingly, this research has applied a simulation-based optimization approach to balance the trade-off between logistics cost and customers’ experience level as the main objectives. Two classes of strategies are offered for handling parts’ replenishment and flexibility to the sales structure. Initially, the proposed model evaluates two main inventory strategies’ performances. Thereafter, the optimized values of flexibility degree and safety stock fraction for corresponding inventory strategies are calculated by using a multi-objective simulation-optimization method.

Trying to meet the Sustainable Development Goals is challenging. Food supply chains may have to become more efficient to meet the increasing food requirement of 10 Billion people by 2050. At the same time, food and nutrition security are at risk from increasingly likely shocks like extreme climate events, market shocks, pandemics, changing consumer preferences, and price volatility. Here we consider some possibilities and limitations regarding the improvement of resilience (the capacity to deal with shocks) and efficiency (here interpreted as the share of produced food delivered to consumers) of food supply chains. We employ an Agent Based Model of a generic food chain network consisting of stylized individuals representing producers, traders, and consumers. We do this: 1/ to describe the dynamically changing disaggregated flows of crop items between these agents, and 2/ to be able to explicitly consider agent behaviour. The agents have implicit personal objectives for trading. We quantify resilience and efficiency by linking these to the fraction of fulfilment of the overall explicit objective to have all consumers meet their food requirement. We consider different types of network structures in combination with different agent interaction types under different types of stylized shocks. We find that generally the network structures with higher efficiency are also more sensitive to shocks, while less efficient network types display more resilience. At first glance these results seem to confirm the existence of a system-level trade-off between resilience and efficiency similar to what is reported in business management and ecology literature. However, the results are modified by the trading interactions and the type of shock. In our simulations resilience and efficiency are affected by ‘soft’ boundaries caused by the preference and trust of agents (i.e., social aspects) in trading. The ability of agents to switch between trading partners represents an important aspect of resilience, namely a capacity to reorganize. These insights may be relevant when considering the reorganization of real-life food chains to increase their resilience to meet future food and nutrition security goals.",10.1371/journal.pone.0242323,PLoS ONE,,85096457517,An agent based model representation to assess resilience and efficiency of food supply chains,2020.0
84,"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd Biomass is a valuable renewable source of energy as an alternative to fossil fuels. The main barriers in biomass and biofuel development are feedstock high cost, lack of reliable supply, and uncertainties. A systematic review of comprehensive solution tools to overcome the biomass supply chain (BSC) planning challenges is critical for both academic research and industry. Therefore, the aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review of BSC modeling and optimization and identify future research directions. We reviewed 300 papers that have been published in the past 40 years on this topic to assess the various models of BSCs, their objective functions, solution approaches, and decision levels employed. Results show that researchers are motivated to use mixed integer programming models for BSC problems because of the complexities of nonlinear models, as well as the simplicity of the linear approaches. There is a lack of multi-objective optimization approaches to address the economic, social, and environmental issues simultaneously in BSC. Although factors such as the political regulation, governmental subsidy, impact of biomass and oil price and cost of raw material are uncertain, most studies formally treat only the supply and demand of biomass as uncertain parameters. It is highly recommended that an integrated and holistic model that consider all facilities in the whole BSC be developed and tested with real data. In addition, incorporating strategic, tactical, and operational decision levels in the model is suggested to address the challenges of incorporating day-to-day inventory control and fleet management issues.",10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.105777,Biomass and Bioenergy,Biofuel | Biomass supply chain | Optimization methods | Sustainability | Uncertainty,85091377194,"Biomass supply chain environmental and socio-economic analysis: 40-Years comprehensive review of methods, decision issues, sustainability challenges, and the way forward",2020.0

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is an ambitious infrastructure and development project promoting sustainable economic growth through facilitating prosperous trade across Eurasia and Africa; however, its potential remains underexploited. Logistics networks along BRI routes face several challenges that hinder efficient operations. In addition, although uncertain of how the initiative will develop, logistics and supply chain management (LSCM) practitioners must align their networks with future developments. This study aims to synthesize current barriers to the BRI from an LSCM perspective; propose strategies for dealing with them; and outline and assess conceivable BRI development scenarios to create awareness for possible international logistics network developments. The study builds on a structured and moderated Nominal Group Technique exercise among 15 LSCM professionals to extract current barriers, mitigation strategies, and potential development scenarios, followed by a survey among 52 LSCM professionals to assess those issues. The study synthesizes and assesses 17 BRI barriers for LSCM practice and proposes 20 strategies for dealing with them, assessed in terms of effectiveness and complexity. Moreover, 14 development scenarios are assessed in terms of their probability of becoming reality and impact on the vulnerability of logistics networks, categorized into four scenario clusters (monitor, prepare, propel, and exploit) for guiding LSCM practice.",10.3390/su12219110,Sustainability (Switzerland),Belt and Road Initiative | International logistics networks | New Silk Road | Nominal Group Technique | One Belt One Road | Scenario analysis,85095418858,Decrypting the belt and road initiative: Barriers and development paths for global logistics networks,2020.0

Purpose: Performing retailing in a complete omnichannel manner is not a simple task, and it considerably increases the complexity of supply chain management operations. This paper aimed at identifying the barriers hindering efficient management of a return channel in this type of retail. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review procedure was used, including descriptive and content analysis of results. The review was performed using four academic databases. Applicable barriers were categorized thematically, a conceptual framework was proposed and future research avenues were drawn. Findings: The contribution of this paper comprises a theoretical description of reverse logistics applied to omnichannel retail, the identification of the return barriers in omnichannel and a conceptual framework for a holistic view of the problem. In all, 43 barriers were identified including high investments, product restocking, additional transportation costs and poor communication. Research limitations/implications: The link between reverse logistics and omnichannel area is recent and publications are still scarce, so the newness of this study limits the opportunity for further deepening or more robust validation of the results. Practical implications: The results offered may be used by managers in the areas of retail and supply chain management in general in order to reduce the natural complexity in omnichannel environment.

In the recent times, remanufacturing and recycling processes have been widespread because of hard environmental legislations. The significance of green factors such as uncertainty of return rates in supply networks has been extensively acknowledged in presented studies. A revenue sharing contract improves the performance of green supply chain and has a significant role in the profitability of total supply chain. There are few quantitative studies on revenue sharing contract in green supply chains. In this study, we propose coordination subject matters of a green supply chain with recycling perishable goods, involving suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, together with collection and disposal centers, in a multi-product, multi-period and multi-level basis under Fuzzy conditions. The consequences indicate that in dairy industries, appropriate collected returned products could be used as raw material for another product, which increases the supply chain profits and reduces waste; and also, since perishable goods have a limited shelf life, they can be reusable if they are collected before reaching to a critical time.

88,"© 2020 The Author(s) This paper discusses an optimization model for handling the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic based on food supply network through regional food hubs (RFHs) under uncertainty. To this end, uncertainty is assumed in the demand and production data. During the Pandemic COVID-19 period, uncertainty has increased and the food supply chain system has changed. Thus, a new configuration of the food supply network requires analysis. In this paper, the concept of RFH is introduced to connect producers in rural areas and customers in urban areas. This paper determines the location and capacity of RFHs, the food supply network, the sum of maximum food supplies, and minimum logistics cost. This is done via a Multi-Objective Many-to-Many Location-Routing Problem model. Furthermore, since the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain, robust optimization is employed to handle uncertainties. During the current pandemic, red zones are defined to indicate the severity of the pandemic in a region. In this paper, the numerical experiment is considered for three scenarios: when a region is in large-scale social distancing, partial social distancing, or normal conditions. This social distancing situation is based on the defined red zones. The optimal food supply network is obtained for the three scenarios and the best scenario among the three is identified.",10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05128,Heliyon,Agricultural policy | COVID-19 pandemic | Food security | Logistics | Many-to-many location-routing problem | Multi-objective | Regional food hubs | Robust optimization | Sustainable business | Systems engineering | Systems theory,85091738354,Scenarios for handling the impact of COVID-19 based on food supply network through regional food hubs under uncertainty,2020.0

90,"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd The context of the sustainable supply chain (SSC) is progressively getting attention among supply chain (SC) managers due to its competitive advantage in firms' performance. Increasing supply chain complexity (SCC) is argued as one of the biggest risks in achieving the organisational goal with an adverse impact on operational efficiency, cost, profitability, on-time delivery, and customer satisfaction. Though drivers of SSC and SCC have seemingly demonstrated mutual relationship in a practical scenario, supply chain managers tend to address respective drivers independently for managing and controlling. Limited availability of literature investigating interactions among drivers of SSC and SCC with its overall impact on the supply chain motivates deeper research. To address the gap, current research aims to study the mutual relationship between SSC and SCC drivers. To achieve this, a combination of sequential exploratory two-phased research methodology is adopted. The Delphi technique is initially applied to identify the critical SSC and SCC drivers followed by using interpretive structural modeling (ISM) to decipher the mutual relationship among the SSC and SCC drivers. The interactions between SSC and SCC drivers explored in this work will provide supply chain managers a framework for informed decision making. The driving and dependence power of drivers can guide SC practitioners to prioritize and focus on key drivers with a high impact on the overall outcome. The organization can also be benefitted by managing SSC and SCC drivers in synergy against the silo approach. The research finding suggests that market uncertainty, institutional regulations, strategic supplier collaboration, customer pressure, and new technologies are key five drivers in decision-making.",10.1016/j.resourpol.2020.101726,Resources Policy,,85086479532,"Analysis of supply chain sustainability with supply chain complexity, inter-relationship study using delphi and interpretive structural modeling for Indian mining and earthmoving machinery industry",2020.0

Meanwhile ASC is a good example of a strategy drawing heavily on digitization since as a demand chain management it was information-centric and technology-centric from its inception. Yet, despite this relationship, a lack of coherence and clarity around the input of technology for ASC has impeded to portray accurately the relative importance of digitization in ASC strategies.

In response, a growing number of food retailers and manufacturers have committed to reducing N2O emissions from their vast networks of farmer suppliers by providing technical assistance and financial incentives. A key challenge for such companies is demonstrating that their efforts are leading to meaningful progress toward their climate mitigation commitments. We show that a simplified version of soil surface nitrogen (N) balance—or partial N balance—the difference between N inputs to and outputs from a farm field (fertilizer N minus crop N), is a robust indicator of direct N2O emissions from fields with maize and other major rainfed temperate-region crops. Furthermore, we present a generalized environmental model that will allow food-supply-chain companies to translate aggregated and anonymized changes in average N balance across their supplying farms into aggregated changes in N2O emissions.

Reverse logistics (RL) is gradually becoming more important to manufacturing companies through environmental awareness, competitiveness, and environmental regulations. In the leather footwear industry of Bangladesh, it is possible to recycle and reuse waste, meaning a reverse logistics system could increase return-on-investment and give a competitive advantage. To date, studies on barriers to RL implementation have been conducted in other countries and in other domains, leaving a research gap in RL barrier analyses in the leather footwear industry. There are many obstacles to implementing RL in a developing country like Bangladesh; examining these barriers is a crucial research issue. This paper identifies RL barriers through (1) an extent literature review, (2) advice from Bangladeshi industry experts under the Delphi study, and (3) ranking RL barriers using the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process. The results indicate that, of the barriers investigated, the ‘knowledge and support’ category seems to be most critical. A lack of interest and support from top-level management—related to ‘knowledge and support’ issues—appears to be the major obstacle for RL implementation in the Bangladeshi leather footwear industry. These findings will help the Bangladeshi leather footwear industry, as well as other industries in Bangladesh, to understand the nature of each barrier and overcome the complexity of RL implementation in supply chains. This study will also assist decision-makers in making certain strategic policies.

This is particularly true for products with attributes that hasten deterioration, e.g. time, temperature, humidity and barometric pressure. Attribute-sensitive products must be carefully monitored throughout all supply chain processes to ensure acceptable quality to the end customers. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the scientific literature on attribute sensitive products and on attribute sensitive supply chains. The collected studies were reviewed using the content analysis method, focusing on the following aspects of attribute sensitive products: (1) industries; (2) product categories; (3) decisions involved; (4) processes; (5) current issues; (6) sustainability concerns; (7) research methods used; (8) objectives of decision makers; (9) solution approaches used; (10) incentives driving management and (11) future research issues. Based on the analysis of findings, gaps are identified, and future research directions are proposed. Design/methodology/approach: Literature review and content analysis. Findings: The authors discovered that, while the importance of product attributes vary from one industry to the other, overall the time attribute was critical in all of the industries considered in this literature review. Coordination, customer satisfaction, reliability and safety were key issues in attribute sensitive product supply chains (asp-SCs). Similar to the typical supply chains, asp-SCs face economic, social and environmental sustainability issues. However, the majority of the studies in our analysis emphasized importance of the social sustainability. The majority of the papers were reviewed and analyzed and adopted the modeling approach as a research method. Furthermore, it was found that asp-SCs were mostly driven with customer demands and social pressure. Research limitations/implications: Based on the literature review and content analysis, there are a number of directions for the work conducted in this study to be extended in several directions. First, the literature search could be expanded by relaxing some of the restrictions (e.g. include the conference papers and articles from on-line business journals). Second, additional scientific publishers can be considered (e.g. Emerald Insight–www.emeraldinsight.com; Inderscience–www.inderscience.com). The latter two extensions would allow a more precise assessment of published to date work on asp-SC operations. Third, our findings could be validated based on interviews with professionals and executives from companies dealing with asp-SCs. Such validation will allow identification of the differences between the state of the art and the state of practice. Practical implications: Supply chains that handle attribute sensitive products (asps) must consider the complexity of products that significantly change their properties due to factors such as time, temperature, barometric pressure, humidity. Mismanagement of operations within such supply chains may lead to significant product waste, as well as substantial monetary losses.

Purpose: Research has extensively focused on the cultural differences in supply chain collaboration while neglecting the importance of cultural similarities and compatible goals among supply chain members. With the rise of global supply chain network, the choice of supply chain orientation is critical. This study argues that performance differences between these configurations highlight managerial implications for sustainable development. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing from uncertainty reduction and cognitive social capital theories, this study developed a taxonomy of manufacturing firms based on process alignment between cultural compatibility and supply chain communication. The empirical data used in this study were drawn from the Global Manufacturing Research Group (GMRG) survey project, with data collected from 680 manufacturing companies, across various industry sectors and countries. Findings: There appeared to be consistent three major configurations: the Proactive, the Initiative and the Reactive. Manufacturers distanced themselves based mainly on communication with customers on events and proprietary information. Communication-cultural compatibility taxonomies influence differently on operations and financial performance. The Initiative, who excelled in communication practices gained significant improvement in efficiency and delivery measures. While Reactive lagged, Proactive aligned in both capabilities to experience higher payoffs in operational and financial measures. The findings offer a step-by-step approach where manufacturers intensify communication with partners for better efficiency and delivery measures, then align cultural practices to obtain financial, quality and innovation performance. Research limitations/implications: It will be fruitful for future research to examine the evolution of longitudinally. A comparison between developed and developing economies will be of interest. Practical implications: The findings provide a step-by-step decision-making process for supply chain communication and offer guidance especially for global supply chain managers.

The proliferating need for sustainability intervention in food grain transportation planning is anchoring the attention of researchers in the interests of stakeholders and environment at large. Uncertainty associated with food grain supply further intensifies the problem steering the need for designing robust, cost-efficient and sustainable models. In line with this, this paper aims to develop a robust and sustainable intermodal transportation model to facilitate single type of food grain commodity shipments while considering procurement uncertainty, greenhouse gas emissions, and intentional hub disruption. The problem is designed as a mixed integer non-linear robust optimisation model on a hub and spoke network for evaluating near optimal shipment quantity, route selection and hub location decisions. The robust optimisation approach considers minimisation of total relative regret associated with total cost subject to several real-time constraints. A version of Particle Swarm Optimisation with Differential Evolution is proposed to tackle the resulting NP-hard problem. The model is tested with two other state-of the art meta-heuristics for small, medium, and large datasets subject to different procurement scenarios inspired from real time food grain operations in Indian context.

A model of the hydrogen supply chain (HSC) based on MILP formulation (mixed integer linear programming) in a multi-objective, multi-period formulation, implemented via the ε-constraint method to generate the Pareto front, was conducted in a previous work and applied to the Occitania region of France. Three objective functions have been considered, i.e., the levelized hydrogen cost, the global warming potential, and a safety risk index. However, the size of the problem mainly induced by the number of binary variables often leads to difficulties in problem solution. The first innovative part of this work explores the potential of genetic algorithms (GAs) via a variant of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to manage multi-objective formulation to produce compromise solutions automatically. The values of the objective functions obtained by the GAs in the mono-objective formulation exhibit the same order of magnitude as those obtained with MILP, and the multi-objective GA yields a Pareto front of better quality with well-distributed compromise solutions. The differences observed between the GA and the MILP approaches can be explained by way of managing the constraints and their different logics.

Findings reveal that product-level practices focused on raw materials more than design initiatives, with operational benefits of cost reduction and market benefits of consumer value-add. Process-level practices in water and energy reduction were motivated by cost reduction benefits more than environmental concerns.

The closed-loop supply chain networks (CLSCN) include the returns processes and the producers aim to capturing additional value considering further integration of all supply chain activities. Therefore, all return processes need to be optimized as well as considering environmental impacts leading to form a closed-loop green supply chain network (CLGSCN). For decision making purposes, operational and tactical decision making levels are integrated to configure a coordinated supply chain network aiming to maximize profit while keeping environmental-friendly policies. The case is more sophisticated in melting industries where the collection and categorization in return process and different environmental challenges should be considered at the same time. Thus, in this paper, a CLGSCN of a melting industry is modeled with respect to environmental hazards to optimiza overall profits.

The academic community and practitioners widely recognize the significance of risk management and integrative practices in supply chains to deal with complexity and uncertainties faced. Firms strive to manage risk, handle unexpected disruptions and improve performance in ever changing uncertain business environments.

Subsequently, the mediating role played by SCRM between SCI and firms’ operational performance is examined. In this paper, covariance-based structural equation modeling is applied to test the developed hypotheses using data of 931 manufacturing companies obtained from the sixth version of International Manufacturing Strategy Survey (IMSS VI). The findings of the study suggest that internal, supplier and customer integration positively effects SCRM whereas the impact of internal integration is also partially mediated by supplier and customer integration. Additionally, the results present that SCRM partially mediates the relationship between internal integration and operational performance and fully mediates the association between supplier and customer integration and operational performance.

105,"© 2020 The Authors Closed-loop supply chain network design (CLSCND) has been increasingly spotlighted over the latest decade. The focus has been given to maximize the economic performance, resource utilization and sustainability through incorporating a holistic decision-making on both forward and reverse logistics. In this paper, a new fuzzy-stochastic multi-objective mathematical model is formulated for sustainable CLSCND. The model aims at balancing the trade-off between cost effectiveness and environmental performance under different types of uncertainty. The environmental performance of CLSCND is measured by carbon emission. Moreover, the network flexibility is modeled and incorporated in the decision-making so that customer demands can be fulfilled by different means. In order to solve the complex optimization problem, the model is first defuzzilized and converted into an equivalent crisp form. Then, a sample average approximation based weighting method (SAAWM) is developed to obtain a set of Pareto optimal solutions between cost and carbon emission under different uncertain environments. The model is validated through a set of numerical experiments. The computational results show, through the incorporation with network flexibility, the proposed mathematical model and solution approach can effectively generate consistent objective values and solutions over different scenario trees and obtain robust strategic decisions on facility locations. Meanwhile, the flexibility and rationality of the decision-making on transportation management, demand allocation and facility operations can be improved as well.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121702,Journal of Cleaner Production,Closed-loop supply chain network design | Facility location | Fuzzy programming | Multi-objective optimization | Network flexibility | Stochastic programming,85084797415,A fuzzy-stochastic multi-objective model for sustainable planning of a closed-loop supply chain considering mixed uncertainty and network flexibility,2020.0

Supplier selection and order allocation are important keys for reverse logistics and closed-loop supply chain networks especially with the presence of demand–supply imbalance risks. If such uncertainties and risks are not foreseen in the chain, and corresponding appropriate measures are not taken to handle them, irreparable damages would be expected consequently. The importance of this issue in closed-loop supply chains is more appreciated due to the importance and the effect of this chain on the environment. In this research, the disruption risk and the uncertainties related to the demand, market price, and the number of returned products are simultaneously considered. Purchasing from the backup suppliers and spot market are considered, to take the proper measures in case of uncertainties. Two-stage stochastic programming model is used to express the uncertainty. The decisions on the purchase from the uncertain suppliers, and reserving from backup suppliers are made in the first step. Then, after determining the uncertainties, return decisions (purchasing from the backup suppliers, spot market and the use of returned products) are made. Besides, we develop our model with CVaR risk measurement tool, and assess risk neutral and risk averse models.

Background To contribute toward the dialogue on addressing non-communicable and chronic disease in humanitarian emergencies, this article will explore the experiences of Médecins Sans Frontières in attempting to find support for the haemodialysis network in Yemen. With the changing profile of the global disease burden and a broadening concept of emergency health needs to include chronic illness and disability, the aid sector has committed through the World Humanitarian Summit and the Sustainable Development Goals to leave no one behind and thus to meet the health needs of these previously excluded and highly vulnerable people. The civil war in Yemen compromised the medical supply chain supporting the health facilities providing dialysis for patients with end-stage renal disease. The article will critique the aid sector’s slow response to this issue and expose the gap between principles, commitments, and practice related to noncommunicable disease in emergencies. Method Following direct experiences from the authors as leaders in the aid response in Yemen, reviews of grey literature from aid and health actors in Yemen were conducted along with a review of literature and policy documents related to noncommunicable disease in emergency. Key informant interviews and press statements supported analysis and events that took place in the time span of roughly 4 years that frames this period of analysis. Results Examination of the impacted patient population, interviews, literature and documented events indicates that there is discord between policy, commitments stated by aid donors and practice. Conclusion The aid sector must use a more contextualised approach when designing programmes to manage the burden of non-communicable diseases in health contexts where crises occur, particularly for lifesaving forms of therapy. Aid agencies and the global health community must increase pressure on donors and implementing agencies to live up to their commitments to include these patient populations.",10.1093/pubmed/fdz133,Journal of Public Health (United Kingdom),,85089712705,The politics of exclusion: Fighting for patients with kidney failure in Yemen’s war,2020.0

Thus, implementation of appropriate recycling or disposal practices has emerged as the critical challenge for the industries aiming to improve their environmental sustainability while satisfy the customers’ needs and maintain the economic benefits. In this study, a multi-level closed-loop supply chain network is developed under deterministic and uncertain conditions to maximize the time delivery, and minimize total costs, and environmental impacts under the uncertainty of some parameters. A three-objective mixed integer linear programming model is proposed. The delivery time of purchased materials from suppliers to the manufacturing plants is maximized using the first objective function. The network overall profitability is maximized using the second objective function, and the negative environmental impacts are minimized using the third objective function. Furthermore, to overcome the innate uncertainty of the models’ parameters, the Soyster and Mulvey approaches are applied. The developed model is implemented in a case study of a Tire Company. The results revealed the efficiency of on-time delivery considerations on the selection of internal and external suppliers. Applying the VIKOR method demonstrated the better performance of Soyster method compare to the Mulvey method.

Applying sustainability and resilience concepts in a supply chain means the simultaneous optimization of the cost and recourses, including human and environmental ones, in facing possible risks. This paper tries to fill this gap by considering them simultaneously in a closed-loop supply chain. For this, a new mixed-integer programming (MIP) model was formulated for a closed-loop supply chain. In this research, different dimensions of sustainable development have been taken into account through reducing the total cost, energy consumption, and pollution and increasing job opportunities, and multiple-sourcing strategy has been applied for the resiliency of the supply chain. To validate the proposed model, the real data of a tire industry was used and the model was solved using the ε-Constraint method.

Supply chains provide the critical infrastructure for the production and distribution of goods and services in our network economy and serve as the conduits for the manufacturing, transportation, and consumption of products ranging from food, clothing, automobiles, and high-technology products, to healthcare products. Cities as major population centers serve not only as the principal demand points but also as the locations of many of the distribution and storage facilities, transportation providers, and even manufacturers. In this paper a new model is developed for the design of sustainable supply chains with a focus on cities that captures the frequency of network link operations, which is especially relevant to cities due to frequent freight deliveries.

The first aim of this paper is to move towards CE through redesigning a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network for durable products, which are one of the most widely used category of goods. For this purpose, various recovery facilities are taken into account in CLSC structure; and cost, CO2 emissions, and energy consumption are taken into consideration as multiple objectives. The relevant mixed integer linear programming model is developed to make supplier selection, location-allocation, transportation mode, assembly technology, and recovery level decisions. Given that the strategic and tactical decisions in a CLSC are largely influenced by uncertainties, finding robust solutions is of great importance. The second aim of this study, thus, is to introduce and formulate novel robust optimization models by ways of possibilistic programming and scenario-based stochastic programming. These models are developed in linear terms to cope with different types of uncertainties including randomness and epistemic. Numerical examples are conducted based on some real energy and CO2 data. The results reveal the superiority of the circularity versus linearity in the supply chain.

Interactions between technological solutions for managing waste and energy supply chains are multilateral and can vary significantly, depending on multiple criteria and different characteristics. This concept paper puts forward a conceptual framework for sustainable development based on the notion of ""intelligence"" for Waste-to-Energy (WtE) strategies. The pillars of intelligence are defined and the quadruple helix model for energy transitions based on waste management is established. The ""smart"" nodes of a WtE supply chain management are analytically presented and discussed. Nevertheless, the intelligent notion for a supply chain cannot stand on its own. Systematical support of a participatory process is needed via Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools and e-techniques to be promoted for collective facilitation and sustainable management. This process encompasses intelligent residents and professionals as producers of waste and smart managers to supervise the supply chain towards sustainable management of energy and waste resources. It is argued that the ICT participatory interface has a multiplying effect, especially when adopting the middle pathway approach in local and/or decentralized level towards smart energy production from waste. Innovative solutions to maximize waste efficiency through the collaborative power of ICT networks is critical to be deployed within local communities. These can be based on internet of things, big data, operational modeling, complex systems science, games and narratives, and social networks. The conceptual framework presented herein provides a basis for decision support towards sustainable development and interaction through a creative pathway of collaboration applicable to all the levels of potential synergies. Main conclusions and future challenges indicate that more research effort is required by the scientific community to leverage on the collaborative power of social networks and to efficiently apply ICT methods for adopting the ""socially-oriented"" middle pathway approach within communities' empowerment.

Earthquakes can cause significant damage to liquefied gas terminals, a critical part of lifeline facilities of energy supply networks, failure of which may lead to loss of hazardous material, explosion, environmental contamination, loss of functionality and disruption of business. To date, seismic risk analysis of such facilities mainly focuses at component level, with the inherent dynamic interaction between the supporting structure and non-structural components not receiving the merited attention. In the present study, the seismic performance of an actual facility comprising of a piping system and a reinforced concrete (RC) supporting structure is analyzed through a finite element model in the nonlinear regime, both as coupled and decoupled case. Plastic strains are used as engineering demand parameters (EDP) to define leakage limit state for pipes. Since the RC pipe rack supporting structure is designed for low seismic loads, shear is recognized as the predominant failure mode. The same components are then analyzed in unison, considering coupling due to dynamic interaction. Fragility functions are estimated for both cases using multiple stripe analysis. A set of strong ground motions artificially generated using the specific barrier model, are employed for developing fragility curves. They are expressed with peak ground acceleration (PGA) as an intensity measure. Statistical estimation of the parameters of fragility functions are based on maximum likelihood method. It is inferred that in the decoupled case, pipes show higher vulnerability at lower PGA, at higher PGA pipe rack can fail suddenly resulting in total failure of the system. Moreover, in coupled case the fragility of the pipes and RC rack changes substantially because of the piping system boundary conditions. Thus, concluding that the risk estimation could be erroneous if dynamic interaction is neglected.",10.1007/s10518-020-00896-y,Bulletin of Earthquake Engineering,Dynamic interaction | Fragility analysis | Piping network | Supporting RC structure | Vulnerability analysis,85087088474,Seismic fragility analysis of LNG sub-plant accounting for component dynamic interaction,2020.0

The groundwater vulnerability has been evaluated using the DRASTIC model under a GIS environment. This well-known model is based on the combination of seven parameters, Depth to water, net Recharge, Aquifer media, Soil media, Topography, Impact of vadose zone, and hydraulic Conductivity, that are considered as directly controlling the vulnerability of groundwater to potential risks. However, the original model does not consider the effect of urban land uses (urban sprawl and density) on groundwater so a modified DRASTICU model, that includes Urban land use as an eighth parameter has been applied. The net recharge assessment was also modified to include the contribution of leakages from water supply network and sewage networks to the aquifer recharge. On the other hand, soil classes of the aquifer and the vadose zone that are not included in the original listing of the model have been discussed and rated. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out to evaluate the effect of each individual parameter on the vulnerability zoning and to validate the use of each one. The validation of the DRASTICU model was done through the comparison between groundwater vulnerability index and nitrate concentrations.

Supporting these needs rests on the existence of interoperable Internet of Things (IoT) platforms for traceability that goes beyond the minimum “one up, one down” scheme required by regulators. Seafood farmers, being the source of both food and food-information, are critical to achieving the needed transparency. Traditionally, seafood farmers carry the costs of providing information, while downstream actors reap the benefits, causing limited provision of information. Now, global standards for labelling, data from IoT devices, and the reciprocity of utility from collecting data while sharing them represent great potential for farmers to generate value from traceability systems. To enable this, farmers need an IoT platform integrated with other IoT platforms in the value network.

Although research on these networks and partnerships has been increasing, it has remained heterogeneous. It derives from many different disciplines and research communities, leaving behind an opaque field of literature. This article provides a critical overview and a comprehensive understanding of research on inter-organizational networks and governance partnerships of the textile and clothing industry through a systematic literature review. It analyzes 301 academic peer-reviewed articles published between 1992 and 2018. It uses quantitative full-text bibliometric word analysis, followed by coding around the meta-framework of modes of governance, which provides an integrative framework for this field of study. Firstly, this analysis revealed four discourses referred to as Economic and Industrial Development, Ecology and Environment, Private Labor Governance and Workers’ Rights, and Critical Ethnographies. Secondly, these four discourses were found to differ in their thematic sustainability challenges as well as in their variety of governance modes and partnerships. Research on economic sustainability tends to focus on modes of central and public-private governance; research on environmental challenges focus more on private governance of supply networks and; research on social sustainability tends to focus on more participatory, interactive and self-governing modes between multiple actors. The analysis provides a unique classification of scientific articles through modes of governance, which is helpful in positioning research in the debate, analyzing and comparing approaches and thus highlighting current gaps and opportunities for future research.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate how sub-suppliers decouple the implementation of sustainable supply management practices in supply chains, and what institutional logics permit these suppliers to do so. Design/methodology/approach: Following a qualitative design, we conducted 23 in-depth semi-structured interviews with owners and managers of apparel sub-suppliers. To corroborate research findings, the views of owners and managers were triangulated by further interviewing 18 key representatives of wide-ranging institutional actors. Findings: The findings suggest that owners and managers of sub-suppliers use two decoupling responses: (1) consensual strategy to compromise sustainability requirements (2) concealment strategy. In addition, this paper identifies multiple institutional types of conflicting logics: instrumental logic, legitimacy logic complexity and gaps in normative logic, which interplay amongst sub-suppliers whereby permit to decouple the implementation of supply management practices. Research limitations/implications: While the current paper provides an early contribution from the perspectives of second-tier and third-tier suppliers, future research could be extended to include further upstream sub-suppliers and downstream tiers including the end consumers. Practical implications: It is important for brand-owning retailers and first-tier suppliers to predict sub-suppliers' decoupling behaviour and conflicts for supply management practices implementation since they may present potential vulnerability for buyers and lead suppliers. Originality/value: This study extends the application of institutional theory and contributes to the literature on extended suppliers' supply management practices in a developing country context, which is an under-researched area.",10.1108/IJOPM-05-2019-0403,International Journal of Operations and Production Management,Apparel industry | Consensual and concealment strategies | Developing country sub-suppliers | Institutional theory | Sustainable supply management,85087553035,The hidden side of sub-supplier firms' sustainability – an empirical analysis,2020.0

Secondly, based on the cost composition of the supply chain operating in the interrupted environment, measurement model of supply chain resilience is established. Thirdly, by introducing the time that the customers can wait as an indicator to represent the external demand environment of supply chain, the customer expectation can be distinguished quantitatively, and the customer expectation factor can be integrated into the measurement model of supply chain resilience. Finally, based on the measurement model of supply chain resilience, quantitative results of the supply chain resilience measurement are obtained, and the relationship between the results and resilience measures is analyzed based on resilience analysis, which illustrates the relationship between the unit capital investment and its ability to reduce order losses.",10.1016/j.ress.2020.106869,Reliability Engineering and System Safety,Cost | Customer expectations | Interruption | Resilience | Supply chain,85081026448,A resilience measure for supply chain systems considering the interruption with the cyber-physical systems,2020.0
127,"© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature. Closed loop supply chain network design (CL-SCND) is a critical economic and environmental activity. The closing of the loop to handle return, uncertainty in business environment, various supply chain risks, impact network design processes and performance of the firm in the long term. Thus, it is important to design robust and reliable supply chain structures and obtain network configurations which can always outperform the other configurations under the worst cases of risks and uncertainty. A generic closed-loop supply chain network based on mixed integer programming formulation is proposed with direct shipping to the customer from manufacturing plants as well as shipping through distribution centers under supply risks, transportation risk and uncertain demand using a robust optimization (RO) approach. A large number of numerical tests are carried out to test the performance of the model by considering a total of four levels of uncertainty for four different network structures types. The results of the tests confirm that the risk and uncertainty based integrated supply chain network models are more efficient (cost effective) than the other set of network configurations which treats the supply chain risks and uncertainty post-ante. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model, the case of an Indian e-commerce firm which wants to redesign its supply chain structure is presented. The results of case study show that the topology obtained from integrated treatment of risk and uncertainty called as RORU model, outperform other supply chain networks on various network performance indicators such as supply chain costs, the number of facilities open or close and the amount of products flowing through supply chain echelon. Thus, RO based mathematical modeling to address risks and its applicability for SCND for close loop supply chain is proposed, demonstrated and applied in practical cases.",10.1007/s10479-018-2902-3,Annals of Operations Research,Closed-loop supply chain network | Economic and environmental goals | Robust optimization | Supply chain risk | Sustainable operations,85047396073,Closed-loop supply chain network design and modelling under risks and demand uncertainty: an integrated robust optimization approach,2020.0

As policies and regulations related to environmental protection and resource constraints are becoming increasingly tougher, corporations may face the difficulty of determining the optimal trade-offs between economic performance and environmental concerns when selecting product technology and designing supply chain networks. This paper considers weight reduction technology selection and network design problem in a real-world corporation in China which produces, sells and recycles polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles used for soft drinks. The problem is addressed while taking consideration of future regulations of carbon emissions restrictions. First, a deterministic mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to analyze the influence of economic cost and carbon emissions for different selections in terms of the weight of PET bottle, raw material purchasing, vehicle routing, facility location, manufacturing and recycling plans, etc. Then, the robust counterpart of the proposed mixed-integer linear programming model is used to deal with the uncertainty in supply chain network resulting from the weight reduction. Finally, results show that though weight reduction is both cost-effective and environmentally beneficial, the increased cost due to the switching of the filling procedure from hot-filling to aseptic cold-filling and the incumbent uncertainties have impacts on the location of the Pareto frontier. Besides, we observe that the feasible range between economic cost and carbon emission shrinks with weightreduction; and the threshold of restricted volume of carbon emission decreases with the increase of uncertainty in the supply chain network.",10.1007/s10479-017-2696-8,Annals of Operations Research,Carbon emission | Product development | Supply chain networks | Sustainability | Weight-reduction technology,85032681313,Weight reduction technology and supply chain network design under carbon emission restriction,2020.0

However, a range of risks relating to food safety and product fraud requires this industry to develop an effective traceability solution. In response to this biometric identification techniques are seen as a possible solution to provide greater security compared to the current tag-based tracking systems. This paper describes how a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be used in conjunction with image processing techniques to enable an autonomic grading solution in the SRL supply chain. The research is an essential part of an overall investigation into designing a low-cost biometric identification solution for tracking lobsters along their supply chain from catch to table. By using a CNN, the research aims to improve the previous research on lobster grading in establishing a reliable and flexible traceability method to meet different supply chain contexts. In this approach, a pre-trained Mask-RCNN model was adopted to extract regions of interest from lobster images. The deep learning ability of this model allows the carapace areas to be segmented from lobster images automatically for calculating grading attributes including size, weight and colour. This outcome then also generates a high-quality input dataset for the follow-up research on identifying individual lobsters. To prove the effectiveness, the proposed method was validated on a large image dataset collected at a lobster processor and tested on mobile application environment. The findings establish a critical contribution to the complete biometric solution developed for SRL products traceability.",10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.107184,Food Control,Grading | Image processing | Mask-RCNN | Southern Rock Lobster | Traceability,85080129456,An application of Convolutional Neural Network to lobster grading in the Southern Rock Lobster supply chain,2020.0
130,"© 2020 John Wiley  &  Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment Perishable food supply chains (PFSCs) are characterized with rising food quality and safety concerns, alarming food wastages and losses, and poor economic sustainability. Because of the perishable nature of products and limited shelf life, management of sustainability in PFSCs is critical. Many studies on sustainability in PFSCs have considered developed countries; however, developing countries have not gathered the required research attention in this domain. In this paper, a decision theory-based framework is adopted, where a prescriptive decision analysis methodology is used to generate preferences among the challenges to sustainability in PFSC. An integrated interpretive structural modelling–analytic network process (ISM–ANP) decision framework is formulated to identify and model key challenges to sustainability in PFSCs, keeping a developing economy like India under consideration. The contextual relationships amongst the extracted challenges are analyzed using the ISM methodology. The relationships identified from ISM are used as inputs in the ANP methodology, to generate the priority weights of the challenges. The findings of the integrated methodology show that “lack of horizontal integration of farmers,” “poor pre-harvest management,” and “lack of government regulation and support” are the most critical challenges for sustainability in PFSCs. The results show that organizations must work on aggregation of farm produce and integration of farmers with the market. Development of infrastructures and cold chain facilities at the farm level is necessary to mitigate these challenges to reduce wastages in PFSC.

Smallholder livestock farmers (SLF) are important in research and policy development agenda because of the everlasting issue of food insecurity and the livelihoods in sub-Sahara Africa. Lack of access to technologies and information, poor infrastructure and lack of access to markets and environmental factors play a key role in deterring sustainable smallholder livestock farming. In recent years, studies have provided evidence that livestock species can play a role towards solving household food insecurity and enhancing Africa’s resilient livelihoods, particularly in rural settings. However, no studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of emerging technologies (available information technologies) as risk mitigation tools for smallholder livestock farmers. The study used survey data from 278 interviewer-administered questionnaires and 13 in-depth interviews village herds from Dumba, Mapayi, Old Nuli and Shabwe to explore whether rural SLF would use the emerging technologies to enhance their operations, and mitigate supply chain risk, exposures to stock theft and loss. Empirical results show the overwhelming need for the use of emerging technologies by the SLF, and that emerging technologies have significant and positive effects on the risk management activities. SLF indicated that, using digital technologies, they could enhance their risk mitigation and value chains. The results of the study have several policy implications. For instance, the agricultural comparative advantage should be improved through various emerging agricultural technologies. Moreover, the immediate rural development service networks for SLF could be strengthened through the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform to reduce livestock risk exposures, disasters and market reactions. Although rural livestock farming in Beitbridge has survived over the years at a subsistence level, the paper provides some interesting and pertinent findings, and projects some possible future research pathways.",10.3390/agriculture10070270,Agriculture (Switzerland),Emerging technologies | Food security | Livestock farming | Resilient livelihood | Smallholder farmers | Sub-Saharan Africa,85087388106,The resilience of smallholder livestock farmers in sub-saharan africa and the risks imbedded in rural livestock systems,2020.0

Background and aims: Natural gas is one of the most important energy sources used today in urban communities as cheap and hazardous energy. In this regard, if the government and organizations do not pay attention to the proper infrastructure for gas installations, it will create irreparable risks for that society. The assessment and management of crisis in the various processes can play a key role in the planning, organization and training of the target community. Today, the importance of increasing crisis management is not overlooked. Social and HSE crisis are the most important issues in the gas company. Crisis management results can be used for educational planning and resource management. Also, using the results of the crisis assessment can identify the weak points of the organization. Identifying weaknesses within an organization enables management to regulate the organization's strategies based on them and reduce the impact of the crisis effectively. The assessment of the risk of gas pipelines will be assessed by various criteria, such as the environment of the gas supply network and the social conditions surrounding the gas supply network. In the event of a crisis in gas distribution networks, the best way to prevent an increase in the crisis in urban and industrial areas is to ensure a rapid shutdown of gas transmission. The responsible organizations should use high-reliability facilities and equipment to reduce the crisis in the failure of the gas transmission lines in the network. The technical status of the gas supply pipelines and their maintenance are among other criteria for assessing the gas supply risk. Crisis in gas networks can have irreparable effects due to the direct connection of the network with residents of cities. The crisis in the gas supply network is causing fire and explosion and poisoning, but it can also lead to social crises. Since the gas company is a social institution. Its problems can affect the community. Therefore, the crisis management issue in the gas supply network is very important. Qazvin Gas Company is a government organization with more than 350,000 shareholders and customers in the province. The inadequate and old infrastructure has put the risk of crisis in this province's gas distribution network as unacceptable. Such organizations need to invest in building a strategic thinking in crisis management on how to design and deliver services to their customers. The purpose of this research is to determine and rank critical factors and assess the risk of crisis in gas distribution networks. Methods: In this research, three types of major crises associated with gas supply networks were identified by using reliable sources and experts' opinion. An expert is someone who has a BSE degree in Industrial Engineering or HSE, as well as 10 years of experience in the gas industry. Toxicity, fire - explosion and social problems are the most important gas grid crisis. then 11 criticality indicators were defined for assessing the risk of crisis in gas network. Decision-making criteria in this study include: health problems, mortality, political problems, costs of line reconstruction, groundwater contamination, cost of stopping services, damage to people in the region, air pollution, reduced income, lack of trust in the organization, Fear and horror. In this study, FAHP technique and the FROMETHEEII fuzzy technique for ranking were used. One of the most efficient and comprehensive techniques for deciding multiple indicators is the analytical hierarchical process. It was first raised by Thomas L Satty in 1980. This method has many uses in solving managerial, economic and social problems. This method allows the formulation of the problem in a hierarchical manner. It is also possible to consider different quantitative and qualitative indices in problem solving. In this process, different options are involved in decision making and it is possible to analyze the sensitivity of indicators and sub-indicators. This process based on paired comparisons facilitates judgment and indicates the degree of compatibility and incompatibility of the decision. PROMETHEE was designed in 1985 by Branc & Vincke. It was developed by colleagues in 1994. This method can be called the ""Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation"", which, as it is known from the name, seeks to structurally address problems and use the actual values of the criteria for evaluation. Using the FAHP results, the weight determines the importance of each of the critical factors in gas networks. Using the results of the PROMETHEE, we can determine the weight and rank of contributing factor and sub contributing Factor of crisis risk for the gas network. Then using the obtained results, the grid risk assessment model was presented. The crisis risk assessment model is designed considering the importance of the type of crisis scenario. The proposed model is: (Formula Presented) where in: SN is level of severity of risk of crisis; Stox is level of Toxic severity of risk; Wtox is the weight of toxic severity of risk; Sex is level of explosive severity of risk; Wex is the weight of explosive severity; Scut is level of severity of Cut off gas network and Wcut is the weight of cut off gas network. Using the proposed model, the gas network of Qazvin province was evaluated as a case study. The results of mean and standard deviation were used to analyze the results. In order to confirm the validity and reliability of the questionnaires, the literature review and other questionnaires were used. Then, the questionnaire was adjusted and after the insertion of the necessary information, for content validity, was given to the experts. Following the necessary amendments, the original questionnaires were set up and approved by the experts. The reliability of the questionnaires was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. For this purpose, after answering all the experts, the reliability of the questionnaires was calculated using SPSS software, which is about α=0.74. According to the results, reliability of the questionnaire is reliable. In order to collect the data, the researchers examined the study environment and completed the checklist. Results: The results showed that the crises created in relation to the gas network with weight importance are not equal. So that the social crisis caused by the disruption of gas in the urban gas supply network is more important. The results showed that the crises created in relation to the gas network were not equal to the weight. So that the social crisis caused by disruption of gas in the urban gas supply network is more important than the crisis caused by Toxicity and explosion. This is due to the fact that poisoning and explosion can also lead to social crises that have a cumulative effect on the social crisis caused by the disruption of gas. The results showed that the most important crisis in the gas company was a definite gas. Also, the results showed that the main criteria in the risk of gas distribution network crisis are: proximity to residential buildings, population density, proximity to industrial towns, and the existence of vulnerable network conditions. The conditions of different regions of the case study showed that the best conditions for the gas supply network in the 3rd district are due to the low number of residential buildings, low population density, distance from industrial settlements, and the absence of vulnerable conditions. Conclusion: Several studies in recent years have found that the failure of the gas line is the main cause of the gas grid crisis. The main reason for this is the placement of pipes in the gas network and its regulators on the roads of cars and individuals. In these studies, gas regulators are classified as one of the most vulnerable parameters in the crisis assessment. Also, the main reason for the gas supply crisis in many studies is the structural weakness of the network and network vulnerability. Also, in some studies, environmental conditions and type of use around the gas distribution network are described as contributing factors of the risk of gas pipeline leakage and vulnerability factors in the gas distribution network. The main reason for definite gas as a crisis in the gas network is the use of the gas network in residential homes, which is the case in countries like Iran. According to the results of this study, it was determined that for assessing the risk of crisis in gas networks, it is necessary to determine the crisis factors and to integrate them in order to determine the risk of crisis in the gas network. In the risk assessment process, the impact of personal judgment of the evaluators on determining the risk level of a process is very important. In this research, using decision making models has been tried to minimize the impact of personal judgment of evaluators. One of the most important results in this study was the existence of social crises due to the cut off gas distribution networks. Therefore, the definitive gas crisis is of great importance. This is most common in developing countries that use natural gas in final consumers for heating and cooking. Therefore, this indicates that the government in these countries is required to invest from gas to electricity in order to prevent social crises, to reform the process of gas consumption and change energy consumption in homes and commercial and office facilities. The assessment of social crises is a new aspect of this research that has not been addressed in other researches.",,Iran Occupational Health,Contributing risk factor | Crisis management | FAHP | FPROMETHEE II | Gas supply network | Risk,85097243219,Assessing the risk of crisis in gas distribution networks using the FAHP-PROMETHEE II method (Case study of Qazvin Province Gas Company),2020.0

The employment opportunities of recycled concrete aggregates will inevitably remain cautious due to the absence of well-established performance criteria. This paper is to investigate the influence of different granular compositions (recycled coarse and fine aggregate) on the mechanical characteristics and durability of concrete. Five series of concrete mixes, manufactured with various granular combinations (natural/recycled), were studied The formulation of the reference concrete was based on a constant quantity of 400 kg/m3of cement and a constant workability of fresh concrete securing S2 class of flowability and C25/30 concrete class, according to European standards. The experimental program consisted of comparing the long-term mechanical strength of concrete conserved in different types of water baths: fresh tap water sourced directly from the supply network, deionized water, and salt water. Also, the durability indicators were observed, such as capillary water absorption, porosity accessible to water, helium gas permeability, and an ammonium nitrate leaching test. The obtained results have highlighted the superiority of concrete composed of natural aggregate over concrete incorporating recycled aggregate for mechanical behaviour, case-observed with three types of water used as a conservation bath. The replacement of natural aggregate by recycled aggregate does not provide any substantial improvement in terms of durability.

Numerous climate-related emergencies highlight the challenges and urgency posed by climate change: the 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report, the Global Climate Action Summit in California, and international student walkouts, to name a few. While the IPCC Report sent an urgent cry to reduce total emissions and to achieve specific results—45% reduction by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050—reductions need to be combined with capturing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Scientific studies have shown that an annual increase of 0.4% of carbon stored in soils would make it possible to stop the present increase in atmospheric CO2. This Article focuses on carbon farming, a Climate Smart Agriculture strategy that uses plants to capture and store atmospheric carbon dioxide in soil to achieve the IPCC Report goal. This Article makes two contributions. First, recognizing the potential of private certifications to drive sales and investment (Organic-Certified food sales soared to $100 billion in 2018), this Article designs a new Carbon Farming Certification with an Organic or Regenerative Agriculture certification as a base, and an add-on module to measure carbon sequestration. Second, a carbon farming certification becomes a linchpin to accessing a greater network of resources to scale-up carbon farming: farmers leverage the Certification to gain access to immediate and long-term financing; to unlock lucrative opportunities to sell carbon credits to those who purchase carbon offsets in California’s cap-and-trade market; and to engage in forward contracting with major supply chains. State and local governments should leverage sequestered carbon metrics from Carbon Farming Certified-farms to demonstrate compliance with international law and treaty targets, as well as national and local climate policies. Filling gaps in food law and environmental governance literature, this Article presents a multidisciplinary approach to solving a critical global problem. It identifies barriers which hinder the scale-up of promising carbon farming strategies, including: insufficient information, lack of funding for innovation to drive down solution costs, inconsistent regulations that hinder project development and private sector commercialization, and a patchwork of quantification standards for ensuring carbon sequestration is measured consistently and fairly. The Article’s proposed solution draws from new developments in computer modeling simulation and metrics, carbon credits, and global best practices.

136,"© 2020 Coal byproducts represent an abundant and untapped potential source of critical rare earth elements (REEs). In this study, we tested the efficacy of a biosorption-based approach to recover REEs from leachate solutions derived from North Dakota lignite coal and Powder River Basin (PRB) coal fly ash. A pairwise comparison was performed using a range of cell densities of two distinct bacteria, including an Escherichia coli strain previously genetically engineered for cell surface display of lanthanide binding tags, and Arthrobacter nicotianae, a native bacterium that exhibits high REE adsorption capacity. At optimal cell densities, we observed a recovery efficiency of 80% for total REEs and > 90% for middle and heavy REEs from the lignite leachate. Higher cell densities were required to achieve a similar total REE recovery efficiency in the PRB leachate due to its higher non-REE content, which negatively impacted light REE recovery. Despite the chemical complexity of both feedstocks, separation factors ≥ 30 were observed for Nd relative to nearly all non-REE metals after a single adsorption/desorption cycle, highlighting the high adsorption selectivity for REEs. Quantification of impurities in the extracted metal solutions revealed that Ca and Mg content in the leachate solutions play a dominant role in both the REE recovery yield and purity. The Mg/Ca impurities can be further reduced by incorporation of a low pH wash step between the adsorption and desorption steps, yielding extracted concentrates with a REE purity (mass fraction REE of total metals) of 80% and 50% for lignite and PRB, respectively. Thermodynamic speciation analysis of the REE-enriched eluents from both feedstocks suggests that at a post-biosorption hydroxide precipitation step can be employed to yield high purity total REE precipitates. Collectively, these results highlight the utility of biosorption for selective REE recovery from coal byproducts and pave the way for a sustainable route to diversify the REE supply chain.",10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116726,Separation and Purification Technology,Biosorption | Coal | Coal combustion products | Critical material recovery | Rare earth elements,85079883346,A biosorption-based approach for selective extraction of rare earth elements from coal byproducts,2020.0

The increasingly global context in which businesses operate supports innovation, but also increases uncertainty around supply chain disruptions. The COVID-19 pandemic clearly shows the lack of resilience in supply chains and the impact that disruptions may have on a global network scale as individual supply chain connections and nodes fail. This cascading failure underscores the need for the network analysis and advanced resilience analytics we find lacking in the existing supply chain literature. This paper reviews supply chain resilience literature that focuses on resilience modeling and quantification and connects the supply chain to other networks, including transportation and command and control. We observe a fast increase in the number of relevant papers (only 47 relevant papers were published in 2007–2016, while 94 were found in 2017–2019). We observe that specific disruption scenarios are used to develop and test supply chain resilience models, while uncertainty associated with threats including consideration of “unknown unknowns” remains rare. Publications that utilize more advanced models often focus just on supply chain networks and exclude associated system components such as transportation and command and control (C2) networks, which creates a gap in the research that needs to be bridged. The common goal of supply chain modeling is to optimize efficiency and reduce costs, but trade-offs of efficiency and leanness with flexibility and resilience may not be fully addressed. We conclude that a comprehensive approach to network resilience quantification encompassing the supply chain in the context of other social and physical networks is needed to address the emerging challenges in the field.

In this context, inland waterway ports are one of the mainstays of the maritime transportation network. The aim of this paper is (1) to model and assess the interdependency between inland port infrastructure and its surrounding supply chain and (2) to show how the disturbance in one will have a ripple effect and trigger cascading failures in the entire network. To comprehend this interconnectedness, we outline three thorough interdependency types: geographic, service provision, and access for repair. After these interdependency types are validated, the factors related to port disruption and its supply chain performance are identified, and the Bayesian network is applied to visualize the interdependency among these factors. The quantification of interdependency is examined, and the results are profoundly analyzed through different advanced techniques such as belief propagation and sensitivity analysis.

We then identify hotspots (the most significant production regions) for primary crops and livestock driven by international consumption. We present the method and data behind this approach, and provide illustrative case studies for Indonesian palm oil and Brazilian soy and beef production. Regionally, China is the largest primary crop consumer, while the EU28 is the largest livestock consumer. Primary crops and livestock hotspots are highly unequal, and the embodied primary crops and livestock for high-income countries are distributed over larger areas when compared to lower-income countries since high-income countries have more numerous trade links.

Case overview/synopsis: Mr Azhar Ali working as a regional distribution manager was waiting for the finalization of sales orders, it was the last working day of the financial year. He had to fulfill all the orders to achieve his personal and organizational goals. He was excited as he was supposed to be promoted and transferred to Head Office on a national role, after a successful annual closing. It was not too late when his excitement turned into anxiety when he received a never expected direct call from Director Sales. Around 7:00 p.m., he was informed of some new orders for an important institutional customer, which was out of his own region. The orders were placed in Ali’s region because of stocks’ availability. Ali had no time to plan this huge order and there were no dispatch trucks available at that time. Should Ali take risk of organizational goals and his promotion and cancel those orders? Should Ali generate sales invoices to record sales and dispatch the stocks on next day compromising the organizational core values and policies? Complexity academic level: BBA.

An intertwined supply network (ISN) is an entirety of interconnected supply chains (SC) which, in their integrity secure the provision of society and markets with goods and services. The ISNs are open systems with structural dynamics since the firms may exhibit multiple behaviours by changing the buyer-supplier roles in interconnected or even competing SCs. From the positions of resilience, the ISNs as a whole provide services to society (e.g. food service, mobility service or communication service) which are required to ensure a long-term survival. The analysis of survivability at the level of ISN requires a consideration at a large scale as resilience of individual SCs. The recent example of coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak clearly shows the necessity of this new perspective. Our study introduces a new angle in SC resilience research when a resistance to extraordinary disruptions needs to be considered at the scale of viability. We elaborate on the integrity of the ISN and viability. The contribution of our position study lies in a conceptualisation of a novel decision-making environment of ISN viability. We illustrate the viability formation through a dynamic game-theoretic modelling of a biological system that resembles the ISN.

144,"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd Ensuring a consistent and regular availability of food is crucial for food security. Food markets, supplied through both domestic production and international trade, are governed by several risks emerging from unpredictable supply chain disruptions, volatility of commodity prices, along with other unforeseen circumstances such as natural disasters. To mitigate the challenges threatening the stability of food systems, decision-making within the food sector should be enhanced and robust to accommodate any changes that might cause food shortages. Dynamic models, that can predict the behavior of food systems in order to avoid potential future knock-on effects and deficits, are incumbent to ensure the sustainable performance of food systems. This study proposes a dynamic decision-making scheme that simulates strategies of the perishable food market under different circumstances. An agent-based model (ABM) is developed and implemented using python MESA library for a case study in Qatar, illustrating the potential performance of tomato under three different scenarios to be considered, namely: (a) baseline scenario - aiming to reflect current production and market conditions; (b) water resource efficiency scenario - basing decisions on crop water requirement (CWR) depending on weather conditions; and (c) economic risk scenario - applying the concept of forward contracts to hedge against future uncertainties in crop prices. The findings of this study demonstrate that under the baseline conditions, a tomato crop can be supplied through a combination of domestic production and imports depending on the available inventories and prices imposed by exporters. The results obtained for the CWR scenario suggest the need for total reliance on imports in order to meet domestic demand, as there is potentially high-water loss, which amounts to an average of 4.9 Billion m3 per year, if tomato is grown locally. In contrast, the results from the forward contract scenario recommend a 57% dependency on local production in order to mitigate the effects of volatility in global food prices, which contributes to a 63% reduction in environmental emissions. Findings of this research provide insight into the factors that influence strategic decision making by the food sector to enhance its economic and environmental performances under diverse circumstances.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.120296,Journal of Cleaner Production,crop water requirement | Food trade | Forward contracts | Nexus | Virtual water,85078698899,Sustainable food security decision-making: An agent-based modelling approach.,2020.0

We further evaluate the role of supply chain risk management practices in mitigating the negative impact of such disruption events. To answer the research question, we conduct a literature review and develop the corresponding hypothesis. We test our hypothesis using both primary and secondary data. The results show that environmental uncertainty has a negative impact on firm financial performance, with entrepreneurial managerial capitalism mediating the impact.

New Radio in the Unlicensed band (NR-U) is a new NR Release 16 mode of operation that has the capability to offer the necessary technology for cellular operators to integrate the unlicensed spectrum into 5G networks. NR-U enables both uplink and downlink operation in unlicensed bands, supporting 5G advanced features of ultra-high-speed, high bandwidth, low latency, and improvement in the reliability of wireless communications, which is essential to address massive-scale and highly-diverse future industrial networks. This paper highlights NR-U as a next-generation communication technology for smart industrial network communication and discusses the technology trends adopted by 5G in support of the Industry 4.0 revolution. However, due to operation in the shared/unlicensed spectrum, NR-U possesses several regulatory and coexistence challenges, limiting its application for operationally intensive environments such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation systems, and energy. Thus, we discuss the significant challenges and potential solution approaches such as shared maximum channel occupancy time (MCOT), handover skipping, the self-organized network (SON), the adaptive back-off mechanism, and the multi-domain coexistence approach to overcome the unlicensed/shared band challenges and boost the realization of NR-U technology in mission-critical industrial applications.

Although supply chain network design under uncertainty has been studied by many researchers, most stochastic programming approaches in this area assume uncertain parameters follow certain distribution functions. However, in practice, the true distributions may be ambiguous and some historical data are available. This study proposes a data-driven two-stage stochastic programming model to obtain robust decisions among all possible distributions in a defined ambiguity set based on the moments of available data. In accordance with the proposed stochastic program, a solution algorithm based on Benders’ decomposition is developed. Further, the social concerns corresponding to the supply chain network are derived and quantified by the social life cycle assessment methodology. The proposed model is applied for designing a recovery network in which various technologies use generated municipal solid wastes for the power generation. Computational results on a real-life case study demonstrate the applicability of the proposed data-driven two-stage stochastic model as well as the impact of considering social concerns on the design decisions.",10.1007/s10479-020-03532-9,Annals of Operations Research,Data driven | Social concerns | Social-life cycle assessment | Supply chain network design | Two-stage stochastic programming,85079729484,A data-driven approach for supply chain network design under uncertainty with consideration of social concerns,2020.0

Also, black swan risks are constantly evolving and can strike from almost anywhere, including natural disaster, cyber risk, or viruses. As more companies are outsourcing their logistics to third-party logistics (3PL), at the same time, supply chain risks and uncertainties are also shifted to 3PLs. A 3PL's supply chain network capability to assure continuity can be expressed in terms of resilience, i.e., the ability of sensing and responding to disturbances or threats. Operations research/management science (OR/MS) methods have been widely applied in supply chain management. The objective of this paper is to look into research regarding the development of resilient 3PL supply chain network designs through the utilization of OR/MS methods. After extensive literature review, a so called pro-silience framework is developed aiming at improving resilience from a 3PL perspective maintaining or increasing its competitive advantage during and after major disruptions, yet also maintain competitiveness under normal operating conditions. Additionally, the framework offers insights into topics for future research.",10.3390/su12104323,Sustainability (Switzerland),Black swan disruptions | Competitive advantage | Literature review; 3PL | OR/MS | Pro-silience | Quantitative models | Resilience | Supply chain network design,85085684916,Towards a pro-silience framework: A literature review on quantitative modelling of resilient 3PL supply chain network designs,2020.0
149,"© 2020 The Authors Cobalt is considered a critical raw material. Global cobalt demand is expected to quadruple in the next four decades, due primarily to lithium-ion battery demand. Uniquely, this study provides detailed geographically explicit data on the cobalt supply chain, with the aim of both determining how susceptible primary cobalt production is to supply chain disruptions, and to evaluate possible supply risks. We conclude that the risks for supply chain disruptions are high. Firstly, the cobalt market is highly concentrated, with more than half of the cobalt mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and almost half of the cobalt refined in China. Secondly, almost all cobalt is mined as a by-product of copper and nickel. Finally, political stability in production countries is considered to be medium to very weak. There are also several factors in play that reduce supply risks. The concentration of the individual mines, refineries and companies remains under the threshold of a concentrated market, and the estimated 80 artisanal cobalt mines further diversify the mined supply. A network analysis shows the important position of companies with high betweenness and degree centrality. A disruption at these companies can affect the functioning of the overall supply chain. The geographic and a network visualization provide useful insights in the supply risks. Based on the analysis, we recommend to diversify cobalt production, through the development of mines, refineries, and efforts to ensure socially and environmentally sustainable artisanal mining.",10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.104743,"Resources, Conservation and Recycling",Cobalt supply risk | Metals criticality | Network analysis | Sustainable resource management,85079157507,Identifying supply risks by mapping the cobalt supply chain,2020.0

In doing so, the paper considers the technical and political challenges of building trust and equity for various stakeholders. A blockchain is a smart electronic database, distributed to all users, immutably tracking every transaction that has ever taken place on the network. The blockchain is very difficult to hack, with no single point of authority to make mistakes and collapse the system. Automated consensus protocols enable data transmitted on the network to be verified and stored immutably, minimising the risk of data corruption to near-zero. Blockchain is being increasingly hyped for a range of services and industries, including transparent resourcing for marine conservation, reducing pollution from plastics, reducing slavery at sea, and sustainable fisheries management. Public distrust in some conservation operations, as well as in the provenance of seafood, is growing. Although some global marine conservation organisations and seafood producers have found practical solutions in disruptive technologies like blockchain, riding this wave will only prove worthwhile if coastal communities and artisanal fishers are on board and stand a chance of landing a fair share of the benefits.",10.1016/j.marpol.2020.103873,Marine Policy,,85079383087,Building trust and equity in marine conservation and fisheries supply chain management with blockchain,2020.0
152,"© 2020 Elsevier Ltd Stable natural-gas supply and reduction of distribution disruptions play a crucial role in the socio-economic wellbeing and support sustainable development. The socio-technical nature of disruption compels implementation of an interdisciplinary perspective using a lens of supply-chain management. In this manner, disruption drivers are present in the internal, network, and environmental categories. Further, a quantitative method is necessary to evaluate and minimize the occurrence and effect of disruptions by promoting capability development. Therefore, natural-gas-supply security (NGSS), as a hierarchical and multi-dimensional construct, is considered to develop these capabilities. The effect of NGSS on mitigating gas-distribution disruptions, which is based on the contingency theory, is investigated to shed light on what a company should do to mitigate disruptions. Structural equation modeling is also applied to analyze the data collected through a survey questionnaire in Tehran Province Gas Company. The results show that NGSS, in the context of disruption mitigation at the company level, consists of three main dimensions: availability, infrastructure, and governance. The findings suggest that availability can be achieved by not only a sufficient supply but also efficient energy use. Further, behavioral and technological changes are essential. In addition, policies and regulations are not sufficient to develop governance; thus, structure, systems, and monitoring should be emphasized. The conclusion of this study provides an empirical basis and some insights into capabilities that aim to mitigate disruptions. These capabilities can provide reinforcement to transparency, trust, risk-management culture, and integrated supply–demand approach to prevent fluctuations in gas availability, thus promoting infrastructure that deals with environmental sustainability and subsequently addresses disruptions.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.120066,Journal of Cleaner Production,Disruption mitigation | Energy security | Gas distribution | Governance | Infrastructure,85077741711,Developing natural-gas-supply security to mitigate distribution disruptions: A case study of the National Iranian Gas Company,2020.0

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is one of the hydrocarbon fuels with the least carbon footprint having a rapidly rising global share in the prime energy market. LNG processing for transportation at longer distances works under cryogenic conditions, especially when used for liquefaction and gasification applications. The supply chain of the eco-environmental friendly hydrocarbon is heavily dependent on the processing plant used for liquefaction and subsequent re-gasification of the natural gas. Plate-fin heat exchangers are extensively used in the LNG industry for both re-gasification as well as liquefaction processes. The exchange of heat during the process of natural gas phase change involves plate-fin heat exchangers working under cryogenic low-temperature conditions. The heat exchangers are designed to have brazed joints that are most vulnerable to failure under these temperature conditions. One failure of such a joint can not only hinder the supply chain but also may result in fire and life hazards. In almost all earlier studies, analytical and numerical methods were used to analyze these braze joints using finite element method methods and examining the stresses while keeping them at or near to ambient conditions. In this research, the plate-fin heat exchanger is investigated for its structural stability of brazed fins for three different fin configurations: plain, wavy and compound having different joint geometries. In addition, the analyses are carried out using experimentally measured brazed joint strength which is measured to be on average 22% lower than the base material strength owing to brazing process and resultant heat-affected zone (HAZ). Therefore, the reliability is assessed for these joints in terms of factor of safety (FOS) while keeping in view the actual yield criteria. It was found that the structural stability of compound fins configuration is weakest amongst all considered fin configurations. The failure of the compound fin brazed joint is expected to be along the horizontal path of the joint due to yielding. The study also predicts the life of the fin brazed joints in different joining directions with different topologies of fins commonly recommended in the literature. It is observed that the commonly recommended safe fin geometries are predicted to be susceptible to failure if a reduction in the brazed joint is considered. The analysis and recommendation in this paper shall provide a reliable and safe design approach for plate-fin exchangers for different operating conditions especially in low to cryogenic temperature applications.",10.3390/en13092175,Energies,ANSYS | Fins | Plate-fin heat exchanger | Structural stability,85084580258,Predicting the structural reliability of LNG processing plate-fin heat exchanger for energy conservation,2020.0

In line with this target, biomass is a promising alternative source for the generation of clean energy and the development of a sustainable society. The use of animal and agricultural wastes is one of the very promising renewable energy alternatives paving the way for a more sustainable energy network. Animal and agricultural wastes as biomass sources do not endanger food security and mitigate environmental impacts and may therefore considerably contribute to an appropriate waste management. As a result, converting animal and agricultural wastes to energy is a challenging issue that has attracted the attention of academic and industrial researchers. A multi-echelon multi-objective model is developed to design a sustainable supply chain for bioenergy generation through the anaerobic digestion process. The model maximizes economic and social objective functions, representing direct economic profits and positive social externalities such as job creation and economic development, respectively. Factors affecting the international supply chain include imports of intermediate production equipment, exports of a final product, international business terms applied, customs duties, and foreign exchange rates. Bioenergy and fertilizers are outputs considered in this study; the former to be converted to electricity in a biogas plant to meet domestic demands, and the latter to be exported. A case study for the Golestan province is used to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed model. The results support the potential for three biogas power plants in Gonbad-e-Kavoos, with an annual production capacity of about 1000 tons of fertilizer and an electricity supply for 101,556 households per month.

Global change, that results from population growth, global warming and land use change (especially rapid urbanization), is directly affecting the complexity of water resources management problems and the uncertainty to which they are exposed. Both, the complexity and the uncertainty, are the result of dynamic interactions between multiple system elements within three major systems: (i) the physical environment; (ii) the social environment; and (iii) the constructed infrastructure environment including pipes, roads, bridges, buildings, and other components. Recent trends in dealing with complex water resources systems include consideration of the whole region being affected, explicit incorporation of all costs and benefits, development of a large number of alternative solutions, and the active (early) involvement of all stakeholders in the decision-making. Systems approaches based on simulation, optimization, and multi-objective analyses, in deterministic, stochastic and fuzzy forms, have demonstrated in the last half of last century, a great success in supporting effective water resources management. This paper explores the future opportunities that will utilize advancements in systems theory that might transform management of water resources on a broader scale.

Accordingly, finding symmetry (balance) among the profit of operation, the environmental effects and customer and supplier service levels is considered in this research.

We study both the economic and environmental sustainability performances under alternative sourcing structures (OS and DS), where we identify a win-win situation.

163,"© 2020 by the authors. Enterprises of the supply chain are currently embedded in dynamic and turbulent environments, having to deal with the appearance of disruptive events. When an enterprise is affected by a disruptive event, the consequences of the disruption not only impact in the enterprise itself, but also influences on the other partners of the network to which it belongs. Thus, disruptive events exceed the capability of individual actors, impacting on the network performance. Consequently, network partners have to collaboratively make decisions to soften the negative impacts on the performance. In this regard, after a disruption takes place, network enterprises should be aware of activating a set of sustainable and resilience strategies that attenuate the performance loss and reduce the disruption recovery time. Nevertheless, the diverse nature of disruptions means that a wide range of varied and sometimes contradictory strategies can be formulated, resulting in conflict situations among the collaborative network (CN) partners. The current paper proposes an approach that makes it possible to collaboratively manage the strategies to activate when a disruptive event occurs, so that the selected strategies are aligned. The strategies alignment approach, proposed in the paper, makes it possible to select those strategies that have a positive impact, or a minimum negative impact, on the objectives defined, not only in the enterprise itself, but also in the objectives defined by the rest of CN partners. The alignment of strategies makes it possible to reduce the performance level loss when a disruption takes place. Thus, the strategies alignment approach aims at activating those strategies that maximize the performance of the CN, achieving levels of performance equal or higher than the levels previous to the disruption, limiting the adverse effects produced by the disruptive events, and contributing to a more sustainable-resilient CN. Finally, in order to validate the proposal, a case study is presented. The proposed model is validated to deal with a drop in demand due to a political embargo, in a textile CN.",10.3390/su12072641,Sustainability (Switzerland),Disruption recovery management | Resilient collaborative network | Strategies alignment | Sustainable collaborative network | Systems dynamic method,85083658891,A strategies alignment approach to manage disruptive events in collaborative networks,2020.0

The Finnish forest industry is committed to applying novel technologies for increasing carbon-neutral development and environmental sustainability in ""green"" circular industry. This study compares the energy efficiency indicators of road freight transportation. Additionally, effects of four mass limits of vehicle combinations are analyzed after a three-year adaptation process that took place in a wood procurement region of 100% renewable resources. The wood-based energy efficiency model (load's wood energy/fossil transport energy) was the most accurate and precise measure as the development indicator. The indicator showed that the transportation systems (60, 64, 68, and 76 t) and (64, 68, and 76 t) were carbon negative (122, 133, 144, and 108) (142, 147, and 133) in 2014 and 2016, respectively. The numbers reveal positive energy ratio of renewable wood and fossil fuels. In comparison to 60 t, the use of 68 t vehicles increased energy efficiency most effectively in the systems, by 18.0% and 20.5%, respectively. The indicator robustly revealed the energy efficiency of a partial system in the smaller supply region, which depended on the region's transportation conditions. This novel knowledge can be applied for advancing the adaptation toward carbon-neutral supply networks.

165,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd Biomass polygeneration system is one of the most attractive biomass technologies due to its technicality, feasibility and high associated investment returns. The synthesis, design and economic aspects of constructing a processing system using this technology are well-developed and have recently reached the stage of industrial implementation. Nonetheless, the early stage of technology development focuses on process and product safety and tends to ignore other risk aspects that are closely associated with the biomass value chain. Due to the complex nature of the biomass value chain, conventional risk mitigation strategies are ineffective in mitigating risks at the management level. More recent approaches, particularly stochastic programming methods, have yielded robust results in addressing technological risks and design uncertainties. However, such approaches are still unable to effectively consider non-quantitative risks such as business risks and regulatory risks. Hence, this study proposes a combined method of an analytical model and stochastic programming approach to prioritize risks and risk mitigation strategies for decision-making purposes. This work presents a novel multiple-criteria decision-making expert system based on fuzzy set theory, which is the Decision and Evaluation-based Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (DEFANP) method. The novel method functions to prioritize risk mitigation strategies within a network relationship of project goals, key components of the biomass industry and industrial stakeholders. As the stochastic risk mitigation counterpart, the fluctuations and uncertainties in operations, transportation, market supply-demand and price are modeled using the Monte Carlo simulation method. From this, risks of implementing biomass polygeneration systems can be mitigated by selecting a strategy that yields the highest analytical indicator while reconciling with the corresponding probabilities of achieving management goals.

This study puts forth an empirically supported integrative framework to understand supply chain flexibility from market-oriented and network-oriented perspectives, interrelationships among its dimensions and the effect of supply chain complexity as a contingent factor. Design/methodology/approach: The online survey data were collected from 201 manufacturing companies and checked for common method variance, validity and reliability. Structural equation modeling was then used to test the hypotheses. Findings: The results of this study demonstrate that there are interrelationships among market-oriented and network-oriented supply chain flexibility dimensions. It is the flexibility embedded in the supply chain network configuration that plays critical roles in superior performance in flexibility capabilities to create customer values. The interrelated effect among flexibility dimensions is contingent on the magnitude of the supply chain complexity corresponding to the number of supply chain tiers. Originality/value: This study takes a step to advance understanding of supply chain flexibility from an integrative point of view consisting of market-oriented and network-oriented perspectives.

There are various uncertain parameters in real world that if ignored may greatly affect the optimal configuration of the designed biodiesel supply chain. Scenario planning is a powerful tool which can help the decision makers for long-term planning under uncertainties. Therefore, in this paper, a scenario-based robust optimization model is presented for designing the biodiesel supply chain networks under uncertainties. Some of the parameters including demand, supply, costs, and environmental impacts have uncertain nature. For the first time, in this study, the values of these uncertain parameters are estimated by a proposed scenario-planning method. The presented scenario-planning approach is based on cross-impact analysis and visualization methods. Non-edible sources such as Jatropha, Norouzak, and waste cooking oil are considered as raw materials of biodiesel production, and for the first time Norouzak has been used as one of the sources in designing biodiesel supply chain. In addition, an environmental constraint is considered and the environmental impacts of all processes are obtained by Eco-indicator 99 method. The presented model can determine the number, location, and capacity of the facilities. The proposed model is implemented in a real case study in Iran for a 7-year planning horizon.

Circular economy is an alternative to the traditional production model and has therefore attracted a great deal of attention fromresearchers. The change in the production system is accompanied by new logistical needs related both to resources and waste and to the distribution and recovery of products. The circular supply chain involves return processes and the manufacturer intends to capture additional value in the supply chain. In this paper, value chains have been mapped to visualize the links and interactions between the different stages and actors to understand the complexities of these systems and to make informed decisions. For this reason, and based on thorough literature review, the final objective of this work is to achieve a conceptual framework to study circular supply chain, which uses the main theoretical perspectives in strategic management literature. Four dimensions have been identified to support the development of these new supply chains-greater intensity in the relationships established in the supply chain, adaptation of logistics and organizational, disruptive and smart technologies, and a functioning environment. It can be concluded that to develop a new relationship capacity will allow for reaching more frequent, closer relationships with more actors. These relationships will be developed within an adapted organizational and logistical framework that is framed in new business model archetypes.

172,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd We develop a sustainability performance measurement framework for supplier evaluation and selection, using the Analytic Network Process (ANP) method. Even though the literature is rife with studies that deal with the supplier selection problem, companies that actively pursue sustainability strategies may need to add metrics that show suppliers’ sustainability performance. Existing models for measuring sustainability performance are limited in that they either evaluate the environmental and social performance separately, do not consider the inter-relationships between metrics across the three dimensions of sustainability, or utilize metrics that are difficult to obtain and evaluate accurately. To overcome this deficiency, we use the ANP method, that takes into account the interrelations between quantifiable and easy to obtain sustainability-related evaluation metrics. First, through an extensive literature review and feedback from an experts’ panel, we select and classify salient sustainability performance metrics related to supplier evaluation. With data collected through an extensive survey amongst 144 supply chain professionals in the UK and France, we develop the interdependencies between several sustainability metrics and determine the most critical metrics by calculating their relative weights. Results show that the selected socio-economic metrics carry the most relatively important role in supplier selection. Based on the findings of the study, we discuss implications for theory and practice. The proposed evaluation system can provide details on observing sustainable supply chain performance. It can also help to get a clearer insight into sustainability with a well-established quantitative decision-making process so that business strategies can be developed with more concerns on supply chain sustainability.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119439,Journal of Cleaner Production,Analytical network process | Sustainability performance | Sustainable supplier selection,85076309908,Supplier sustainability performance evaluation using the analytic network process,2020.0

The production and recycling of shared bicycles are a closed logistics network, which can be considered a typical closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) problem. In practice, the CLSC network is influenced by social, economic and environmental factors, which impose high degrees of uncertainty and usually trigger various unanticipated risks, so controlling uncertain parameters becomes a key issue in supply chain decisions. The purpose of this research is to construct a new distributionally robust optimization model for a multi-product, multi-echelon CLSC network, in which the distributions of uncertain transportation cost, demand and the returned product are only partially known in advance. In the proposed model, robust mean-CVaR optimization formulation is employed as the objective function for a trade-off between the expected cost and the risk in the CLSC network. Further, to overcome the obstacle of model solvability resulting from imprecise probability distributions, two kinds of ambiguity sets are used to transform the robust counterpart into its computationally tractable forms. Finally, a case study on a Chinese bicycle-sharing company is addressed to validate the proposed robust optimization model.

These substances, restricted by law or company policy, are in focus for chemicals management processes by textile retailers. However, complex and non-transparent supply chains, and limited chemical knowledge, makes chemicals management challenging. Therefore, a function-based approach for life cycle management (LCM) of chemicals was developed, based on results of previous projects and evaluated using a two-step Delphi process. The resulting approach aims to help retailers identify and substitute hazardous substances in products, and consists of three parts: (i) a function-based chemicals management concept model for different levels of chemical information within the supply chain, (ii) tools for non-chemists which explain chemical information, and (iii) a continuous provision of knowledge to stakeholders (e.g., retailers) in a network. This approach is successfully implemented by over 100 retailers in the Nordic countries, providing the textile industry with practical and robust tools to manage and substitute hazardous chemicals in products and production processes.

Purpose: This paper aims to design an optimal supply chain network and to develop a suitable distribution planning under uncertainty for perishable product's supply chain. The ultimate goal is to help in making decisions under uncertain environments. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, stochastic programming is used under conditions of demand, supply and process uncertainties, and a non-linear mathematical model is developed for perishable product’s supply chain. Authors’ study considers disruptions in transportation routes and also within the facilities and investigates optimal facility location and shipment decisions while minimising the total supply chain cost. A scenario-based approach is used to model these disruptions. The retailer level uncertainty due to demand-supply mismatch is handled by incorporating the newsvendor model into the last echelon of supply chain network. In this paper, two policies are proposed for making decisions under uncertain environments. In the first one, the expected cost of the supply chain is minimised. To also consider the risk behaviour of the decision maker, authors propose the second policy through a conditional value-at-risk approach. Findings: Authors discuss the model output through various examples that are provided via a case study from the milk industry. The supply chain design and planning of the disruption-free model are different from those of the resilient model.

Despite past and ongoing efforts, the available methods often overlook impacts beyond climate change or incorporate them via standard life cycle assessment metrics that are hard to interpret from an absolute sustainability viewpoint. We here address the design of biomass supply chains considering critical ecological limits of the Earth—planetary boundaries—which should never be surpassed by anthropogenic activities. Our method relies on a mixed-integer linear program that incorporates a planetary boundaries-based damage model to quantify absolute sustainability precisely. We apply this approach to the sugarcane-to-ethanol industry in Argentina, identifying the optimal combination of technologies and network layout that minimize the impact on these ecological boundaries.

Nowadays, oil price fluctuation, fossil fuel depletion, and the potential environmental impact of these energy resources are highly threatening the global economy. Developing renewable resources, hence, is quite unavoidable. Sugarcane, as a source of renewable energy, can be converted to bioethanol. Therefore, this study has proposed a mixed-integer linear programming to design an international network of the sugarcane-to-biofuel supply chain. To deal with uncertainty, the robust optimization approach is employed in order to maximize the profit earned from the bioethanol sales at the foreign/domestic markets, minimize the environmental impacts caused by these supply chain activities, and maximize this network generated employment. The multi-echelon supply chain model involves different production/storage capacities, bio-refineries technologies, and transportation modes. This supply chain configuration has specified the optimal production capacity/technology, the appropriate transportation mode in each route, and the bio-refineries’ development capacities. The biofuel export price and the domestic/foreign markets’ demands are among the SC uncertain parameters addressed through the robust possibilistic programming. Finally, the tri-objective model has been solved using an approach that considers the decision maker’s preferences; the model performance has been verified by a case study performed in Iran.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming model to address the design and planning of a multi-feedstock lignocellulosic bioethanol supply chain network. In order to provide resiliency against existing epistemic uncertainties and disruption risks in the supply chain, a hybrid robust stochastic-possibilistic programming approach is employed. The proposed model minimizes total expected cost of the supply chain over non-disruption and disruption scenarios while limiting greenhouse gas emissions for sustainability considerations. The model determines the optimal supply chain strategic and tactical decision variables such as location, capacity and technology of biorefineries, transportation modes, shipments, inventory levels and production and import amounts. The performance of the model is evaluated through a real case study developed in Iran. Comparing the proposed resilient model with its non-resilient counterpart reveals that the proposed model is superior both in cost and GHG emissions reductions.

To develop the mathematical model, two additional and essential dimensions of the supply chain including social impact and resiliency are simultaneously considered. This model is the integration of several proper indicators of resiliency, social responsibility dimensions through considering three objective functions to minimize the cost, non-resiliency, and negative impacts of social responsibility.

Imposition of strict environmental protection acts and the imperative need of the best possible allocation of resources have given birth to the concept of low carbon logistics. Environmental laws force the manufacturers to extend their existing supply chains to form a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) through the setup of an efficient recovery system. In this paper, a multi-objective robust optimisation model is proposed for the design of CLSC network under uncertainty. First, a deterministic bi-objective mixed integer linear programming (BOMILP) model is developed for designing a CLSC network. Then, the robust counterpart of the proposed BOMILP is presented to cope with the real-world uncertainty. The first objective aims to maximise the total profit generated in the CLSC network and the second objective minimises the environmental pollution of the CLSC network.

This kind of environment requires consideration of the economical aspects, the technical aspects, the safety/quality of supply, and consumer preferences. The major contributions introduced in the presented approach are the following. A nonlinear formulation is adopted to capture the nonlinear thermal models and the nonlinear algebraic model of the heat supply network. The second major contribution is the economic character of the objective following the assumption of a liberalized market environment.

In recent years, due to governmental legislation, environmental groups’ pressures, customer green expectation, etc., closed-loop green supply chains have gained paramount consideration. Accordingly, this study develops a novel multi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming model for a closed-loop green supply chain network design problem. The proposed model aims to minimize the total costs, total CO2 emissions, and robustness costs in both forward and reverse directions, simultaneously. To cope with flexible constraints and epistemic uncertainty in the model’s parameters, a robust flexible-possibilistic programming approach is tailored. The model is solved using an efficient interactive solution approach, in which, the presented model is analyzed under various carbon emission mechanisms to assess the influence of these mechanisms on the achieved solution. An illustrative example in the copier industry is also provided to validate the applicability of the presented optimization model.

Purpose: This paper aims to evaluate the collaboration quality performance of sugar company Z and its stakeholders (farmers and distributors) by considering the sustainability aspects. This assessment shall be able to integrate qualitative and quantitative factors in the model, which is critical in sugar supply chains involving multi-stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach: Integration of quality function deployment (QFD), the fuzzy analytical network process (FANP) and the data envelopment analysis (DEA) is administered to assess the efficiency score of each stakeholder involved. The evaluation encompasses collaboration behaviour factors since the input of collaboration activities will result in sustainability aspects such as revenue, green house gas (GHG) emissions and social impact. The analysis has been conducted in two scenarios, those are the basic scenario by utilising original data and the extended scenario by using projection data. Findings: The result clarifies that the most influential behaviour factor in the collaboration activities is commitment (0.116), while the least important behaviour factors are power (0.008) and adaptation (0.008). Furthermore, by using the extended scenario, the overall efficiency for each benchmarking is higher compared to the condition before the improvement (basic scenario). Research limitations/implications: The result of this study is only relevant to the particular sugar supply chain and involving limited sustainability variables. Therefore, in a further study, more variables such as technical and financial aspects could be explored further in the assessment process. Practical implications: The result of this study is available for each stakeholder and can be fundamental for the constant improvement in sustainable supply chain (SSC) practices. It shows that an improvement of one stakeholder will positively impact the entire system. Social implications: Smallholders and sugarcane farmers will recognise the significance of collaboration behaviour. Thus, they can enhance their mutual benefits by using the existing resources. Originality/value: This paper arranges for a practical contribution by implementing advanced assessment methods in the sugar supply chain by taking into account the economic, environmental and social aspects. This comprehensive assessment process in the sugar supply chain is the novelty of this paper.",10.1108/IJPPM-11-2019-0527,International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management,Collaboration | Data envelopment analysis | Fuzzy analytic network process | Quality function deployment | Sugar supply chain | Sustainability,85097076297,The assessment of collaboration quality: a case of sugar supply chain in Indonesia,2020.0

This paper proposes a new multi objective model in the area of closed loop supply chain problem integrated with lot sizing by considering lean, agility and sustainability factors simultaneously. In this regard, responsiveness, environmental, social and economic aspects are regarded in the model in addition to the capacity and service-level constraints. Most importantly, strategic and operational backup decisions are developed to increase the resiliency of the system against disruption of the facilities and routes simultaneously. In the following, a new hybrid metaheuristic algorithm comprised a parallel Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (PMOPSO) algorithm and a multi objective social engineering optimizer (MOSEO) is developed to deal with large size problems efficiency.

One of the general requirements of medical treatments of field hospitals in disaster is blood transfusion. This way, configuring a blood transfusion network to handle the appropriate assignments and distribution is proved to influence the type, number and severity of recent crises. Therefore, obtaining effective solutions, containing determining the optimal location of facilities of field hospitals, identifying the optimal capacity of facilities and transportation, blood transfusion routes to reduce costs and injustices in this area in times of crisis is essential. Hence, in this study, we proposed a model, intend for allocating blood types and regarding the lifetime of blood to tackle with field hospitals in the disaster sites. Furthermore, the coverage of the demand for blood types for the establishment of field hospitals and the balanced distribution of blood between these hospitals from the blood collection level to the establishment of field hospitals with optimal routing of blood transfusion at the lowest cost is considered. The proposed model for the crisis response management phase is modelled applying a multi-objective mathematical model under uncertain conditions. To cope with the uncertain data arisen in the disaster condition, the robust optimization approach is applied. Then, to solve the proposed model, a hybrid method based on Genetic Algorithm and Multi-Choice Goal Programming (GAMCGP) under uncertainty is developed. In addition, the proposed model is successfully applied to a real- world blood supply chain in Mazandaran, northern part of Iran, and the results validate the performance of the proposed model. It also proves that the suggested model can be considered as a new approach for blood supply chain tactical management in the crisis logistics.",10.1080/01605682.2020.1821586,Journal of the Operational Research Society,blood supply chain | Genetic Algorithm Multi-Choice Goal Programming (GAMCGP) | lifetime of blood | location and routing | Robust optimization,85094887263,A robust optimization model of the field hospitals in the sustainable blood supply chain in crisis logistics,2020.0

Photovoltaic Solar Energy (PSE) sector has sparked great interest from governments over the last decade towards diminution of world’s dependency to fossil fuels, greenhouse gas emissions reduction and global warming mitigation. Photovoltaic solar energy also holds a significant role in the transition to sustainable energy systems. These systems and their optimal exploitation require an effective supply chain management system, such as design of the network, collection, storage, or transportation of this energy resource, without disregarding a country’s certain socio-economic and political conditions. In Brazil, the adoption of photovoltaic solar energy has been motivated not only by the energy matrix diversification but also from the shortages, problems, and barriers that the Brazilian energy sector has faced, lately. However, PSE development is affected by various factors with high uncertainty, such as political, social, economic, and environmental, that include critical operational sustainability issues. Thus, an elaborate modelling of energy management and a well-structured decision support process are needed to enhance the performance efficiency of Brazilian PSE supply chain management. This study focuses on the investigation of certain factors and their influence on the development of the Brazilian PSE with the help of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps. Fuzzy Cognitive Map is an established methodology for scenario analysis and management in diverse domains, inheriting the advancements of fuzzy logic and neural networks. In this context, a semi-quantitative model was designed with the help of various stakeholders from the specific energy domain and three plausible scenarios were conducted in order to support a decision-making process on PSE sector development and the country’s economic potential. The outcome of this analysis reveals that the development of the PSE sector in Brazil is mainly affected by economic and political factors.",10.3390/en13061427,Energies,Decision-support | Energy management | Fuzzy Cognitive Maps | Photovoltaic solar energy | Scenario analysis,85082664850,Decision-making process for photovoltaic solar energy sector development using fuzzy cognitive map technique,2020.0

There is a growing scientific interest and public debate on the potential contributions that Local Food Systems (LFS) and Short Food Supply Chains (SFSCs) can make towards overcoming sustainability challenges and creating societal impact. In the case of Turkey, where local agricultural systems are particularly vulnerable, lacking of resilience and innovative capacity, understanding the governance mechanisms of SFSCs would have strong implications for policy making. To this end, our aim in this study is to explore the mechanisms through which civil society driven SFSCs are governed in the city of Izmir (Turkey), referring to the actors involved in the process, institutional frameworks that are adopted and challenges experienced, that could inform policy discussions towards establishing more sustainable local food systems. In this direction, the questions we aim to answer are: (1) what are the mechanisms through which community level SFSCs are initiated and governed, (2) how collaboration takes place within these groups and through which processes, and finally (3) what the outcomes of these processes are, with respect to individual, community and local impacts experienced on the ground, and challenges associated with them. We use a descriptive case study methodology, to study seven SFSC initiatives (four food community networks, two farmers’ markets and a local shop) in the city of Izmir; and collect data through qualitative semi-structured in-depth interviews (41 with producers, 32 with consumers, 11 with coordinators and 5 with experts). Our findings suggest that different mechanisms are at play within our cases, depending on aspects including their governing structures and their way and purpose of operation. While farmers had difficulties relying solely on their income from these initiatives for their livelihoods, organizational challenges experienced by food communities were mainly related to difficulties associated to managing tasks on a voluntary basis. Moreover, arriving at a shared understanding about mutual goals, in addition to finding a way to include stakeholders in the process, were among the most prevalent challenges of all initiatives.",10.13128/bae-8242,Bio-based and Applied Economics,Alternative food networks | Collaborative governance | Governance challenges | Local food systems | Short food supply chains,85101324560,"Exploring governance mechanisms, collaborative processes and main challenges in short food supply chains: The case of turkey",2020.0
215,"© 2020 COVID-19 has imposed significant detrimental effects on the global hospitality sector. These effects have primarily been considered from the socio-economic perspective, ignoring the implications of the pandemic for the environmental performance of hospitality services. By drawing upon emerging evidence from various academic and non-academic sources, this conceptual paper critically evaluates the implications of the preventative and protective measures adopted against COVID-19 for the generation of the hospitality sector's food and plastic waste. The implications are divided into direct and indirect and considered through the prism of temporality of their anticipated occurrence (immediate, short-term and medium-term perspective). The paper proposes potential strategies to aid in the management of these wastes in the hospitality sector in a post-pandemic world. To address the issue of food waste, the hospitality sector should be integrated into alternative food networks (AFNs) and short food supply chains (SFSCs). Business coopetition between hospitality enterprises and other actors of the food supply chain is necessary for the success of such integration. To address the issue of plastic waste, the hospitality sector should invest in ‘green’ innovation. This investment needs to be encouraged and supported by targeted policy interventions. The paper argues that these strategies are critical not only in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, but will also remain valid for the sustained development of the hospitality sector in light of future disastrous events, especially climate change. The paper discusses the institutional and organisational prerequisites for the effective implementation of these strategies and highlights the related research opportunities.",10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.105272,"Resources, Conservation and Recycling",Business coopetition | COVID-19 pandemic | Food waste | Plastic waste | Solid waste | ‘Green’ innovation,85096117414,The prospects of waste management in the hospitality sector post COVID-19,2020.0

These issues are inevitable and interrelated. The issues produce undesirable cascading effects that make performance measurement complicated. This paper aims to identify and model the critical barriers in the HSC. Design/methodology/approach: The study identifies 17 barriers through the relevant literature and interviews with the stakeholders related to humanitarian organization (HO) in the developing economy. The barriers have been identified from strategic, technological, organizational, economic and operational point of view. Further, the barriers were ranked based on the degree of influence using the grey analytic network process (ANP) approach. The interrelationship among the influential barriers is established through modified total interpretive structural modelling (mTISM). To analyse and demonstrate the iterative consensus among the stakeholders, kappa statistics was adopted. Findings: The barriers have been ranked to determine their extent of influence and modelled to reveal the interrelationship among them. The issues concerned with skills of personnel are the most influential barrier. Other three critical barriers identified are: chaotic operative environment, conflicting objectives of HO and lack of funding for information technology (IT) infrastructure. Appropriate funds need to be allocated towards IT infrastructure and personnel training. Originality/value: Both quantitative and qualitative performance measurement frameworks had been proposed earlier for HSC. However, limited literature addresses the implementation issues with the available frameworks. This study advances the knowledge on performance measurement barriers of HSC and develops a functional description to identify the critical role of performance measurement in HOs.

This paper seeks to develop a reliable network of cross-docks by taking in to account disruption and reliability issues to hedge against heterogeneous risk of cross-docking failure. In real environments, applying a recovery policy can be a feasible strategy to handle disruptions. Hence, in this study, a recovery policy has been addressed in the form of reallocating suppliers to alternative cross-docks or altering the transportation strategy to move shipments. In addition to cross-dock location design, the optimum capacity of opened cross-docks will be determined considering the loads that will be served by each cross-docking center under regular and disruption conditions. A mixed integer nonlinear programming formulation is presented for the problem and is then linearized to present an efficient model. In order to solve it, two Lagrangian relaxation algorithms are designed and tested on 40 problem instances with different values of parameters. The results achieved by GAMS/CPLEX are compared with those of two algorithms and some analyses are performed on the solutions. Moreover, as the case study, the focus has been placed on logistic part of a car-manufacturing company with a vast supply chain network, containing more than 600 suppliers. The logistic strategies have been applied in order to reduce the transportation cost through the supply chain network and diminish the disruption subsequences in such a network.

Low water depth has a major impact on the loading capacity of inland ships, and as a consequence on the transport capacity of the overall waterborne supply chain. Individual ship owners have detailed knowledge on how much the draught of their ship and the associated cargo weight should be reduced to adapt to low water. These parameters are even adjusted as a function of environmental circumstances (e.g. composition of the riverbed) and type of cargo. This detailed knowledge is, however, not accessible at an aggregated level to assess the effects on the overall transport capacity of an inland waterway transport network. Based on a range of field observations and information collected from individual ships, this article introduces a general model to define the effect of low water constraints on the deadweight and payload of inland ships, for which only the type, length, and beam of the vessel serve as mandatory input. Availability of a general model of the capacity reducing effect of lowered water depth is important for the design and operation of robust transport chains on the one hand, and for the optimisation of fairway maintenance and long-term infrastructure development on the other.",10.18757/ejtir.2020.20.3.3981,European Journal of Transport and Infrastructure Research,Deadweight | Draft | Inland shipping | Payload | Water depth,85091336396,The effect of low water on loading capacity of inland ships,2020.0

CSC is also known to be energy intensive with a significant emission footprint. As a result, CSC requires strict monitoring and control management system during storage and transportation to improve safety and reduce profit losses. In this research, a systematic review of recent literature related to the distribution of food CSC products is presented and possible areas to extend research in modeling and decision-making are identified. Design/methodology/approach: The paper analyzes the content of 65 recent articles related to CSC and perishable foods. Several relevant keywords were used in the initial search, which generated a list of 214 articles. The articles were screened based on content relevance in terms of food vehicle routing modeling and quality. Selected articles were categorized and analyzed based on cost elements, modeling framework and solution approach. Finally, recommendations for future research are suggested. Findings: The review identified several research gaps in CSC logistics literature, where more focused research is warranted. First, the review suggests that dynamic vehicle modeling and routing while considering products quality and environmental impacts is still an open area for research. Second, there is no consensus among researchers in terms of quality degradation models used to assess the freshness of transported cold food. As a result, an investigation of critical parameters and quality modeling is warranted. Third, and due to the problem complexity, there is a need for developing heuristics and metaheuristics to solve such models. Finally, there is a need for extending the single product single compartment CSC to multi-compartment multi-temperature routing modeling.

Each delivery batch has a capacity and incurs a delivery cost. There is a situation that a possible disruption in the production part may occur at some particular time and will last for a period of time with a probability. We consider both resumable case and nonresumable case where a job does not need (needs) to restart if it is disrupted for a resumable (nonresumable) case. The objective is to find a coordinated schedule of production and delivery that minimizes the expected total flow times plus the delivery costs.

The data privacy is preserved by dividing the blockchain network into various channels, where every channel comprises a finite number of authorized organizations and processes a specific type of data such as health, smart car, smart energy or financial details. Moreover, access to users’ data within a channel is controlled by embedding access control rules in the smart contracts.

Among the critical issues that have emerged significantly in recent weeks, the crisis in the procurement of antiCovid sanitary material is of great importance, characterized by delays, lack of supplies, prices out of control, difficulties in finding uniform material throughout the national territory. In our opinion, these “inconveniences” are evidence of a lack of “governance capacity” which characterizes the purchasing processes of medical material as a whole and which also characterized the model chosen to meet the need for supplies pending the pandemic. Phase 2 of the health system, and above all of the procurement chain, requires first of all to reflect on the new political agenda of the health system, restoring the correct order of priorities: • health protection, as well as health education policies, represent the essential conditions for long-term economic and social sustainability; • the health policy choices must take into account the consequences in terms of sustainability of the supply markets, the presence of local suppliers, the implications of any opportunistic behavior of private operators; • institutional collaboration, and not the opposition, between multiple levels of government, between citizens and institutions, between political forces, is fundamental for overcoming emergency situations and for reinventing systems for responding to complex and often unpredictable needs. With specific reference to procurement, supply chains and their complexity must be revisited, paying greater attention to factors such as (a) location of key suppliers, (b) reliability of suppliers (e.g. vendor rating), (c) availability of sources alternative qualified procurement, (d) ability of suppliers to operate during an emergency even for long periods.",10.3280/MESA2020-113014,Mecosan,Public procurement | Supply chain governance | Vendor rating,85090597520,Beyond the miracle of emergency.

226,"© The Author(s) 2020. The Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy and the Committee on Climate Change place high dependency on the electrification of heat and use of heat pump systems to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Energy efficient buildings are essential for effective heat pump operation. However, the UK’s housing stock is amongst the least energy efficient in Europe. Household electricity demand will increase with heat pump use, meaning reinforcement to infrastructure and generation capacity. This study uses dynamic simulation modelling to determine the optimum energy efficient retrofit required to minimise energy use and electrical demand for an average semi-detached dwelling using a heat pump. Solid wall insulation is found to be critical in energy abatement, although the heat pump operates at a high demand compared with low voltage network design. A whole house retrofit in-line with current Building Regulations reduces the heating demand and emissions by 65%, and lowers the input electrical demand for the heat pump to under 1 kW. Solid wall insulation and low U-value glazing are the cost-optimal solution, achieving similar abatement. Measures that exceed building regulations are shown to lower heat demand and carbon emissions by almost 80%, highlighting scope for improvement in retrofit standards. Practical application: At present, UK policy makers have a preferred alternative to high carbon fossil fuels that is a system heavily reliant on heat pumps powered by low carbon electricity.

227,"© 2020 China Agricultural University For small farmers wishing to sell their products under the “local agriculture” marketing concept, connecting with consumers can be challenging. One approach to mitigating this disconnect between where production occurs and where consumers reside is through a network of regional consolidation points. In this study, we utilize optimization models to assist the Missouri Coalition of Environment (MCE) in helping farmers from Missouri and Illinois route products from their farms to a central hub in St. Louis. The aim of this study was to minimize the ton-miles traveled by farmers and MCE vehicles in delivering agricultural products from farms to regional hubs to the central hub. Given historical data about variability of plant and animal production in the Greater Plains region, a robust optimization approach was incorporated to increase the likelihood that the network can accommodate uncertainty in agricultural production. GAMS/CPLEX was used to solve the model under different configurations and identify potential locations for regional hubs. Computational testing determined that the capacity of hubs plays a key role in the optimal assignments: given the assumed model constraint that farmers can travel only to their nearest regional hub, solutions may sacrifice a better objective function value in order to accommodate farmers’ travel requirements.",10.1016/j.inpa.2020.09.004,Information Processing in Agriculture,Optimization | Robustness and sensitivity analysis | Supply chain management,85092216325,Network design for local agriculture using robust optimization,2020.0

Several LNG-fueled vessels are already operating, and the LNG market is expected to grow further in the next years. A capillary marine LNG infrastructure network is developing to strengthen the fuel supply chain, which includes smallscale LNG storage and bunkering installations. However, safety remains a crucial aspect for the expansion of sustainable and reliable LNG technologies due to flammability hazards of natural gas. Storage tanks are vulnerable units from a safety point of view: External fires might affect LNG tanks leading to their catastrophic failure with a possibility of accident escalation. The present contribution aims at the evaluation of thermal response of storage tanks exposed to high levels of thermal radiation from distant sources, such as a pool fires generated after the ignition of LNG spills. A two-dimension computational fluid dynamic (CFD) approach is applied to predict tank pressurization rate and temperature distribution for a set of case studies. The results obtained give insight about the dynamic response of pressurized cryogenic vessels involved in process accidents, providing a useful contribution to emergency response planning as well as identifying important safety aspects regarding LNG storage and distribution chain.",10.3303/CET2082063,Chemical Engineering Transactions,,85094210857,LNG Tanks exposed to distant pool fires: A cfd study,2020.0

In today's challenging and dynamic business environment, popularly referred to as VUCA short for volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity, SMEs need to continually adapt and adopt technological solutions to stay competitive. Cloud computing is a disruptive information and communication technology (ICT) tool, which can be leveraged by SMEs for this purpose. However widespread adoption of cloud computing in SMEs is elusive. In this paper, we analyse the attributes that influence the adoption of cloud computing in SMEs using techniques like importance performance analysis (IPA), analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy-AHP. IPA technique is used to identify the areas of improvement for service providers as also improve their efficiency. AHP technique has been used to rank different attributes of the technology in the order of preference from an SME's perspective.

The complexity of the situation has resulted in the emergence of various models encompassing important factors of threat neutralization. Various characteristics of airborne threats considered important for their assessment have already been identified in previous literature, which include speed, distance, approach angle, maneuverability, and so on. Due to the possible extent of loss to critical assets, literature has emphasized on identifying as many useful characteristics of threats as possible. This study is also a step in this direction to improve the weapon assignment for threat neutralization. Weapon assignment based on a well-calculated threat index is a key to success in military conflicts. The purpose of this article is to identify new factors through the involvement of experts. In this study, a set of factors has been identified through a survey of relevant literature and semi-structured interviews followed by its refinement through a three-round Delphi study. The results suggest that airborne threats are considered different from other threats due to their lethality and consequences. The top-level decision-makers require a comprehensive understanding of the criticality of the situation and the effects of poor decisions. Besides other factors, weapon stock, supply chain information, and analysis of vulnerable assets/points in threat neutralization are critical to accomplish higher efficiency.

Complexity modelling of economic efficiency and growth potential is increasingly essential for countries and provinces. Evaluating the monetary flows, kinetic energy (efficiency) and potential capacity (resilience) provides crucial information for economic development. In the paper, the authors analyze growth opportunities for the Chinese economy from a system science point of view, using the perspective of information entropy, based on the input-output tables. Over the past four decades of reform and opening-up, China has made remarkable progress in its economic development. In 2007, China's GDP was at its fastest pace in history at 14.2% growth. However, after the financial crisis in 2008, the global economy experienced a downward trend and China's economic development also settled on a medium-low level of development. The traditional perspective is to rank regional development only based on GDP growth, whereas here, the authors advocate another evaluation method based on efficiency and potential growth. Unbalanced regional economic development has become problematic and has become a barrier for sustainability of China's economy. The results of the research indicate firstly that China's regional development in 2007 and 2012 has been unequal between the provinces. Secondly, the authors found that Shandong province had significantly higher indicators for efficiency and potential growth than others in the same circumstances. Authors observe that provinces tend to carry out industrial policies and adjust the structure of industry on a local level. This analysis demonstrates that the spatial imbalance of efficiency and potential of economic development under the perspective of provincial-level regions. From the perspective of industry, it indicates that the supply chain is too short, mainly focusing on the mining and processing of resources and minerals in the original upstream industry chain, while the downstream is not fully utilized. These represent some unique insights yielded through this type of analysis that authors advocate applying more broadly.",10.1371/journal.pone.0227206,PLoS ONE,,85078687898,Complexity theory for the modern Chinese economy from an information entropy perspective: Modeling of economic efficiency and growth potential,2020.0

The study is further trying to illustrate an approach for analyzing the relative intensities of these risks in the present uncertain business environment. Design/methodology/approach: Risk on the overall demand is assessed by a combined Bayesian – multi-criteria decision-making approach. Data related to the different factors, affecting their product demand is collected from major automobile firms. Then, weights for these factors are evaluated by applying the analytic hierarchy process approach. Further, these weights are used in the Bayesian analysis network to evaluate the risk intensity for different subgroups, namely, political, economic, social, technological and environmental. Findings: From the literature and experts’ opinion, total 16 risk factors have been finalized and these are further grouped into 5 categories i.e. political, economic, social, technological and environmental. It is observed that the demand for organizations functioning in the automotive sector is more vulnerable to economic risk as compared to other risks considered in the study. Practical implications: Managers and decision makers of associated organizations can use the proposed framework to assess the demand risks so as to pre-evaluate their demand corresponding to future changes. Factors can be added or removed and importance could be assigned to different risk factors according to the prevailing business environment for an organization or sector. This will also help the organizations to conduct a more effective risk management in an uncertain business environment. Originality/value: The study will help in better understanding of the various demand risks prevalent in the Indian auto sector. The methodology used, provides a novel approach for assessing the macroeconomic demand risks and can be used by the firms working in the automotive sector. The proposed methodology could be used for assessing supply chain risk or any other business initiative risk.

Accelerating globalization further exacerbate regional inequities hidden behind the global supply chains. Therefore, the energy use of construction industry embodied in interregional trade needs to be revealed considering the regional disparities. China, as the largest developing country, suffers from massive spending on infrastructure construction. Therefore, investigating the interactions between China's construction industry and the rest of the world is imperative. Previous researches fail to provide a holistic view of energy interactions induced by the global construction industry. This study details the global supply chain of the construction industry by merging 31 Chinese regions into the complex global trading network, which is beneficial for making fair energy reduction strategies. Results show that both embodied energy use and direct energy use exhibit a strong positive linear correlation with GDP. Interregional trade increases the inequality of energy use in the global construction industry, in which 81.67% of the regions possess an energy inequality indicator of the construction industry over 0.80, thus proving that the construction industry consumes a large amount of non-local energy. There is no significant relationship between the embodied intensity and GDP, whereas a weak linear correlation exists between intensity and embodied energy use. In China, Shanxi, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia represent a high intensity. There is a weak positive correlation between urbanization rate and embodied energy values. The findings of this research are critical in understanding the connections between province-level construction activities and the global trading network, which is beneficial for customizing and prioritizing policy recommendations for sustainable development of the global construction industry.",10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113838,Applied Energy,Construction industry | Global supply chain | Interregional trade | Multi-regional input-output analysis,85072553129,Embodied energy use in the global construction industry,2019.0

We deal with the logistic network, an important component of the Supply Chain, in industries either generating or using hazardous material (HM) in some stage of their productive processes. A major concern when transporting HM or locating hazardous facilities is to minimize risks and hazards to the population and environment. Most studies on this issue only consider one type of HM and fail to differentiate populations with different degrees of vulnerability. This work addresses both the problem of locating hazardous facilities and routing HMs across a large, densely populated urban area, minimizing the associated costs and hazards imposed on the population. Populations, aggregated in centers, were differentiated into vulnerable populations, which are the hardest to evacuate in a short period of time, and non-vulnerable populations. Several types of HMs with different degrees of hazard were considered. We propose a multi-objective programming model with multiple origin-destination (OD) pairs that considers maximizing the minimum weighted distance between hazardous facilities and the exposed vulnerable population, maximizing the minimum weighted distance from HM transportation arcs to the exposed vulnerable population, minimizing the total hazard imposed on the non-vulnerable population, and routing and location costs.

237,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd The current approaches to supply chain management generate large amounts of food waste due to the growing urbanization levels, increasing consumer demand for organic products and the growth of e-commerce distribution channel. These trends require the organizations to rethink their approaches to supply chain management, so that they could cope with the upcoming challenges. This research paper focuses on the ways a logistics cluster can provide the abilities to share information and thus improve the forecasting accuracy. The main novelty of the paper has been to work out a collaborative technological strategy which promotes information sharing in order to improve forecasting accuracy and inventory control for better alignment of demand and supply. The secondary contribution of the article is the determination of the influence of information sharing on forecasting accuracy in different market sizes, types and the consideration of consumer integration. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis has been completed to identify the optimal size of the logistics cluster the determination of which provides support when implementing the proposed strategy in practice. For the results validation we have implemented an agent-based model of the food supply chain. Our results have confirmed that information sharing increases the forecasting accuracy in multiple scenarios. Moreover, consumer integration is beneficial in a perfect competition market; however, its positive effect is less significant in an oligopoly market. These findings should be taken into consideration when developing e-commerce business strategy and forming logistics clusters. The usage of machine learning algorithms in the forecasting process provides adaptation capabilities for the supply chain members. The adaptation emerges as system resilience and it improves the alignment of demand and supply, reduces food waste levels and maintains higher nutrition value.

Healthcare supply chains (HSCs) have often been considered different from the usual supply chains (SCs) due to their high level of complexity, the presence of high-valuable medical materials and, finally, the fact that they deal with human lives. Furthermore, HSCs are not excluded from the increasing competitivity that is typical of the modern environment: International Healthcare systems are under increasing pressure to reduce waste and eliminate unnecessary costs while improving the quality and consistency of the care they provide to patient. The aim of this work is to analyse the impact of severe disruptions on SC performance in a Healthcare Supply Chain. More specifically, the objective of this study is to develop an approach to firstly analyse the effects of disruptions in terms of financial and operational performances, and successively to test different proactive and reactive mitigation strategies with the aim to maintain the highest service level, closed to 100%, in order to avoid shortages in hospitals’ wards. Disruptions can have a crucial impact on HSCs, because human lives can possibly be at the stake. Considering that the occurrence of disastrous events has been increasing in the last years, it is becoming inevitable to consider this risk in designing and planning HSCs that are more flexible and resilient. This work demonstrates that for long-lasting disruption, activating a backup supplier represents the most efficient mitigation strategy; on the other hand, for small-scale and short-duration disruptions, lateral transshipment represents a good way to mitigate the negative impacts of disruptions against a little increase in costs.",10.1007/s40171-019-00223-8,Global Journal of Flexible Systems Management,Case study | Centralized distribution network | Disruption | Healthcare supply chain | Mitigation strategy | Simulation,85075855053,Healthcare Supply Chain Simulation with Disruption Considerations: A Case Study from Northern Italy,2019.0

At Agbogbloshie, despite the intentions of national Ghanaian regulations and hazardous waste laws, most e-waste is untreated or crudely processed via burning or acid baths. These practices release dioxins, furans, and heavy metals into the environment, invariably harming scrapyard workers, their families, and the greater urban community of Accra. However, the scrapyard also provides a critical source of livelihood for some of Ghana's most poor, vulnerable, and unskilled migrants. The aim and objective of this study is to humanize the conundrums and challenges that e-waste invokes in places such as Ghana. Based on extensive and original field research—including expert interviews, community interviews with scrapyard workers and families, and naturalistic observation at waste sites and other parts of the e-waste supply chain—this study asks: What benefits has e-waste brought communities in Ghana? What risks has it created? And, critically, what policies need implemented to make e-waste more sustainable? It documents ten ostensible benefits of e-waste alongside ten very real and growing risks.

The implementation of bio-based technologies mostly takes place on a regional scale. Therefore, from a regional perspective, a key question revolves around what main challenges are associated with technological developments that could catalyze the implementation of sustainable bioeconomy regions. In this study, a cross-cutting analysis was carried out to determine these challenges. First, interviews were conducted with industry practitioners and scientists working in the bioeconomy field. These interviews were supplemented with a literature review to determine the status quo of bioeconomy strategies and their implementation, particularly on a regional level. A multidisciplinary workshop was then organized to identify the most relevant challenges in the short-and mid-term associated with establishing bioeconomy regions. The results show that there is a three-pronged challenge in innovative technological development from a regional perspective: (1) Resources: The establishment of sustainable regional feedstock strategies and supplies for supporting the bio-industrial sector; (2) collaborators: The establishment of a regional ""critical mass"" by fostering supply chain clusters and networks; and (3) neighbors: Understanding the local dynamics of societal trends and preferences and social acceptance of bio-technologies and their representative bio-based products.",10.3390/su11247235,Sustainability (Switzerland),Bioeconomy | Innovation | Life cycle thinking | Regional bioeconomy | Regional management | Systems assessment | Technological assessment | Technological development,85078976453,"Resources, collaborators, and neighbors: The three-pronged challenge in the implementation of bioeconomy regions",2019.0

The majority of commercially oriented microfluidic technologies provide novel point-of-use solutions for laboratory automation with important areas in the context of the life sciences such as health care, biopharma, veterinary medicine and agrifood as well as for monitoring of the environment, infrastructures and industrial processes. Such systems are often composed of a modular setup exhibiting an instrument accommodating rather conventional actuation, detection and control units which interfaces with a fluidically integrated ""Lab-on-a-Chip"" device handling (bio-)sample(s) and reagents. As the complex network of tiny channels, chambers and surface-functionalised zones can typically not be properly cleaned and regenerated, these microfluidic chips are mostly devised as single-use disposables. The availability of cost-efficient materials and associated structuring, functionalisation and assembly schemes thus represents a key ingredient along the commercialisation pipeline and will be a first focus of this work. Furthermore, and owing to their innate variability, investigations on biosamples mostly require the acquisition of statistically relevant datasets. Consequently, intermediate numbers of consistently performing chips are already needed during application development; to mitigate the potential pitfalls of technology migration and to facilitate regulatory compliance of the end products, manufacture of such pilot series should widely follow larger-scale production schemes. To expedite and de-risk the development of commercially relevant microfluidic systems towards high Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), we illustrate a streamlined, manufacturing-centric platform approach employing the paradigms of tolerance-forgiving Design-for-Manufacture (DfM) and Readiness for Scale-up (RfS) from prototyping to intermediate pilot series and eventual mass fabrication. Learning from mature industries, we further propose pursuing a platform approach incorporating aspects of standardisation in terms of specification, design rules and testing methods for materials, components, interfaces, and operational procedures; this coherent strategy will foster the emergence of dedicated commercial supply chains and also improve the economic viability of Lab-on-a-Chip systems often targeting smaller niche markets by synergistically bundling technology development.",10.3390/mi10120886,Micromachines,Design-for-Manufacture | Functional integration | Lab-on-a-Chip | Microfluidic platform | Scale-up of manufacture | Standardisation | Technology readiness level | Tolerance-forgiving design,85079063157,Efficient development of integrated lab-on-a-chip systems featuring operational robustness and manufacturability,2019.0

Container terminals are the typical representatives of complex supply chain logistics hubs with multiple compound attributes and multiple coupling constraints, and their operations are provided with the strong characteristics of dynamicity, nonlinearity, coupling, and complexity (DNCC). From the perspective of computational logistics, we propose the container terminal logistics generalized computing architecture (CTL-GCA) by the migration, integration, and fusion of the abstract hierarchy, design philosophy, execution mechanism, and automatic principles of computer organization, computing architecture, and operating system. The CTL-GCA is supposed to provide the problem-oriented exploration and exploitation elementary frameworks for the abstraction, automation, and analysis of green production at container terminals. The CTL-GCA is intended to construct, evaluate, and improve the solution to planning, scheduling, and decision at container terminals, which all are nondeterministic polynomial hard problems. Subsequently, the logistics generalized computational pattern recognition and performance evaluation of a practical container terminal service case study is launched by the qualitative and quantitative approach from the sustainable perspective of green production. The case study demonstrates the application, utilization, exploitation, and exploration of CTL-GCA preliminarily, and finds the unsustainable patterns of production at the container terminal. From the above, we can draw the following conclusions. For one thing, the CTL-GCA makes a definition of the abstract and automatic running architecture of logistics generalized computation for container terminals (LGC-CT), which provides an original framework for the design and implementation of control and decision mechanism and algorithm. For another, the CTL-GCA can help us to investigate the roots of DNCC thoroughly, and then the CTL-GCA makes for conducting the efficient and sustainable running pattern recognition of LGC-CT.

The MFT sustainability assessment involves several subjective criteria, incomplete criteria information, and vagueness in the group decision-making process. To keep above nature of the decision-making problem, this paper use intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) based MCDM framework for sustainability assessment. The IF method is suitable for incorporating experts importance degree in decision-making problem. The proposed sustainability framework includes social, technical, economic, environmental, and political (STEEP) sustainability dimension for assessment of MFT location. The framework considers twenty-five sub-criteria, including four new criteria for location assessment. The importance of STEEP criterion is computed by employing IF-analytic hierarchy process (IF-AHP).

Purpose: Stakeholders such as customers, governments and environmental organisations are more concerned than ever about the impact of supply chain practices on the environment, leading firms to introduce environmental requirements into their supply contracts. While the extant literature on supply chains acknowledges this trend, it fails to inform comprehensively on the concept of “stringent environmental requirement” and its consequences. The purpose of this paper is to investigate this concept and explore how such requirements may translate into supplier environmental performance. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative methodology was adopted by the study and data were collected through conducting eight case studies in the Bangladesh ready-made garment (RMG) industry. Findings: A number of factors were found to be influencing suppliers’ perception of stringency, such as uncertainty relating to the newness and deadline of buyers’ environmental requirements, the complexity of implementing the requirements, and the use of buyer-specific frameworks. The research also shows that suppliers’ efforts in building environmental capability play a vital role in dealing with stringent environmental requirements. Research limitations/implications: The case studies are limited to the Bangladesh RMG industry. Given that environmental regulations vary across different countries and industries, the data may not reflect all the possible variations in stringent environmental requirements. Practical implications: The new insight proposed by this research can guide firms to further understand how supplier environmental performance and the sustainability of their supply chain can be achieved. The research provides broad insight into how suppliers can address stringent environmental requirements and improve their environmental performance. Originality/value: This research establishes evidence for the relatively new phenomenon of “stringent environmental requirements”, and develops a theoretical framework to demonstrate the relationships among the critical determinants relevant to this phenomenon.",10.1108/IJPDLM-08-2018-0305,International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management,Buyer–supplier relationship | Dynamic capability theory | Green supply chain | Stringent buyer environmental requirements | Supplier environmental capability | Transaction cost economics,85074896069,How do suppliers address stringent environmental requirements from buyers?

For tacking the new complexities of the business, a concept of knowledge supply chain (KSC) is being proposed, which takes into account of knowledge component. Higher education institutes (HEIs) which are primary creator of knowledge are important foundations of such supply chain and act as the “knowledge supplier.” The purpose of this paper is to focus on why the HEIs are failed to become knowledge supplier in developing country like India. Design/methodology/approach: This research paper adopts a resource-based theory to explore the concept and identify barriers which obstructs the progress of HEIs to become prominent knowledge supplier to industry. To tackle the research problem, an integrated hybrid approach of interpretive structural modeling–analytic hierarchy process is used. Expert elicitation was engaged to find out the prominence of each barrier and the interrelations among them. Findings: Based on literature review, eight critical barriers were recognized. The findings put forward a four layer structural model. Based on this model, various remedial actions are also suggested to eliminate the barriers or lessen their negative effects on KSC. Practical implications: This study finds its practical implication in higher education reforms as the identified barriers could enhance the decision-making quality regarding academia–industry interaction. Social implications: Using the results of the study, HEIs could improve their social sustainability as they have different stakeholders covering wider sections of society and one being industry.

249,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd Biogas production is one of the most promising pathways toward fully utilizing green energy within a circular economy. The anaerobic digestion process is the industry standard technology for biogas production due to its lowered energy consumption and its reliance on microbiology. Even in such an environmental-friendly process, liquid digestate is still produced from the remains of digested bio-feedstock and will require treatment. With unsuitable treatment procedure for liquid digestate, the mass of bio-feedstock can potentially escape the circular supply chain within the economy. This paper recommends the implementation of evaporator systems to provide a sustainable liquid digestate treating mechanism within the economy. Studied evaporator systems are represented by vacuum evaporation in combination with ammonia scrubber, stripping and reverse osmosis. Nevertheless, complex multi-dimensional decisions should be made by stakeholders before implementing such systems. Our work utilizes a novel techno-economics model to study the techno-economics robustness in implementing recent state-of-art vacuum evaporation systems with exploitation of waste heat from combined heat and power (CHP) units in biogas plants (BGP). To take into the account the stochasticity of the real world and robustness of the analysis, we used the Monte-Carlo simulation technique to generate more than 20,000 of different possibilities for the implementation of the evaporation system. Favourable decision pathways are then selected using a novel methodology which utilizes the artificial neural network and a hyper-optimized decision tree classifier. Two pathways that give the highest probability of providing a fast payback period are identified. Descriptive statistics are also used to analyse the distributions of decision parameters that lead to success in implementing the evaporator system. The results highlighted that integration of evaporation system are favourable when transport costs and incentives for CHP units are large and while feed-in tariffs for electricity production and specific investment costs are low. The result of this work is expected to pave the way for BGP stakeholders and decision makers in implementing liquid digestate treating technologies within the currently existing infrastructure.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.117870,Journal of Cleaner Production,Ammonium sulphate solution | Anaerobic digestion | Biogas plant | Circular economy | Energy consumption | Liquid digestate | Machine learning | Nutrient recovery | Vacuum evaporation,85070258305,"Digestate evaporation treatment in biogas plants: A techno-economic assessment by Monte Carlo, neural networks and decision trees",2019.0

Purpose: Although managers have struggled with SKU proliferation for decades, research has provided inconsistent guidance, and the cross-functional and cross-firm aspects of the problem were not considered. The purpose of this paper is to explore the factors that favor successful and sustainable SKU rationalization. Design/methodology/approach: A single case study was used to investigate the implementation of an SKU rationalization project by a national restaurant chain in collaboration with its food distributor. Qualitative data analysis techniques were used to understand managers’ perceptions about the SKU rationalization problem and the financial results that were achieved. Findings: The findings include seven propositions that begin to formalize theory for SKU rationalization. Cross-functional involvement was both a challenge and a critical success factor, and the supplier was an important resource for managing product variety and complexity. Research limitations/implications: Seven propositions are provided that increase the likelihood of successfully dealing with SKU proliferation. Practical implications: SKU proliferation increases supply chain complexity and leads to higher costs.

Hydrogen and fuel cell technologies are one solution for addressing the challenges that major airports are facing today, such as upward price trends of liquid hydrocarbon fuels, greenhouse gas emission regulations, and stricter noise and air pollutant emission regulations, especially for on-ground pollution. An airport can also be viewed as the center of a hydrogen ecosystem, around which multiple hydrogen users could be clustered, with cost sharing of hydrogen production and storage occurring among users. The main novelty of the present work is the design of a hydrogen infrastructure irrigated by the airport ecosystem that satisfies the airport ecosystem energy needs. For this purpose, the model development is based on a multiobjective optimization framework designed to consider four echelons: energy sources, hydrogen production, transportation, and storage. The multiperiod problem is then solved using the ϵ-constraint method. Two objective functions are involved, that is, the total daily cost (TDC) of the network and an environmental indicator based on the global warming potential. The second innovative contribution is to model the demand uncertainty using fuzzy concepts for a hydrogen supply chain design. Because hydrogen demand is one the most significant parameters, the uncertainty of the demand has been considered using a proposed fuzzy linear programming strategy. The solutions are compared with the original crisp model, giving more robustness to the proposed approach. This work has been performed in the framework of the Hyport meta-project and, in particular, within the ""H2 modeling"" project. This paper focuses on a hydrogen airport ecosystem located in the department of Hautes-Pyrénées (France). However, the developed methodology could be extended to other hydrogen ecosystems for which deployment involves a multiperiod multi-objective formulation under an uncertain demand.",10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b02620,ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,airport ecosystem | demand under uncertainty | hydrogen supply chain | MILP | optimization,85074430452,Optimal Design of a Sustainable Hydrogen Supply Chain Network: Application in an Airport Ecosystem,2019.0

To this end, it is critical to achieve effective communication among the partners in water supply chain networks. In this paper, we focus on one of the UK’s largest water utility companies and its eight main contractors and analyze the factors influencing partner and network communication in a managed programme of their asset supply chain. We employ social network analysis to conduct the cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of partner communication. Factors found to influence the communication network are grouping of projects within the programme, individual’s organisational affiliation, status, tenure, elapsed time through the programme lifecycle, and co-location. Our contributions to practice include demonstrating water programme management factors that influence communication and trust and how social network analysis can better inform them about intra-and interorganisational relationships.

253,"© 2019 The Authors Agricultural systems in Europe face accumulating economic, ecological and societal challenges, raising concerns about their resilience to shocks and stresses. These resilience issues need to be addressed with a focus on the regional context in which farming systems operate because farms, farmers' organizations, service suppliers and supply chain actors are embedded in local environments and functions of agriculture. We define resilience of a farming system as its ability to ensure the provision of the system functions in the face of increasingly complex and accumulating economic, social, environmental and institutional shocks and stresses, through capacities of robustness, adaptability and transformability. We (i) develop a framework to assess the resilience of farming systems, and (ii) present a methodology to operationalize the framework with a view to Europe's diverse farming systems. The framework is designed to assess resilience to specific challenges (specified resilience) as well as a farming system's capacity to deal with the unknown, uncertainty and surprise (general resilience). The framework provides a heuristic to analyze system properties, challenges (shocks, long-term stresses), indicators to measure the performance of system functions, resilience capacities and resilience-enhancing attributes. Capacities and attributes refer to adaptive cycle processes of agricultural practices, farm demographics, governance and risk management. The novelty of the framework pertains to the focal scale of analysis, i.e. the farming system level, the consideration of accumulating challenges and various agricultural processes, and the consideration that farming systems provide multiple functions that can change over time. Furthermore, the distinction between three resilience capacities (robustness, adaptability, transformability) ensures that the framework goes beyond narrow definitions that limit resilience to robustness. The methodology deploys a mixed-methods approach: quantitative methods, such as statistics, econometrics and modelling, are used to identify underlying patterns, causal explanations and likely contributing factors; while qualitative methods, such as interviews, participatory approaches and stakeholder workshops, access experiential and contextual knowledge and provide more nuanced insights. More specifically, analysis along the framework explores multiple nested levels of farming systems (e.g. farm, farm household, supply chain, farming system) over a time horizon of 1–2 generations, thereby enabling reflection on potential temporal and scalar trade-offs across resilience attributes. The richness of the framework is illustrated for the arable farming system in Veenkoloniën, the Netherlands. The analysis reveals a relatively low capacity of this farming system to transform and farmers feeling distressed about transformation, while other members of their households have experienced many examples of transformation.",10.1016/j.agsy.2019.102656,Agricultural Systems,Enabling environment | Farming systems | Long-term stresses | Private and public goods | Resilience capacities | Shocks,85070191585,A framework to assess the resilience of farming systems,2019.0

Eliminating unnecessary healthcare waste in hospitals and providing better healthcare quality are the core issues of green supply chain management (GSCM). Hence, this study used a hospital’s emergency department crowding (EDC) problem to illustrate how to establish an emergency medicine service (EMS) simulation system to obtain a robust parameters setting for solving hospitals’ EDC and waste problems, thereby increasing healthcare quality. Inappropriate resource allocation results in more serious EDC; more serious EDC results in increasing operating costs. Therefore, in the healthcare system, waste includes inappropriate costs and inappropriate resource allocation. The EMS of a medical center in central Taiwan was the object of the study. In this study, the dynamic Taguchi method was used to set the signal factor, noise factor, and control factors to simulate the EMS system to obtain the optimal parameters setting. The performance was set to Emergency Department Work Index (EDWINC) and system time (waiting time and service time) per patient. The signal factor was set to the number of physicians; the noise factor was set to patient arrival rate; the control factors included persuading Triage 4 and Triage 5 outpatients, checkup process, bed occupation rate in the emergency department (ED), and medical checkup sequence for Triage 4 and Triage 5 patients. This study makes two significant contributions. First, the study introduces the GSCM concept to the healthcare setting to bring green innovation to hospitals. Hospital administrators may hence design better GSCM activities to facilitate healthcare processes to provide better healthcare outcomes. Second, the study applied the dynamic Taguchi method to the EMS and neural network (NN) to construct a computational model revealing the cause (factors) and effect (performances) relationship. In addition, the genetic algorithm (GA), a solution method, was used to obtain the optimal parameters setting of the EDC in Taiwan. Hence, after obtaining the solutions, the unnecessary waste in EDC—inappropriate costs and inappropriate resource allocation—is reduced.",10.3390/ijerph16214087,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,Dynamic Taguchi method | Emergency department crowding (EDC) | Emergency medicine service (EMS) | Genetic algorithm (GA) | Green supply chain management (GSCM) | Neural network (NN),85074167932,The application of GSCM in eliminating healthcare waste: Hospital EDC as an example,2019.0

The long-term success of the sector will depend on the control of social and environmental resources in the entire product life cycle. The “circular economy” (CE) concept is fast becoming a new model for resilient growth. However, CE continues to be understood largely as a waste management and recycling strategy, but the economic opportunities are far broader and more diverse. The success of the CE in developing countries will be critical to global efforts to ensure sustainable growth. Brazil’s textile and garment industry is the largest complete textile chain in the West and ranks among the world’s top producers of textiles and apparel. This sector is also the second largest generator of manufacturing jobs in Brazil. On the other hand, of the 8 million workers that are estimated, 6.5 are irregular ones. The objective of this paper was to provide a comprehensive review of research efforts encompassing aspects of CE as value network, local production, economic benefits and Brazilian fashion market. By this, it is expected to bring new contributions to neglected issues, the manufacturing base as CE strategy and the social performance. The two main contributions of this research are to highlight Brazilian focus and to find how circular approaches align with and support the already existing domestic industrial and social development strategies.",10.1007/s42452-019-1487-z,SN Applied Sciences,Brazil | Circular economy | Fashion | Local manufacture | Supply chain | Sustainability | Textile,85100789516,Brazilian potential for circular fashion through strengthening local production,2019.0

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate overlaps, complementarities and divergences between the literature on circular economy (CE) models and related literature in non-linear production models and frameworks, including CE, reverse logistics, closed-loop, industrial symbiosis and industrial ecology. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review was conducted focussing on the benefits of non-linear modes adoption. Findings: The results show a high degree of convergence in findings, gaps and weaknesses of these literatures. Negative environmental, economic and operational impacts are understudied. There is a scarcity of studies identifying practices resulting in empirically tested benefits. The business and society case for non-linear production is still largely built upon conceptual studies, modelling and a few case studies. Despite a normative focus, there is very little use of theory, in particular, management theories. Research limitations/implications: First, the authors use only one, albeit highly recognized database, Scopus. This database may have omitted some relevant research, journals such as the Journal of Cleaner Production and Resources Conservation & Recycling that are more likely to publish such research and also have a more interdisciplinary approach. This is an important gap and interesting result to claim for more interdisciplinary research. Second, the filtering process used and the focus on Association of Business Schools top journals may have also omitted some relevant research, such as a large stream of literature in specialist journals such as Resources Conservation and Recycling and the Journal of Cleaner Production. Practical implications: There are contradictions, tensions and epistemological ambiguity that needs to be critically addressed. Such tensions may be associated with the knowledge field that gave rise to these different non-linear production approaches. Many of them appeared at the same time, but from different sciences and disciplines with their own perspectives. Then in doing so, they create confusion in the definitions of CE, assumptions underlying modelling and business choices arising from this complexity. This can be minimized through the critical interpretation of knowledge to elucidate epistemological quandaries to improve the understanding of the economic, social and environmental impacts of practices. Social implications: In some way, this result makes sense, as the authors have limited the search to management, business and accounts journals, especially talking about Operations Management journals. This is an important gap and interesting result to claim for more interdisciplinary research. Originality/value: In addition to gaps previously described, the authors identified areas of tensions where the literature offers inconclusive – often contradictory – findings requiring further exploration. A better understanding of these tensions is required to understand the impacts of non-linear production and develop policy guidelines for industry and policymakers to scale-up CE.",10.1108/SCM-06-2018-0213,Supply Chain Management,Agile systems | Circular economy | Circularity | Closed loop supply chains | Overlaps | Systematic literature review | Theories,85073614937,"Circular economy: benefits, impacts and overlapping",2019.0

An optimized supply chain network (SCN) has been designed with four layers of structure starting from raw material suppliers to the retailers through the layers of the manufacturers and the distributors aiming at the net present value (NPV) maximization. The cost calculation includes operating expenditure (OPEX) and capital expenditure (CAPEX) components involving transport, storage, production and import decisions as linear variables and decisions on connections between two nodes between two consecutive layers as binary variables. The distribution layer of the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model has been uniquely designed for the imported ethanol to serve the twin purposes of meeting the unmet demand as well as enhancing the bio-ethanol product quality in terms of research octane number. The revenue generation is calculated not only from selling the final product but also from the carbon credits calculated using greenhouse gas emission (GHGe) during project life cycle assessment. Further, sensitivity analysis has been performed to show the effect of various parameters such as modes of transport, transport distance limitation on feedstock and product, number of zones, international fuel price fluctuations, feedstock availability on NPV.

In the current study, we developed a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for a reverse logistics network design (RLND) in a multi-period setting. The RL network consists of collection centres, capacitated inspection and remanufacturing centres and customer zones to serve. Moreover, the model incorporates significant characteristics such as vehicle type selection and carbon emissions (through transportation and operations). Since the network design problems are NP-hard, we first propose a solution approach based on Benders decomposition (BD). Then, based on the structure of the problem we propose a three-phase heuristic approach. Finally, to establish the performance and robustness of the proposed solution approach, the results are compared with benchmark results obtained using CPLEX in terms of both solution quality and computational time.

Supply chain network design (SCND) is an important strategic decision determining the structure of each entity in the supply chain, which has an important impact on the long-term development of a company. An efficient and effective supply chain network is of vital importance for improving customer satisfaction, optimizing the allocation of resources, and increasing profitability. The environmental concerns and social responsibility awareness of the whole society have spurred researchers and managers to design sustainable supply chains (SSCs) integrating the economic, environmental, and social factors. In addition, the innate uncertainty of the SCND problem requires an integrated method to cope. In this regard, this study develops a multi-echelon multi-objective robust fuzzy closed-loop supply chain network (CLSCN) design model under uncertainty including all three dimensions of sustainability. This model considers the total cost minimization, carbon caps, and social impact maximization concurrently to realize supply chain sustainability, and is able to make a balance between the conflicting multiple objectives. Meanwhile, the uncertainty of the parameters is divided into two categories and addressed with two approaches: the first category is missed working days related to social impact, which is solved by the fuzzy membership theory; the second category is the demand and remanufacturing rate, which is settled by a robust optimization method. To validate the ability and applicability of the model and solution approach, a numerical example is conducted and solved using ILOG CPLEX. The result shows that the supply chain network structure and the value of the optimization objectives will change when considering sustainability and different degrees of uncertainty. This will enable supply chain managers to reduce the environmental impact and enhance the social benefits of their supply chain activities, and design a more stable supply chain to better cope with the influence of uncertainty.",10.3390/su11205726,Sustainability (Switzerland),Closed-loop supply chain | Fuzzy membership degree | Network design | Robust optimization | Sustainability,85074000749,A robust fuzzy optimization model for closed-loop supply chain networks considering sustainability,2019.0

The earlier planning methods of supply chains (SC) in the skeleton of the extended material requirements planning (EMRP), where the time horizon of the reverse Laplace is infinite, were not convenient to estimate the impact of the technical obsolescence of the product or technology involved, which has economic, environmental, and social consequences. Therefore, the perturbations of timing are presented until the possible obsolescence, with parallel execution of the network simulation model (NSM) to evaluate the impact of the finite lifespan on the value of the chain. The EMRP, as well as the NSM, are based on the skeleton of the material requirements planning model, where delays and their perturbations are presented transparently. Contrary to the previous studies of the net present value (NPV) in the EMRP skeleton, where the infinite horizon is assumed, the impact of shortening the horizon of activities is shown here, in order to also evaluate the risk of financing investments in the SC with a shorter lifespan of products or technology. Owing to the simultaneous appearances of the stochastic variables, the parallel execution and exchanging of data, using NSM is advised.

263,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd In the new global economy, intensive production models based on high-yield varieties of wheat have become a central issue for the fight against hunger, undernourishment, and poverty. Nonetheless, this intensive model - and the related globalized processing and marketing system – poses a challenge to the conservation of biodiversity and to environmental sustainability. In addition, volatility on world cereal markets is threatening farmers' income, triggering diversification patterns. One of this pattern is the creation of alternative food chains intended as supply chains that are territorially embedded and able to reconnect producers with consumers. In this context, this paper aims to explore the diversity of alternative bread chains and valorisation practices, in order to identify organizational models, assess their economic performance in terms of creating added value distributing it along the stages of the chain and to understand the role played by ancient wheat varieties in differentiating the product. In order to do this, the paper develops a comparative case study analysis of several locally-based alternative bread supply chains in Tuscany (Italy). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key actors, selected considering all the steps in the supply chain: from growing the wheat and milling the grain through to the end product. From these interviews differences emerged between locally-based bread supply chains in terms of the valorisation system followed and the institutional arrangements. While the locally-based chains featuring modern wheat varieties have more conventional characteristics and pursue differentiation strategies based on certification, chains based on ancient wheat follow a more informal route, and product quality is mainly guaranteed by the reputation of the network. Furthermore, in the bread supply chains featuring ancient varieties, the methods for reducing transaction costs are linked to a bottom-up collective action, embeddedness strategies among stakeholders (that include also consumers), and are built on a relational approach based on trust, knowledge exchange and social networks. Results provide an assessment of the performances of different locally-based bread supply chains, identify critical aspects and suggest some policy implications for all types of chains.",10.1016/j.jrurstud.2019.09.006,Journal of Rural Studies,Alternative bread supply chains | Ancient wheat varieties | Biodiversity conservation | Governance models | Low-input farming,85072274069,The valorisation of wheat production through locally-based bread chains: Experiences from Tuscany,2019.0

265,"Copyright: © 2019 INFORMS We introduce a new class of adaptive policies called periodic-affine policies, which allows a decision maker to optimally manage and control large-scale newsvendor networks in the presence of uncertain demand without distributional assumptions. These policies are data-driven and model many features of the demand such as correlation and remain robust to parameter misspecification. We present a model that can be generalized to multiproduct settings and extended to multiperiod problems. This is accomplished by modeling the uncertain demand via sets. In this way, it offers a natural framework to study competing policies such as base-stock, affine, and approximative approaches with respect to their profit, sensitivity to parameters and assumptions, and computational scalability. We show that the periodic-affine policies are sustainable—that is, time consistent—because they warrant optimality both within subperiods and over the entire planning horizon. This approach is tractable and free of distributional assumptions, and, hence, suited for real-world applications. We provide efficient algorithms to obtain the optimal periodic-affine policies and demonstrate their advantages on the sales data from one of India’s largest pharmacy retailers.",10.1287/mnsc.2018.3152,Management Science,Affine policies | Correlation | Demand uncertainty | Healthcare: pharmacy retailer | Newsvendor network | Robust optimization,85075388178,Sustainable inventory with robust periodic-affine policies and application to medical supply chains,2019.0

The volume and breadth of publications in this area makes it difficult to understand the knowledge structure of the field and the academic work that has influenced the evolution of the domain. This mixed-method study systematically reviews 246 papers that investigated supplier selection issues and were published between 1991 and 2017. We initially examined the statistics of papers by unveiling influential journals, affiliations and articles. Second, we utilized co-citation network analysis, an objective procedure to extract clusters of what has been researched in supplier selection literature.

Adoption and sustained use of solar PV merit participation of local communities in planning and implementation. The literature on off-grid solar PV interventions that do not take the approach of involving communities point towards the difficulties experienced in reaching the bottom of the pyramid (BoP) communities as wells as in supply chain and after-sales service. Similarly, there is a gap in scientific literature that explores community inclusive initiatives to foster sustained uptake of solar PV technologies. Our study fills this gap, and discusses: 1) pathways to engage with rural poor communities to promote solar off-grid access, and 2) the impact of engaging with these communities particularly women, on their energy security and livelihood opportunities. We study a two-phased intervention in rural poor setting in Dungarpur district of Rajasthan state in India. The intervention can be broadly classified into two phases: (i) the distribution of solar study lamps to rural school students and mothers, wherein the lamps were assembled and maintained by the local community (self-help group networks), (ii) the entrepreneurship development of local community members towards continued livelihood through solar. We adopted mixed methods approach to collect and analyze the quantitative data from beneficiary households, while qualitative data were collected from SHG members. Our findings demonstrate the utility of localized intervention and the significance and challenges of engaging local communities. The consumers used these solar lamps for multiple activities and prefer solar over grid electricity for basic lighting. The voltage fluctuations or poor quality of electricity supply influences the preference to solar over the conventional grid. Local services enabled continued functioning of lamps, thereby increasing consumer confidence. The intervention built capacity of and created continued livelihood opportunities for local women in these communities, resulting in their economic and social growth. Appropriate capacity building and support to the SHG federations can channelize clean energy interventions at required speed, quality, and coverage. In the context of energy poor BoP communities of the Global South, our research provides key determinants impacting development of community-centered renewable energy interventions, crucial for the realization of Sustainable Development Goal 7.",10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.05.028,World Development,India | Off-grid solar | Solar energy eco-system | Solar lamps | Sustained use,85067002822,Does involvement of local community ensure sustained energy access?

The last few years have seen a great number of announcements and projections on cities of the future, where technological interconnected metering infrastructure is the main smart-grid unit, promoting higher sustainability due to its more efficient management capability. The water supply network is one of the grids that has been given additional attention due to the problem of waste caused by water leakage, usually requiring rapid detection for fast intervention to prevent high costs. With centralised information coming from the grid, like the measurement of pressure and flow, it is revealed that anomaly detection could be an important tool for quick automatic detection without needing permanent analysis by a human operator. However, there is a need for a more robust approach, especially when noisy data are present. In this paper, we propose the implementation of a new approach based on a hybrid expectation maximization (EM) Gaussian model combined with a t-distribution mixture. This approach is compared to both a pure EM Gaussian mixture model and a t-distribution mixture model that can use labelled data or not. Each EM algorithm was applied to real data acquired from a water supply grid with the aim of automatically detecting water leaks. Using the newly developed approach, the results show that detection is both possible and more accurate for this type of database.",10.1088/1361-6501/ab3b48,Measurement Science and Technology,clustering | distribution functions | expectation maximization | remote sensing | semi-supervised | water leak detection,85075668046,Semi-supervised Gaussian and t-distribution hybrid mixture model for water leak detection,2019.0

Precast supply chain, as a vital connection between construction sites and off-site plants, is the focus of many recent studies. While these studies have greatly advanced precast supply chain management (PSCM), a critical analysis to summarize the recent research, to identify research gaps, and to inform future research needs is largely missing in the field of precast supply chain management. The overarching goal of this paper is to create a taxonomy to properly classify existing studies in precast supply chain management so as to reveal research gaps and suggest future research opportunities. The specific tasks in this review project include: (1) conducting bibliographic categorizations with regard to journals, years and geographic distributions of publications; (2) identifying the citation correlations and formulating the keyword connection networks; (3) classifying the literature based on research topics and highlighting the state of the art pertaining to each subtopic. The in-depth analysis shows that the studies on precast production are dominant in the PSCM domain. The major research approaches used in existing studies include the genetic algorithm, simulation, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), and BIM (Building Information Modeling).

The results show that some critical betweenness sectors, such as Metal products sector and Electrical equipment sector, have huge potential for carbon emission reduction, which fail to receive sufficient attention from the perspective of production or consumption. Some critical transactions, such as the transaction from Nonmetal products sector to Construction sector, have a large amount of CO2 emissions. The transaction from Metallurgy sector to Electrical equipment sector became increasingly important in China from 2005 to 2015. Additionally, the evolutionary trends of different transactions are significantly different. The findings reveal that special attention should be paid to these critical betweenness sectors and transactions and policy development should be dynamic to respond to changes in CO2 emissions that are generated by different betweenness sectors and transactions.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.05.346,Journal of Cleaner Production,Carbon emission | Critical sectors | Critical transactions | Network centrality | Structural path analysis,85066731953,Identification and evolution of critical betweenness sectors and transactions from the view of CO<inf>2</inf> reduction in supply chain network,2019.0

This paper aims to develop a recovery planning approach in a three-tier manufacturing supply chain, which has a single supplier, manufacturer, and retailer under an imperfect production environment, in which we consider three types of sudden disturbances: demand fluctuation, and disruptions to production and raw material supply, which are not known in advance. Firstly, a mathematical model is developed for generating an ideal plan under imperfect production for a finite planning horizon while maximizing total profit, and then we re-formulate the model to generate the recovery plan after happening of each sudden disturbance. Considering the high commercial cost and computational intensity and complexity of this problem, we propose an efficient heuristic, to obtain a recovery plan, for each disturbance type, for a finite future period, after the occurrence of a disturbance. The heuristic solutions are compared with a standard solution technique for a considerable number of random test instances, which demonstrates the trustworthy performance of the developed heuristics. We also develop another heuristic for managing the combined effects of multiple sudden disturbances in a period. Finally, a simulation approach is proposed to investigate the effects of different types of disturbance events generated randomly. We present several numerical examples and random experiments to explicate the benefits of our developed approaches. Results reveal that in the event of sudden disturbances, the proposed mathematical and heuristic approaches are capable of generating recovery plans accurately and consistently.",10.1007/s10479-019-03251-w,Annals of Operations Research,Demand fluctuation | Heuristic | Quantitative recovery plan | Sudden disturbance | Supply chain disruption,85065544928,A mathematical modelling approach for managing sudden disturbances in a three-tier manufacturing supply chain,2019.0
272,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd The complexity involved in demand forecast for supply chain management of electronics components is exponentially increasing owing to demand fluctuations in consumer electronics, shortening of product life cycles, continuous technology migration, lengthy production cycle time, and long lead time for capacity expansion. While global manufacturing networks often suffer the risks of oversupply and shortage of key components, the distributor that is the key intermediate participator in electronics product supply chain buys components from the suppliers, warehouses them, and resells different parts to a number of electronics manufacturers with vendor-managed inventories. Thus, the component distributors forecast the demands for large assortments of stock keeping units (SKUs) with distinct dynamics for inventory control and supply chain management. To address realistic needs to enhance demand forecast performance, this study aims to develop a UNISON data-driven analytics framework that integrates machine learning technologies and temporal aggregation mechanism to forecast the demands of intermittent electronics components.

Social and economic networks can be a channel of negative shocks and thus deteriorate resilience and sustainability in societies. This study focuses on supply chains, or supplier–customer networks of firms and examines how these supply chains enable production losses caused by natural disasters to propagate and persist in regions not directly affected by the disaster. We apply an agent-based model to the actual supply chains of nearly one million firms in Japan to estimate the direct and indirect effects of the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake. We then employ the same model to predict the effect of the Nankai Trough earthquake, a mega earthquake predicted to hit major industrial cities in Japan in the near future. We find that the indirect effects of the disasters on production due to propagation (10.6% of gross domestic product in the case of the Nankai earthquake) are substantially larger than their direct effects (0.5%). Our simulation analyses to compare the actual network with hypothetical networks suggest that these indirect effects are more prominent and persistent when supply chains are characterized by scale-free properties, difficulty in substitution among intermediate products, and complex cycles in networks.",10.1038/s41893-019-0351-x,Nature Sustainability,,85070817361,Firm-level propagation of shocks through supply-chain networks,2019.0

This paper addresses the design of a resilient green-closed loop supply chain network for perishable products under the risk of electric power network disruption. The research has presented an integrated model for the interdependent two-layer network structure as a strategy to mitigate the power disruption risk in order to minimize the expected total network cost and the expected total amount of carbon emissions. Integration of two networks on both objectives along with the effect of products’ lifetime has been analyzed in a real case study of the dairy industry. The results designate that the integration of the two networks leads to improvements in both objective functions. The average total network cost and total carbon emissions have been reduced by 21% and 25% compared to the non-integrated layers, respectively.

Purpose of Review: Differentiated service delivery (DSD) models were initially developed as a means to combat suboptimal long-term retention in HIV care, and to better titrate limited health systems resources to patient needs, primarily in low-income countries. The models themselves are designed to streamline care along the HIV care cascade and range from individual to group-based care and facility to community-based health delivery systems. However, much remains to be understood about how well and for whom DSD models work and whether these models can be scaled, are sustainable, and can reach vulnerable and high-risk populations. Implementation science is tasked with addressing some of these questions through systematic, scientific inquiry. We review the available published evidence on the implementation of DSD and suggest further health systems innovations needed to maximize the public health impact of DSD and future implementation science research directions in this expanding field. Recent Findings: While early observational data supported the effectiveness of various DSD models, more recently published trials as well as evaluations of national scale-up provide more rigorous evidence for effectiveness and performance at scale. Deeper understanding of the mechanism of effect of various DSD models and generalizability of studies to other countries or contexts remains somewhat limited. Relative implementability of DSD models may differ based on patient preference, logistical complexity of model adoption and maintenance, human resource and pharmacy supply chain needs, and comparative cost-effectiveness. However, few studies to date have evaluated comparative implementation or cost-effectiveness from a health systems perspective. Summary: While DSD represents an exciting and promising “next step” in HIV health care delivery, this innovation comes with its own set of implementation challenges. Evidence on the effectiveness of DSD generally supports the use of most DSD models, although it is still unclear which models are most relevant in diverse settings and populations and which are the most cost-effective. Challenges during scale-up highlight the need for accurate differentiation of patients, sustainable inclusion of a new cadre of health care worker (the community health care worker), and substantial strengthening of existing pharmacy supply chains. To maximize the public health impact of DSD, systems need to be patient-centered and adaptive, as well as employ robust quality improvement processes.",10.1007/s11904-019-00454-5,Current HIV/AIDS Reports,Differentiated service delivery | HIV | Implementation science | Patient-centered care | Sub-Saharan Africa,85068118778,"A Review of Differentiated Service Delivery for HIV Treatment: Effectiveness, Mechanisms, Targeting, and Scale",2019.0

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate effects on global supply chain reconfigured in the customs duty rate of parts and specific material types brought about by Brexit and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Design/methodology/approach: The supply chain network is modeled and formulated using mixed integer programming. Numerical experiments are conducted using bill of materials with information such as the procurement cost of each part, 3D-CAD and an industry census. Findings: The experiments indicates that if the customs duty rate increases by Brexit, manufacturers would be necessary to restructure supply chain configuration and locate the domestic factory and market. Additionally, when the UK leaves the EU and joins the TPP, there is a case where the total cost decreases in the global supply chain network compared to the baseline without Brexit. Therefore, it is reasonable for the UK to join the TPP. Practical implications: The study shows how new trading rules from non-partnership countries can critically disrupt existing global supply chain equilibrium. Asian manufacturers should evaluate a move to more local sourcing, opening new facilities and setting up warehouses to stock finished goods or raw materials in different trading areas to overcome any barriers to the goods movement.

The world's oceans face unprecedented anthropogenic threats in the globalized era that originate from all over the world, including climate change, global trade and transportation, and pollution. Marine protected areas (MPAs) serve important roles in conservation of marine biodiversity and ecosystem resilience, but their success is increasingly challenged in the face of such large-scale threats. Here, we illustrate the utility of adopting the interdisciplinary telecoupling framework to better understand effects that originate from distant places and cross MPA boundaries (e.g., polluted water circulation, anthropogenic noise transport, human and animal migration). We review evidence of distal processes affecting MPAs and the cutting-edge approaches currently used to investigate these processes. We then introduce the umbrella framework of telecoupling and explain how it can help address knowledge gaps that exist due to limitations of past approaches that are centered within individual disciplines. We then synthesize five examples from the recent telecoupling literature to explore how the telecoupling framework can be used for MPA research. These examples include the spatial subsidies approach, adapted social network analysis, telecoupled qualitative analysis, telecoupled supply chain analysis, and decision support tools for telecoupling. Our work highlights the potential for the telecoupling framework to better understand and address the mounting and interconnected socioeconomic and environmental sustainability challenges faced by the growing number of MPAs around the world.",10.3390/su11164450,Sustainability (Switzerland),Climate change | Marine protected area | Spillover | Telecoupling,85071011164,A synthesis of opportunities for applying the telecoupling framework to marine protected areas,2019.0

The considered chain, based on the study of a dairy company, is a multi-period and multi-product that comprises suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses, retailers and collection centers. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is projected to minimize the cost and environmental pollutant, simultaneously. Besides, an innovative MILP robust model is developed for the problem under uncertainty. Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, the research has developed an efficient heuristic, named YAG, to solve large-sized problems. Computational experiments conducted indicating that the YAG method has an average gap of less than 1.65 percent from the optimal solution within a reasonable time. Also, the YAG method finds the optimal solution in more than 34 percent of instances. The performance of the robust approach and the heuristic method is examined in a real case study and a diverse range of problems. The results revealed that the robust model compared to the deterministic model has better quality and seem quite more reliable.

Firstly, identification of AM’s capabilities in manufacturing final products in industry requires an accurate evaluation of their impacts across all supply chain stages. Secondly, making products additively entails potential consequences for different product lifecycle phases, e.g., design, preparation, production, usage, etc. that need to be managed accordingly. The current study tries to jointly address these two aspects by focusing on an extensive review of qualitative and quantitative cases taken from literature, as well as empirical observations made in industry. The study shows that impacts of AM technologies are not partial or isolated disruptions, but rather encompass a range of changes whose overall consequences spread across different phases of supply chain. Another result of the study is that a benchmarking of AM and conventional technologies on their overall performance is exhaustive only when all features of productions and logistics networks are evaluated simultaneously, rather than in their isolated states.",10.1007/s00170-019-03430-w,International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,Additive manufacturing | Qualitative analysis | Quantitative cases | Supply chain,85061665508,Supply chain implications of additive manufacturing: a holistic synopsis through a collection of case studies,2019.0

Recently, biomass has been received increasing attention due to its economic and environmental benefits. Olefin, as one of the key raw materials in petrochemical industries, is able to be produced from biomass feedstocks. This study presents a robust three-stage stochastic programming model to characterize and optimize an olefin supply chain/production network aiming to provide a reliable and economic logistics network to support olefin production. This model encompasses probabilistic scenarios and uncertainty sets to capture the seasonality of biomass feedstocks and the uncertainty of carbon tax rate, respectively. The Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is also involved in this model to complement the traditional biomass supplies to ensure the reliable feedstock for olefin production. To find the optimal solution of this model, a hybrid robust/stochastic approach is developed by integrating the affinely adjustable robust model with the sample average approximation (SAA) method. The state of Mississippi is used as a real case study to test and validate the proposed model and optimization approach. The results show that increasing feedstocks conversion rate by 20% and MSW recycling rate by 100% will increase olefin production by 17.26% and 14.3%, respectively, and increasing the carbon tax rate uncertainty from 0 to 30 will decrease the total network emissions by 2.8%.

Unfortunately, episodes of extreme weather have, in recent years, revealed vulnerabilities in global supply networks to high-impact events. With a possible increase in both frequency and intensity of these events due to climate change, supply chains are at risk of disruption now more than ever, with potential dire economic, societal, and environmental consequences. Acknowledging that the direct application of stochastic programming in this context can quickly lead to very large CPU times, we propose an algorithm that combines the sample average approximation method with a selection heuristic for extreme event scenarios.

Of the 498 publications identified in searches of the Scopus and Web of Science databases, 17 reported on combinations of methods: 10 on life-cycle assessment and geographic information systems, six on joint use of life-cycle assessment and discrete-time simulation, and one on use of geographic information systems jointly with discrete-time simulation. While no articles dealt directly with simultaneous use of all three methods, several acknowledged the potential of this. The authors discuss numerous challenges identified in the review that arise in combining methods, among them computational load, the increasing number of assumptions, guaranteeing coherence between the models used, and the large quantities of data required. Discussion of issues such as the complexity of reporting and the need for standard procedures and terms becomes more critical as repositories bring together research materials, including entire models, from various sources. Efforts to mitigate many of modeling's challenges have involved phase-specific modeling and use of such methods as expressions or uncertainty analysis in place of a complex secondary model.

In this paper, we use agent-based modeling (ABM) to study different obstacles to the expansion of contract rice farming in the context of Mekong Delta (MKD)‘s rice supply chain. ABM is a bottom-up approach for modeling the dynamics of interactionsamongindividuals and complex combinations of various factors (e.g., economic, social or environmental). Our agent-based contract farming model focuses on two critical components of contractual relationship, namely financial incentives and trust. We incorporate the actual recurrent fluctuations of spot market prices, which induce both contractor and farmer agents to renege on the agreement. The agent-based model is then used to predict emergent system-wide behaviors and compare counterfactual scenarios of different policies and initiatives on maintaining the contract rice farming scheme. Simulation results firstly show that a fully-equipped contractor who opportunistically exploits a relatively small proportion (less than 10%) of the contracted farmers in most instances can outperform spot market-based contractors in terms of average profit achieved for each crop. Secondly, a committed contractor who offers lower purchasing prices than the most typical rate can obtain better earnings per ton of rice as well as higher profit per crop. However, those contractors in both cases could not enlarge their contract farming scheme, since either farmers’ trust toward them decreases gradually or their offers are unable to compete with the benefits froma competitor or the spot market. Thirdly, the results are also in agreement with the existing literature that the contract farming scheme is not a cost-effective method for buyers with limited rice processing capacity, which is a common situation among the contractors in the MKD region. These results yield significant insights into the difficulty in expanding the agricultural contracting program in the MKD’s rice supply chain.",10.18564/jasss.4008,JASSS,Agent-based modeling | Agricultural supply chain | Computational simulation | Contract farming,85071277943,Contract farming in the Mekong Delta’s rice supply chain: Insights from an agent-based modeling study,2019.0

This paper places a critical spotlight on the ways in which governance and social responsibility concerning labour standards work in the context of public sector procurement. Supply chains provisioning the public sector, incorporating a vast array of materials used in public services such as education, health, social housing and transportation, have been under-researched and under-theorised in the geographical and wider social science literature on Global Production Networks, Global Value Chains and consumption ethics. Against this backdrop, the paper evaluates the emergence of ethical trading programmes involving labour standards in UK public sector sourcing, drawing on examples from the health, higher education, construction and transportation sectors and a methodology combining interviews with participant observation. Findings show that ethical public procurement is shaped, and often constrained, by: the relatively low profile of many materials used in public services, which challenge effective campaigning and advocacy work; the consequent limits to reputational risk for state departments and first-tier suppliers if labour issues are encountered in their supply chains; and the significant role of EU and UK procurement law, which until 2014 rendered social responsibility in public sector sourcing a legal risk to specify. Through a practice-orientated approach and adopting the notion of responsibilisation inspired by governmentality perspectives, the paper grasps how these challenges for ethical public procurement are encountered and negotiated by procurement managers and those influencing them in a neoliberal environment. It is shown that ethical sourcing is significantly less advanced in the UK public sector than it is in consumer goods sectors, with implications for social justice in a whole realm of under-researched global supply chains.",10.1111/tran.12274,Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers,ethical trade | global supply chains | interviews | labour standards | public sector | United Kingdom,85054484738,Public sector procurement and ethical trade: Governance and social responsibility in some hidden global supply chains,2019.0

Fairtrade is changing. The hegemonic certified system, governed by Fairtrade International, has seen some high-profile withdrawals by major processors and retailers in recent months, which is leading to both proponents and critics questioning who, and what, the system is for. While the certified system has seen increasing conventionalisation, there remains at its core a mission to make trade fair, empower those marginalised in global trade and foster sustainable livelihoods. Taking a global production network (GPN) framework supports a critical exploration of the market, social and political asymmetries of this international system of production and distribution. Drawing on empirical evidence from the wine industry, this paper uses a production-space perspective to critically reflect on some of the key relations within Fairtrade GPNs. While there are many positive impacts, particularly in social development, producers have experienced a conventionalisation of supply chains, a lack of contextual responsiveness and limited engagement with the global system. These indicate a continuation of power asymmetries that are intersecting, multiscalar and evolving. Although these are from wine industry case studies, anecdotal evidence suggests that they are not uncommon experiences and even a hint of unfair, disempowering and unsustainable trading practices negatively impacts both these producers’ livelihoods and the reputation of the Fairtrade system as a whole. Nonetheless, there remains significant producer buy-in indicating that the ideals of Fairtrade retain currency. This therefore presents a critical opportunity for Fairtrade to actively address the market, social and political inequalities that persist in its GPNs and re-establish itself as a leader in the ethical marketplace.",10.1111/area.12467,Area,Fairtrade | global production networks | power | producers | wine,85050505947,Asymmetries and opportunities: Power and inequality in Fairtrade wine global production networks,2019.0

An authoritative introspection for the sustainability of agro-economic policy in consistence with the increasing population becomes the cry of the hour of the country. Sensitivity-variance of different crops to warming though confines the scopes and preferences of territoriality of productivity however, the complexity of impact of climate-change on agricultural productivity necessitates the appraisal and interrelations of physical, economic and social factors as well changing ecological imbalances. The attempt to bring structural reforms in the farming practices in weather variability context in the country requires financial support for the marginal and small-scale farmers as farming practices are predominantly adapted to local climates. The global character of atmospheric circulation and the impact of ecological and climate-changes encourage combined use of climate, crop, and economic models for sustaining growth of supply chain to market. In addition, the increasing deterioration of agricultural production due to the eventuality of climate-change and eventual ecological imbalance considerably would affect the trade balance of the country for the legislative mandate of food security. To transform the progressive move of LPG (Liberalization, Privatization and Globalization) into secured and sustainable agro-economy to save our planet from the ravages of climate change, a comprehensive schematic approach involves configuration of legal and policy tools containing thereof: a) ‘spillover costs’ of agricultural productivity due to increased ecological and climate changes; b) coherent assessment of the modalities of agriculture to harmonize the present-day water-stressed; c) coherent financing mechanism for the farmers, in particular the small-scale and marginal ones who are not only being affected disproportionately rather the changes warrant them to be displaced internally.

These standards entail increased levels of complexity to be addressed by appropriately designed tools, such as the Voting Analytic Hierarchy Process (VAHP) proposed by Liu and Hai (2005). This method of multi-criteria group decision making structures decision criteria in a hierarchical fashion as per Saaty's Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and employs data envelopment analysis (DEA) for deriving criteria weights from the ordinal preferences of the group members. Compared to AHP, the method permits a simpler application in a group decision context. However, its theoretical underpinnings have been questioned in the literature. This specifically concerns (i) the requirement of a strong convex order for the importance weights of ordinal rank gradations, and (ii) the choice of discrimination threshold for consecutive rank weights in the underlying DEA model. We propose a revised VAHP method that overcomes both issues (i) and (ii) by pursuing a game-theoretic approach to elicitation of criteria weights — so as to remove subjectivity from rank discrimination. We illustrate the application of the method on a real-world problem of sustainable supplier selection.

Recently, finding sustainable solutions to deal with the environmental and social problems emerging from the combustion of fossil fuels in the transportation sector has attracted much interest. This paper proposes an integrated, multiperiod, mixed-integer, nonlinear programming model to design a biodiesel supply-chain network under uncertainty. To deal with the uncertainty of the parameters of the proposed model, a novel formulation of a possibilistic programming model based on possibilistic mean and absolute deviation of fuzzy numbers is proposed. The proposed model, called the possibilistic mean-absolute deviation model, utilizes not only the advantages of previous possibilistic programming methods, such as simultaneously handling the uncertainty and the flexibility in goals and constraints, but also balances mean and risk values of an objective function, including uncertain coefficients according to Decision-Maker's (DM) preferences. A real case study is conducted in Iran to evaluate the performance and efficiency of the proposed model.

More specifically, on one hand, market factors strongly influence DRC, whereas, on the other hand, both management and technical factors influence at lower level DRC. DRC has a positive influence on supply chain resilience. Flexible orientation is found to positively moderate the effect of DRC on supply chain resilience, whereas control orientation does not exert any moderating effect on DRC and supply chain resilience.

To supply high-quality tap water using the existing water-supply network, rechlorination facilities must be installed to secure residual chlorine at the pipe end. In this study, a process is developed to determine the injection points and dosages of rechlorination using the latest pressure-driven analysis. The method was compared to the results of demand driven analysis methods. The proposed model was applied to P City in Korea to draw results. A detailed evaluation was performed to study how water pressure head and demand-based hydraulic and water quality analysis results impact the injection points and dosages of rechlorination. Thus, the existing demand-based model shows significant spatial deviations in the pressure head in the presence of water pressure drops, which subsequently lead to over-estimation of chlorine injection dosages for maintaining the concentration of residual chlorine. However, the proposed model involves a numerically validated theory and draws more reasonable results for hydraulic, water quality, and rechlorination dosages.

With the large-scale development of the palm oil products industry, green supplier selection technique is the key for decision making when dealing with mass information and possible risks of biased data. For instance, the preference of decision makers possibly causes a misleading decision, thus leading to unnecessary waste of resources. Therefore, the contribution of this paper is to apply the integrated multi-criteria decision method using the 'fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory' (fuzzy DEMATEL) method to consider the cause and effect relationship and then using fuzzy analytic network process (fuzzy ANP) to assign the weight of each relevant criteria.

Increasing urban water demand and water stress conditions due to population growth, combined with climate change and a non-uniform distribution of water resources in space and time, represent major concerns for water companies. As such, long-term management strategies need to improve the resilience of water supply systems and account for the sustainability of water withdrawals. In this context, metabolic modelling may provide a support to decision-making in the medium-long term, based on sustainability criteria. This approach enables mimicking a water supply network (WSN) based on a set of material and energy fluxes that interact and influence each other. By analyzing these fluxes, a suite of key performance indicators (KPIs) is evaluated in order to identify which kind of interventions may be applied to increase the sustainability of the system. Here, we apply a metabolic model,WaterMet2, to a WSN in the Reggio Emilia Province (Italy), combined with hydraulic simulations conducted with EPANET. Different alternative strategies are compared, including a reduction of water withdrawals from the main well field due to a possible future decrease in water availability. Based on KPIs, sustainable long-term strategies are evaluated in order to identify the most suitable solution for dynamic sustainable management of the water supply system.",10.3390/w11030450,Water (Switzerland),KPIs | Metabolic modelling | Resilience; water supply network | Sustainability | Urban water system,85064895098,Sustainability analysis of alternative long-term management strategies for water supply systems: A case study in Reggio Emilia (Italy),2019.0

It is especially crucial with reference to network elements of a critical character, such as roads or water supply, sewage, or electrical networks. In urban conditions, the geometric shaping of these structures has a quasi-chaotic character that is individual for each network and city. The complexity of these networks increases significantly with the size of a city, and therefore the evaluation of water delivery certainty is also a difficult issue. Despite many years of research, there is no universal method to evaluate this certainty. The objective of this paper is to present two original approaches: the number of minimal efficiency paths from a water source to reference consumption nodes, and the relation of this number to the fractal dimension of a network's geometric structure. The developed methods were tested in the conditions of a few real water supply networks. The obtained results indicate that the analyzed methods can be used for the preliminary and relatively rapid evaluation of water delivery certainty.",10.3390/w11030480,Water (Switzerland),Distribution network | Reliability assessment | Water delivery,85064931698,Impact assessment of distribution network layout on the reliability of water delivery,2019.0

Business continuity management (BCM) forms part of supply chain risk management and is an important competitive factor for companies by ensuring the smooth functioning of critical business processes in the case of failures. If business operations are severely disrupted, the companies’ decision maker is confronted with a situation which is characterized by a high degree of uncertainty, complexity and time pressure. In such a context, decision support can be of significant value. This article presents a novel decision support methodology which leads to an improved and more robust BCM for severe disruptions caused by disasters. The methodology is part of the Reactive Disaster and supply chain Risk decision Support System (ReDRiSS) to deal with different levels of information availability and to provide decision makers with a robust decision recommendation regarding resource allocation problems. It combines scenario techniques, optimization models and approaches from decision theory to operate in an environment characterized by sparse or lacking information and dynamic changes over time.

The Authors Background: Comparatively, industry clusters in Africa have retrogressed over the years while their counterparts in Asia, Europe and America serve as engines for innovation and economic development. The textile industry cluster in most African economies has been threatened and is negatively affecting productivity, employment and revenue generation. Their survival, growth and sustainability are critical because of the sector’s contribution to national development Objective: In this ariticle we investigate the role fators such as stakeholder relation among actors in the textile ecosystem, influence of supply chain networks, third-party pressures and technological changes affected the development of textile clusters in Ghana and how the country can rebuild the clusters. Method: Using partial least-square structural equation modelling techninque, we tested theoritical hypotheses using survey data from firms in the industrial enclave of Ghana. Result: The findings from the study acknowledges a sharp decline in the productivity and performance of firms in various industrial sectors especially the textile cluster. The influx of copycat products coupled with the firm’s inability to adapt to changing production technology have been a key influencer in the deteriorating state of the textile industries. Again, gaps in stakeholder interactions and underutilised supply chain networks create bottlenecks that hinder the competitiveness and performance of these enterprises. Conclusion: On the contrary, findings from our study suggest external pressure from donors, multinationals and political influencers do not affect the performance and competitiveness of the textile sector as suggested by previous studies.

Purpose: This paper aims to address the supplier selection (SS) problem under dynamic business environments to optimize the procurement cost of spare-parts in the context of a mining equipment company (MEC). Practically, involved parameters’ value does not remain constant as planning periods due to fluctuation in the demand and their market dynamics. Therefore, dynamicity in the parameter is considered as an important factor when a company forms a responsive chain through most eligible suppliers with respect to planning periods. This area of study may be considered for their complexities to the approaches toward order-allocations with bi-products of unused and repair spare-parts. Design/methodology/approach: An integrated methodology of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and mixed-integer non-linear programming (MILP) is implemented in the two stages during each planning periods. In the first stage, AHP is used to obtain the relative weights with respect to each spare-parts of each criterion and based on that, the ranking is evaluated in accordance with case considered. And in the second stage, MILP is formulated to find the allocations of each spare-part with two distinct approaches through Model-1 and Model-2 separately. Moreover, Model-1 and Model-2 are outlined based on the ranking and efficient parameters-value under cost, limited capacities, quality level and delay lead time respectively. Findings: The ranking and their optimal order-allocation of potential suppliers are obtained during consecutive planning periods for both unused and repair spare-parts. Subsequently, sensitivity analysis is conducted to deduce the key nuggets with the comparison of Model-1 and Model-2 in the changing of capacity, demand and cost per spare-parts. From this analysis, it is found that suppliers who have optimal parameter settings would be better for order-allocations than ranking during the changing planning period. Practical implications: This paper points out the situation-specific approach for SS problem for a mining industry which often faces disruptive supplying environments. The managerial implication between ranking and parameters are highlighted through Model-1 and Model-2 by sensitivity analysis. Originality/value: It provides useful directions for managers who are involved in the procurement of spare-parts in the mining environment. For this, suppliers are selected for order-allocation by using Model-1 and Model-2 in the dynamic business environment. The solvability of the model is presented using LINGO 17.

The problem with electricity supply chain network design (ESCND) using smart grid has not been broadly explored by researchers.

The three objectives are economic (profit maximization), environmental (greenhouse gas emissions minimization), and resilience (network resilience maximization). Efficiency maximization-power loss minimization-has also been taken into account using its corresponding cost element in the economic objective function. The proposed approach accounts for different unique smart grid components such as demand side management programs, microgrid structure, two-way distribution lines, and supplier-consumer nodes, while incorporating different interrelated decisions including facility location, capacity expansion, load allocation, and pricing. To solve the resultant model, a hybrid multiobjective robust optimization technique is proposed based on cutting plane and AUGMECON2 algorithms. The proposed model and solution approach are then applied to an actual case study and the produced results are thoroughly analyzed. We find that while economic and environmental objectives can be strictly conflicting, the implementation of smart grids can result in concurrent boost in both environmental performance and network resilience.",10.1109/TEM.2017.2749638,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,Adjustable robust optimization | cutting plane algorithm | electricity | multiobjective optimization | resilience | smart grid | supply chain network design (SCND) | sustainability,85060560861,Green and Resilient Design of Electricity Supply Chain Networks: A Multiobjective Robust Optimization Approach,2019.0

Although researchers maintain that green supply chain management can bring positive financial performance, to date they have ignored the moderating role of the social control mechanism, especially in the context of China. Drawing on social exchange theory, this study aims to contribute to the literature in this field by proposing social control as an effective mechanism to strengthen the impact of green supply chain management on firms' financial performance. Today, most empirical literature in the field of green supply chain management adopts the static view and overlooks the contextual factors. This study addresses the gap by investigating the green supply chain management in an environment characterized by frequently unavoidable disruptions, and the effectiveness of social control that accommodates this complexity and dynamism. By examining green supply chain management under conditions of environmental dynamism, this study contributes to the literature of interface of green supply chain and resilience. Using a sample of 185 Chinese manufacturers, the theoretical model is empirically verified.

The primary reasons for this growing attention mainly down to the governments-driven and environmental-related regulations which has caused the overall supply cost to reduce while enhancing the customer satisfaction. Thereby, in the present study, efforts have been made to propose a facility location/allocation model for a multi-echelon multi-product multi-period CLSC network under shortage, uncertainty, and discount on the purchase of raw materials. To design the network, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model capable of reducing total costs of network is proposed. Moreover, the model is developed using a robust fuzzy programming (RFP) to investigate the effects of uncertainty parameters including customer demand, fraction of returned products, transportation costs, the price of raw materials, and shortage costs. As the developed model was NP-hard, a novel whale optimization algorithm (WOA) aimed at minimizing the network total costs with application of a modified priority-based encoding procedure is proposed. To validate the model and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, some quantitative experiments were designed and solved by an optimization solver package and the proposed algorithm.

To improve the productivity and the resilience of national economies, it is important to understand the drivers and the barriers of the internatiolisation of economic activities. While internatiolisation of individual economic actors is difficult to explain using traditional theories, aggregate patterns may be explained to some extent. We take a network-centric perspective to describe the extent of corporate internatiolisation in different countries. Based on Newman’s assortativity coefficient, we design a range of assortativity metrics which are appropriate in the firm network context. Using these, we quantify companies’ appetite for internatiolisation in relation to the internatiolisation of their partners. We use the Factset Revere dataset, which is provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc., that captures global supply chain relationships between companies. We identify countries where the level of internationalisation is relatively high or relatively low, and we show that subtle differences in the assortativity metrics used change the ranking of countries significantly in terms of the assortativity correlation, highlighting that companies in different countries are prone to different types of internationalisation. Overall, we demonstrate that firms from most countries in the dataset studied have a slight preference to make supply chain relationships with other firms which have undergone a similar level of internationalisation, and other firms from their own country. The implications of our results are important for countries to understand the evolution of international relationships in their corporate environments, and how they compare to other nations in the world in this regard.",10.1063/1.5082015,Chaos,,85061813912,Assortativity and mixing patterns in international supply chain networks,2019.0

These challenges include: enhancing supply network (SN)-level performance in alignment with the goals of individual SN entities; addressing the issue of limited information sharing between SN entities; and sustaining competitiveness of SNs in dynamic business environments. To this end, a multistage, multiechelon SN consisting of geographically dispersed SN entities catering to distinct product-market profiles was modeled. In modeling the SNC decision problem, two types of agents, each having distinct attributes and functions, were used. The modeling approach incorporated a reverse-auctioning process to simulate the behavior of SN entities with differing individual goals collectively contributing to enhance SN-level performance, by means of setting reserve values generated through the application of a genetic algorithm. A set of Pareto-optimal SNCs catering to distinct product-market profiles was generated using Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm&#x00A0;II.

Therefore, to bridge this gap, this current study is carried out to explain the relationship between supply chain management, supply chain risk, supply chain risk management and supply chain strategic networking. The study is a pioneer in that it investigates the mediating role of supply chain risk management and the moderating role of supply chain strategic network in the relationship between supply chain management and the supply chain risk. It is argued that the supply chain strategic network is a significant determinant of the relative supply chain risk.

Supply chain networks generally are composed of four main entity types: supplier, production centers, distribution centers and demand zones that consist of facilities whose activities involve the transformation of raw material into finished products that are later delivered from the suppliers to the end customers. Supply chain network design as the most important strategic decision in supply chain management, plays an important role in overall environmental and economic performance of the supply chain. The nature and complexity of today's supply chains network make them vulnerable to various risks. One of the most important risks is disruption risk. Disruptions are costly and can be caused by internal or external sources to the supply chain, thus it is crucial that managers take appropriate measures of response to reduce its negative effects. Recovery time of disrupted facilities and return it to normal condition can be an important factor for member of the supply chain. In this paper, a bi- objective model is developed for reliable supply chain network design under facility disruption. To solve this model, we have applied two approaches, i.e., ε constraint method as an exact method and non- dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGAII) as a meta-heuristic method.",10.30880/ijie.2019.11.06.009,International Journal of Integrated Engineering,Bi-objective Programming | Disruption Risk | Recovery Time | Reliability | Supply Chain Network Design,85076016376,A bi-objective programming model for reliable supply chain network design under facility disruption,2019.0

Notwithstanding, supply chain managers lagged behind this target overlooking green development in considering environmental impact which has become a main criterion in supply chain management. Where the era of greenness threatens current supply chain partners with the need to either cope with the new green regulations or leave the field for new players. Thus, an approach to design supply chains that are simultaneously resilient, and green is needed. This study satisfies this need by developing a green and resilient (G-resilient, here after) fuzzy multi-objective programming model (GR-FMOPM) to present a G-resilient supply chain network design in determining the optimal number of facilities that should be established. The objectives are minimization of total cost and environmental impact and maximization of Value of resilience pillars where robustness, Agility, Leanness and Flexibility (V-RALF) can be seen four of main pillars required for supply chain resilience. Fuzzy AHP is used for determining the importance weight for each pillar followed by a usage of a Fuzzy technique for assigning the importance weight for each potential facility with respect to RALF. The importance weights obtained by Fuzzy AHP and the Fuzzy technique are then integrated in the third objective (maximization of V-RALF) to maximize the value of resilience pillars.

Temporal business environment fluctuations cause disruptions that require quantitative risk analysis tools to understand and mitigate supply chain risks. This paper presents the formulation and application of the dynamic flow Bayesian networks (DFBNs) and the optimised dynamic flow Bayesian networks (ODFBNs) for a three-stage supply chain. DFBNs are created by integrating dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) and system dynamics (SD) to demonstrate the feedback flows of a supply chain with systemic risks considered. ODFBNs that incorporate mathematical optimisation with the original DFBNs are also developed to generate an optimisation-enhanced risk-influenced dynamic flow analysis. DFBN and ODFBN provide supply chain practitioners with a more effective reference for their business strategy.

At the same time, proactive supply chain design with disruption risk considerations frequently leads to a network redundancy which implies some resource reservations in anticipation of possible disruptions. Even if resilient supply chain design has received much attention in literature, there is a research gap in designing both resilient and sustainable supply chains. This study contributes to closing the given gap by proposing a novel methodological approach to modelling network redundancy optimization. This allows for simultaneous computation of both optimal network redundancy and proactive contingency plans, considering both supply dynamics and structural disruption risks. The novelties of this study are the integration of sustainable resource utilization and SC resilience based on coordination of structure- and flow-oriented optimization. The model uncovers a practical approach to analyze and optimize supply chain redundancy by varying processing intensities of resource consumption in the network according to supply and structural dynamics. This makes it possible to explicitly include the dynamics of resource consumption for contingency plan realization in disruption scenarios.",10.1007/s10479-019-03182-6,Annals of Operations Research,Decomposition | Linear programming | Logistics network | Optimization | Risk management | Supply chain | Sustainability,85062732569,Optimization of network redundancy and contingency planning in sustainable and resilient supply chain resource management under conditions of structural dynamics,2019.0

Today's business environment is complex, dynamic, and uncertain which makes a supply chain facility increasingly vulnerable to disruption from various risk accidents as one of the main threats to the whole supply chain's operation. However, in general, most of the studies on facility location problems assume that the facilities, once built, will always run availably and reliably. In fact, although the probability is very low, supply chain disruptions often incur disastrous consequences. Therefore, it is critical to account for disruptions during designing supply chain networks. To accomplish planned outcomes and greater supply chain resiliency, this article proposes a continuous approximation approach based on regular hexagon partition to address the reliable facility location problems with consideration of facility disruptions risk. The optimization goal is to determine the best facility location that minimizes the expected total system cost on the premise that the supply chain network is not disrupted as a whole when one or some facilities are subject to probabilistic failure. Our numerical experiment discusses the performance of the proposed solution approaches which demonstrates that the benefits of considering disruptions in the supply chain design can be significant. In addition, considering the impact of disruption probability estimation error on the optimal decision, the misestimating of the disruption probability is also investigated in this paper.",10.1155/2019/5280161,Complexity,,85062340654,A Continuous Approximation Approach Based on Regular Hexagon Partition for the Facility Location Problem under Disruptions Risk,2019.0

In today's complex market competition environment, a high quality and high level of service plays a critical role in obtaining and maintaining long-term sustainable competitive advantage for enterprises and supply chains. Considering the service negative spillover effect, this paper investigates the horizontal Stackelberg competition and optimal service decision in two competing manufacturer-led supply chains. Four competitive structure models are constructed and the corresponding equilibrium solutions are obtained. By comparing the equilibrium results of four different structures, it is found that the service negative spillover effect and competition between supply chains have negative incentive effect on service providers and their supply chains. However, the chain-to-chain competition will benefit the supply chain that does not provide services from free-riding effect, which will be intensified with the intensification of competition. In addition, from the perspective of supply chain network and externality, we find that when the structure of one supply chain remains fixed and the other changes from centralized to decentralized, there will be a ""double marginalization"" effect. At the same time, the structural change from centralized to decentralized has certain ""altruism"", that is, positive network externality, so as to improve the rival's performance significantly.",10.3390/su11061612,Sustainability (Switzerland),Competition | Negative spillover effect | Service | Supply chain,85063466453,Decisions of supply chain considering chain-to-chain competition and service negative spillover effect,2019.0

Additionally, preservation increases the lot size, thus increasing the production cycle length, which reduces the ordering cost of the system. Furthermore, this study shows that preservation leads to a reduction of solid waste from deteriorated products. Total deteriorated products reduced to 8 units from 235 units, hence, preservation generates positive environmental benefits along with economic impacts.

Recent studies have indicated that changes and disruptions within such networks can serve as indicators for increased risks of violence and armed conflicts. This is especially true of countries that may not be able to compete for scarce commodities during supply shocks. Thus, network-induced vulnerability to supply disruption is typically exported from wealthier populations to disadvantaged populations.

The Internet of Things (IoT) promises a revolution in the monitoring and control of a wide range of applications, from urban water supply networks and precision agriculture food production, to vehicle connectivity and healthcare monitoring. For applications in such critical areas, control software and protocols for IoT systems must be verified to be both robust and reliable. Two of the largest obstacles to robustness and reliability in IoT systems are effects on the hardware caused by environmental conditions, and the choice of parameters used by the protocol. In this paper we use probabilistic model checking to verify that a synchronisation and dissemination protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is correct with respect to its requirements, and is not adversely affected by the environment. We show how the protocol can be converted into a logical model and then analysed using the probabilistic model-checker, PRISM. Using this approach we prove under which circumstances the protocol is guaranteed to synchronise all nodes and disseminate new information to all nodes. We also examine the bounds on synchronisation as the environment changes the performance of the hardware clock, and investigate the scalability constraints of this approach.",,Electronic Communications of the EASST,Critical systems | Formal verification | Internet of Things | Wireless sensor networks,85068501570,"Formal verification of synchronisation, gossip and environmental effects for wireless sensor networks",2019.0

To improve the performance of a supply chain network, it is essential to build a strategic and a strong relationships. As such, all firms should select the best suppliers by applying appropriate methods through different selection criteria. An appropriate supplier reduces all purchasing costs as well as increases customer satisfaction to improve the final product and strengthen corporate competitiveness. Due to the natural uncertainty of this dilemma, most of recent works show a great deal of interest in applying uncertainty approaches. The main innovation of this paper is to develop a new multi-objective model for both supplier selection and order allocation operations considering incremental discount in a fuzzy environment. The proposed model considers the material cost with incremental discount and the transportation cost, holding costs along with its control and interest as well as the possibility of payment, brought back, and replacement costs, simultaneously, for the first time in this research area. Based on the proposed fuzzy model, the Zimmermann fuzzy approach is used in order to covert the model in a single objective form. Accordingly, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied to solve the proposed problem.

Improvements to the efficiency of existing technologies or practices appear insufficient for achieving sustainable development within the planetary boundaries. Disruptive, systemic and transformational changes appear necessary in order to replace existing technologies and practices to establish a sustainable economy. Such innovations often start out in niches; however, the scaling up and the ultimate replacement of current socio-technical systems requires governance to allow for the coordination of actors, the reorganization of socio-technical systems and the mobilization and allocation of resources. As governmental institutions are part of the current (non-sustainable) systems and thereby fail to provide coherent, integrated and transformative governance, we explore whether institutional innovation from non-state actors can step in to provide governance of transformation processes.

Currently, in force hygienic normative-methodical documents (SanPiN 2.2.2/2.4.1340-03, SanPiN 2.2.2/2.4.2620-10, SanPiN 2.2.4.3359-16) do not allow to objectively estimating EMF on modern workplaces of personal computers (PCs) users by and other means of information and communication technologies (ICT). Aim of the study is scientific substantiation of improvement of normative-methodical documentation on hygienic regulation and evaluation of EMF in computerized workplaces using modern ICT. Material and methods. The analytical method of evaluation of modern normative-methodical documentation regulating hygienic norms and methods of evaluation of EMF in the workplace of PC users is used. More than 11 thousand measurements of EMF levels were carried out. Results. A critical analysis of the current hygienic regulations of EMF in the workplace of PC users and other means of ICT in Russia showed they to be not scientifically justified, and the existing methodology does not allow an adequate hygienic assessing of the electromagnetic environment (EME). The main sources forming EME on modern workplaces of PC users are both PCs, and switching power supplies, network support devices (UPS), cable lines, wiring, broadband wireless access systems (base stations, Wi-Fi routers, access points, external and built-in laptops USB modems), cell phones, lamps of local and general lighting. EMFs on a workplace of PC users are characterized by complex amplitude-frequency composition: electric and magnetic fields at frequencies of 30 Hz - 300 kHz, EMF at frequencies above 300 MHz, electrostatic fields, hypogeomagnetic fields. New EMF hygienic standards at workplaces of PC users and other means of ICT are scientifically proved. Conclusion. The introduction of new regulations will ensure an adequate hygienic assessment of EMF in the workplaces of PC users in each normalized frequency band in total from all sources and will eliminate the current contradictions and shortcomings.

Agricultural University of Athens, Athens, Greece Prevention, prediction, control, and handling of bacterial foodborne diseases - an ongoing, serious, and costly concern worldwide - are continually facing a wide array of difficulties. Not the least due to that food matrices, highly variable and complex, can impact virulence expression in diverse and unpredictable ways. This review aims to present a comprehensive overview of challenges related to the presence of enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus aureus in the food production chain. It focuses on characteristics, expression, and regulation of the highly stable staphylococcal enterotoxins and in particular staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA). Together with the robustness of the pathogen under diverse environmental conditions and the range of possible entry routes into the food chain, this poses some of the biggest challenges in the control of SFP. Furthermore, the emergence of new enterotoxins, found to be connected with SFP, brings new questions around their regulatory mechanisms and expression in different food environments. The appearance of increasing amounts of antibiotic resistant strains found in food is also highlighted. Finally, potentials and limitations of implementing existing risk assessment models are discussed. Various quantitative microbial risk assessment approaches have attempted to quantify the growth of the bacterium and production of disease causing levels of toxin under various food chain and domestic food handling scenarios. This requires employment of predictive modeling tools, quantifying the spatiotemporal population dynamics of S. aureus in response to intrinsic and extrinsic food properties. In this context, the armory of predictive modeling employs both kinetic and probabilistic models to estimate the levels that potentiate toxin production, the time needed to reach that levels, and overall, the likelihood of toxin production. Following risk assessment, the main challenge to mitigate the risk of S. aureus intoxication is first to prevent growth of the organism and then to hamper the production of enterotoxins, or at least prevent the accumulation of high levels (e.g., >10-20 ng) in food. The necessity for continued studies indeed becomes apparent based on the challenges to understand, control, and predict enterotoxin production in relation to the food environment. Different types of food, preservatives, processing, and packaging conditions; regulatory networks; and different staphylococcal enterotoxin-producing S. aureus strains need to be further explored to obtain more complete knowledge about the virulence of this intriguing pathogen.",10.3389/fmicb.2019.01307,Frontiers in Microbiology,Enterotoxins | Environmental factors | Food supply chain | Predictive modeling | QMRA | Regulatory mechanisms | SEA | Staphylococcal food poisoning,85069148374,The role of regulatory mechanisms and environmental parameters in staphylococcal food poisoning and resulting challenges to risk assessment,2019.0

366,"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd In today's world supply chain has become more complex due to the multiplicity of drivers created by globalization, global geopolitical risk, technological disruption, market uncertainty, mass-customization and changing laws and regulations. Supply Chain Complexity (SCC) is one of the most difficult problems in today's global supply chains and assumed as the key impediment to business performance. SCC has the significant adverse impact on competitiveness, cost efficiency, customer satisfaction, product innovation and market share. It is imperative for the focal firm and its supply chain managers to know SCC drivers causing supply chain complexity. Identification and prioritizing of SCC drivers are required for effective monitoring and controlling of supply chain management. SCC drivers can be categorized based on the origin of their generation as upstream, operational, downstream and external. This paper presents the study conducted in leading earthmoving and mining equipment manufacturing firms in India, to understand the supply chain complexities for off-road & mining equipment industries. Qualitative situation-actors-process (SAP) and learning-action-performance (LAP) model has been applied to understand and analyze the concept of supply chain complexity drivers and its dynamic behavior. Quantitatively multi-criterion decision making (MCDM) is used in prioritizing SCC drivers due to the subjectivity of drivers. An AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) study has also been done to quantify and prioritize SCC drivers for managerial decision making. This study contributes towards developing a priority ranking of SCC drivers based on its impact on overall SCC which have significant importance in supply chain strategic planning. The current research investigates evolving SCC drivers like supplier resourcing risk, supplier competence, regional strategies, shortening product life-cycle, changing customer service expectation which were not adequately addressed in existing literature.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the self-declared sustainability initiatives of the world’s four largest chocolate manufacturers (Ferrero, Mars, Mondelez and Nestlé) and the measures they take to tackle social problems within the context of establishing sustainable sourcing of cocoa in Ghana and the Ivory Coast. Global cocoa supply chains are under continuous media and public scrutiny. Recent incidents of malpractice in supply chain management have left global chocolatiers vulnerable in terms of how they deal with social issues across their global supply chain networks. Critics have argued that there is a lack of consistency and transparency between what companies say and do in upholding sustainable practices across their supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: The authors draw from the sustainable supply chain literature to develop our theoretical parameters and undertake a case-based analysis of the existing sustainability practices of these chocolatiers. Using the insights from this analysis, the authors propose a conceptual framework for a rigorous comparative assessment of self-declared sustainable sourcing initiatives of global agricultural supply chains. The methodology is qualitative and the research method is a secondary-data case study. Findings: Four main parameters were identified and used to compare self-declared initiatives, namely: social sustainability certification from respectable bodies; code of conduct for suppliers; partnerships with the primary supply chain stakeholders; and supplier collaboration programme and improvement initiatives. The case companies chosen have implemented several initiatives, but the most prominent seem to indicate the reliance on third-party certification. Not all companies adopted a supplier code of conduct. The partnerships and collaboration programmes with different associations are presented as efficient for companies as well as farmers. Improvements in the conditions of farmers are advocated as a key result. Research limitations/implications: This paper is based on self-declared secondary data. Subsequently, it is possible that the case companies did not document some practices; or that companies do not do what they claim. Practical implications: This paper provides a comprehensive framework for agricultural businesses to compare their sustainability efforts and improve the performance of their supply chains, particularly those who belong to the cocoa supply chains. The proposed framework allows an assessment of initiatives at policy, strategic, tactical and operational levels to improve social sustainability of supply chains. Social implications: This paper may help companies to think more clearly about greater transparency and provide the impetus for dealing more effectively with serious social issues in agricultural supply chains such as: child labour, child trafficking, modern slavery, etc. It may also instruct consumers to better understand what companies do as part of their sustainability agenda, alongside the communication of other features of their products, such as quality.

Organic and low-input food systems are emerging worldwide in answer to the sustainability crisis of the conventional agri-food sector. “Alternative” systems are based on local, decentralized approaches to production and processing, regarding quality and health, and short supply-chains for products with strong local identities. Diversity is deeply embedded in these food systems, from the agrobiodiversity grown in farmers’ fields, which improves resilience and adaptation, to diverse approaches, contexts and actors in food manufacturing and marketing. Diversity thus becomes a cross-sectoral issue which acknowledges consumers’ demand for healthy products. In the framework of the European project “CERERE, CEreal REnaissance in Rural Europe: embedding diversity in organic and low-input food systems”, the paper aims at reviewing recent research on alternative and sustainable food systems by adopting an innovative and participatory multi-actor approach; this has involved ten practitioners and twenty-two researchers from across Europe and a variety of technical backgrounds in the paper and analysis stages. The participatory approach is the main innovation and distinctive feature of this literature review. Partners selected indeed what they perceived as most relevant in order to facilitate a transition towards more sustainable and diversity based cereal systems and food chains. This includes issues related to alternative food networks, formal and informal institutional settings, grass root initiatives, consumer involvement and, finally, knowledge exchange and sustainability.

374,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V. Product management activities have typically focused on the innovation, acquisition, expansion and management of product lines and products. However, product deletion or discontinuation is also critical. Despite its strategic importance, product deletion has received relatively less attention in both academia and practice. Researchers have conceptually investigated product deletion, its influence on firm's resources, the factors influencing product deletion decisions, and the product deletion process. However, very few papers have related product deletion decisions to supply chain management, especially when leanness and sustainability are major objectives. This paper aims to integrate lean and sustainable supply chain dimensions with product deletion by proposing a multilevel decision model that can facilitate a product deletion decision with an objective of developing a leaner and more sustainable supply chain. The model has three major decision dimensions with 8 factors with 29 influencing determinants. The model uses an integrated analytical hierarchy/network process (AHP/ANP) and a benefits, opportunities, cost and risks (BOCR) analysis.

Several evolving factors including economic climate, green image, environment protection laws and social respolities force companies to revise their strategies. In this paper, a tire forward and reverse supply chain is designed, and a multi-objective, multi-period, multi-product mixed integer linear programming model considering uncertainty is developed. Moreover, a novel idea of integrating customer relationship management concept and supply chain management is proposed and incorporated into the mathematical modeling framework. The proposed scenario-based multi-objective model is then solved following robust optimization and revised multi-choice goal programming approaches. In order to discuss the managerial implications of the model and its results, the realization rates of the objectives, considering their importance to the supply chain, are illustrated. The model is implemented in LINGO 9 software package and solved utilizing the branch-and-bound method.

376,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V. When managing a global supply chain, one critical challenge encountered by multinational enterprises (MNEs) is the extension of corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices to suppliers in emerging countries. In this study, we use a multi-method approach to explore 1) the nature of suppliers’ CSR heterogeneity based on the various components of CSR in emerging countries, and 2) the choices of MNEs for extending CSR to different types of suppliers in dynamic environments. We begin with a survey of Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) servicing MNEs to examine how these suppliers vary in CSR implementation based on cluster analysis results. To understand the choices made by MNE buyers for extending CSR to their OEM suppliers, we conduct an agent-based simulation study considering the dynamics of a system with multiple agents (i.e., MNE buyers, OEM suppliers, and the government). The cluster analysis results show that CSR practices implemented by Chinese OEMs differ significantly from one another and can be classified into three clusters (i.e., Leader, Follower, and Laggard). The simulation results provide insights into how the adaption costs (e.g., upgrade cost and cost saved by downgrading) and punitive (inspection with possible penalties) and supportive (subsidies) tactics adopted by the government affect the choices made by MNE buyers for extending CSR practices to suppliers in emerging countries. Moreover, we demonstrate when supportive tactics are more effective than punitive tactics under varying conditions and extend the model to investigate the consequences of switching between these two types of tactics in a sequential simulation.",10.1016/j.jom.2018.05.003,Journal of Operations Management,Emerging country | Empirical analysis | Extending corporate social responsibility | Multi-agent simulation | Multinational enterprise buyer | Original equipment manufacturer supplier,85047303417,Multinational enterprise buyers’ choices for extending corporate social responsibility practices to suppliers in emerging countries: A multi-method study,2018.0

It has been estimated that about 35% of food consumption depends directly on the pollination of fruit and vegetable crops. A Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) case-study is applied in the agro-food sector to assess the social and socio-economic aspects of the life cycle of honey through the Subcategory Assessment Method (SAM). The objectives of this paper are three-fold: i) evaluate the capability of S-LCA to capture the complexity of a multifunctional product, which delivers fundamental ecosystem services with consequences at environmental, economic and social levels; ii) identify how to define and represent, with robust indicators, the positive social aspects generated by honey life cycle; iii) identify the steps to improve the S-LCA methodology, especially for its application to complex product systems, such as the agri-food ones. This paper presents a methodological framework to support decision makers in order to evaluate the social sustainability of the Italian honey sector. The presence of positive social aspects in the life cycle of a jar of honey was highlighted as well as a strong connection between the honey product and local community. Furthermore, a weak relation between suppliers along the entire supply chain emerged.

Purpose: This study aims to present a competitive advantages framework suited for disaster prone regions in the era of climate change, present supply chain cooperation (SCC) as an integral part of GrSCM within the automobile industry and evaluate the competitive advantages framework merits based on SCC as a new implementation tool. Design/methodology/approach: In an effort to address limited green supply chain management implementation strategies in disaster prone regions, the paper presents SCC as an economic, social and political implementation tool. To explore this; the study introduces SCC in a three-phase competitive advantages model adopted from the Barney 1995 model (with slight differences). Smart PLS 3.0 software package was adopted to carry out multi-variable data analysis. The study’s assumption is a capital economic system and bases its argument of analysis on stockholder theoretical lenses. Findings: Big company size does not significantly affect SCC, suggesting that companies of all size can organize and enhance their network to be cooperative. Companies with cooperative supply chain network tend to have competitive advantages. SCC is also a viable way to manage business risks, be there internal or external. Research limitations/implications: One of the study’s limitation is the stockholder theory it adopts, which shoulders its assumptions on a capital economic model of operation. Indeed, the study covered China, which is seen to be a communist-based economy. Another study’s limitation is that it narrows its data collection to disaster prone areas as documented by Guha-Sapir et al. (2012). Consequently, the findings of this study might be only applicable to areas that experience significant level of disruptions usually caused by disaster incidents. Originality/value: The study is also the first of its kind to propose a model for automobile manufacturing in disaster prone regions.

383,"© 2018, Springer Nature B.V. The costs associated with inspecting wind turbines are high due to their size and complexity. One potential method by which such costs can be reduced, is through the development of robust systems that can monitor the conditions of wind turbines remotely. This study proposes embedding sensors into wind turbines to monitor the conditions of the wind turbines throughout their life cycles. The information retrieved from these sensors could be helpful in two ways: It could facilitate the provision of predictive maintenance for the turbines and enhance the performance of end-of-life (EOL) processing operations. During the maintenance phase, sensors can help to predict failures before they occur because they provide condition information about the products. During the EOL processing phase, they help to improve disassembly and inspection operations. Therefore, the use of embedded sensors in wind turbines could potentially reduce maintenance costs and increase EOL profit. This study compares regular and sensor-embedded wind turbine systems, which are modeled using discrete event simulation. A design of experiments study was carried out on the models. During the experimental stage, while conducting experiments, key variables, such as maintenance cost, disassembly cost, inspection cost, and EOL profit, were monitored. At the analysis stage, pairwise t-tests were performed to determine the statistical significance of the results.

Setting up a RSC process is not popular in the Indian sector. There are several factors that basically control the profitability of such kind of business. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to develop a causal model among the identified issues and sub-issues for setting up a RSC in an Indian semiconductor manufacturing industry and then evaluate the critical issues based on the causal relations. Design/methodology/approach: Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method along fuzzy set theory is used to develop the causal framework among the identified strategical and tactical issues. According to the causal relations from DEMATEL, analytical network process is then used to identify the weights of the sub-issues. Findings: The cause–effect interactions among the main issues show that legislations and regulations, market-related issues and organizational issue are the most significant strategic issues. Uncertainty in the acquisition time is the most significant tactical issue because it has a crucial impact on the quality and quantity of the used products. Based on the obtained causal relations of the main issues, it is identified that the reduction of waste, creation of new opportunity, market competition, cost reduction, change in technology and location, capacity and number of recovery facility are the major sub-issues in RSC implementation. Practical implications: This study is conducted on the basis of the experts’ opinion from a semiconductor manufacturing industry, situated in the southern part of India. Therefore, this proves its practical implications.

The main natural resources investigated include crops, forestry, rangeland, aquatic products, coal, crude oil & natural gas, ferrous metal ores, nonferrous metal ores, nonmetallic minerals and other primary energy, and exergy is adopted as a common metric for the resource accounting. In 2012, the total domestic resource exergy input into Chinese economic system amounted to 130.1 EJ, of which 44.6% was induced by investment demands. The embodied resource use (ERU) in China's exports was equivalent to over one fifth of its domestic resource supply. The two integrative sectors of Manufacturing and Construction accounted for 44.1% and 28.7% of the national total ERU, respectively. We identified critical supply chain paths starting from resource extraction to final demand, as well as key industrial sectors in driving the extraction, transmission and final use of embodied resources. The top 50 paths were responsible for 30.4 EJ of the ERU. The identification of resource supply chains from a systemic perspective is of great importance when resource and environmental policies are to be applied to concrete industrial sectors and other economic agents.

The authors then focus and prognosticate on the future of outsourcing and develop several compelling ideas based on extant insights and the rule of three axioms. Design/methodology/approach: The insights are developed based on a review of the extant literature and evolution of trends. Findings: The paper generates several insights. First, there is a need to carefully differentiate between core and non-core functions when deciding on whether/what to outsource. Some outsourcing options may boost financial performance in the short run but undermine the long-term viability of the firm. Public firms outsource more than private firms after controlling for size. In many cases, the optimal number of primary suppliers for a critical function/process/stock keeping unit (SKU) is three (while also allowing for a number of secondary suppliers). The optimal share distribution between the suppliers for the same SKU is rank ordinal (i.e. not equal). The complexity and the maturity of the supply chain as well as industry life cycle, regulation and technology influence the optimal number of primary suppliers. Research limitations/implications: The insights have significant implications for outsourcing decisions and for improving their impact on firm performance. The emergence of the shared economy, subscription-based business models and crowdsourcing will lead to consumers, business and society that increasingly borrows rather than one that makes or buys. Originality/value: The paper represents the first attempt to integrate the axioms of the rule of three with the outsourcing literature and the theory of the firm.

For establishing a large-scale of smart infrastructure to merge data, information, products, physical objects and all processes of supply chain, we applies the internet of things (IOT) in supply chain management (SCM) through building a smart and secure system of SCM. We have prepared a website for suppliers and managers. We tracked the flow of products at each stage in supply chain management through the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. Each product attached with RFID tag and scanned through RFID reader and ESP8266 at each phase of supply chain management. After scanning the tag we stores tag id in the database. All information about products will be entered by suppliers and then uploaded to managers. In our system the supplier and manager gets perfect information of the entire life cycle of goods, and this will achieve transparency of supply chain management. For assessing security criteria of proposed system of supply chain management, we also proposed a framework which integrates neutrosophic Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (N-DEMATEL) technique with analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The neutrosophic Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (N-DEMATEL) technique is utilized to infer cause and effect interrelationships among criteria of smart supply chain security requirements.

Background: Drug counterfeiting is a global problem with significant risks to consumers and the general public. In the Philippines, 30% of inspected drug stores in 2003 were found with substandard/spurious/falsely-labeled/falsified/counterfeit drugs. The economic burden on the population drug expenditures and on governments is high. The Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) encourages the public to check the certificates of product registration and report any instances of counterfeiting. The National Police of Philippines responds to such reports through a special task force. However, no literature on its impact on the distribution of such drugs were found. Blockchain technology is a cryptographic ledger that is allegedly immutable through repeated sequential hashing and fault-tolerant through a consensus algorithm. This project will develop and test a pharmacosurveillance blockchain system that will support information sharing along the official drug distribution network. Objective: This study aims to develop a pharmacosurveillance blockchain system and test its functions in a simulated network. Methods: We are developing a Distributed Application (DApp) that will run on smart contracts, employing Swarm as the Distributed File System (DFS). Two instances will be developed: one for Ethereum and another for Hyperledger Fabric. The proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm of Ethereum will be modified into a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) or practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm as it is scalable and fits the drug supply chain environment. The system will adopt the GS1 pedigree standard and will satisfy the data points in the data standardization guidelines from the US FDA. Simulations will use the following 5 nodes: for FDA, manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, and the consumer portal. Results: Development is underway. The design of the system will place FDA in a supervisory data verification role, with each pedigree type-specific data source serving a primary data verification role. The supply chain process will be initiated by the manufacturer, with recursive verification for every transaction. It will allow consumers to scan a code printed on the receipt of their purchases to review the drug distribution history. Conclusions: Development and testing will be conducted in a simulated network, and thus, results may differ from actual practice. The project being proposed is disruptive; once tested, the team intends to engage the Philippine FDA to discuss implementation plans and formulate policies to facilitate adoption and sustainability.",10.2196/10163,Journal of Medical Internet Research,Blockchain | Counterfeit drugs | Distribution | Information systems | Supply,85096028707,Blockchain technology for detecting falsified and substandard drugs in distribution: Pharmaceutical supply chain intervention,2018.0

Since biomass and bio-waste to energy systems condense activities that have important socio-economic and environmental sustainability effects, it is important that viability and impact studies have a socio-economic dimension, beyond the techno-economic and institutional aspects. This is necessitated in particular, by the limited and scattered availability of biomass or its residues, links to agricultural and forestry activities and associated socio-economic sustainability issues like land use, harvesting, transporting and economic conversion plant supplies. Such socio-economic studies, done prior to the project, can reflect a lot on the feasibility of projects, likely impacts and even help to optimize facility locations, network configurations or fleet management at various points or on the whole the supply chain. When the studies are done in retrospect of the project, as impact studies, they show how bioenergy projects can transform societies. The impact studies can then be useful precursors to similar projects within the same country/region or other similar regions. This review classifies socio-economic study literature into ‘viability’ studies-done prior to the project; and ‘impact’ studies-usually done after the project, except for ‘projected impact studies’. The studies are also classified as ‘quantitative and systematic’ or ‘qualitative’. Nonetheless, there are occasional overlaps between these study class-es. Intentionally designed integrated approaches could actually give more comprehensive results, although in most cases, they result in complex models. This classification can guide researchers to make the right choice of the socio-economic study to carry out based on their objectives.",10.31025/2611-4135/2018.13687,Detritus,,85085487629,A critical taxonomy of socio-economic studies around biomass and bio-waste to energy projects,2018.0

The situation requires a thorough examination of how water is utilized across various departments that use water. This paper reports on an examination of the water footprint and economic water productivities of the wheat-bread value chain. The assessment methodology of the Water Footprint Network was employed. The findings reveal that 954.07 m3 and 1026.07 m3 of water are utilized in the production of a ton of wheat flour in Bainsvlei and Clovelly in South Africa. The average water footprint for wheat bread was 954.53 m3 per ton in Bainsvlei and 1026.53 m3 per ton in Clovelly. More than 99% of the water is used in producing the grain at the farm level. The processing stage of the value chain uses less than 1% of the total water footprint. About 80% of all the water utilised along the wheat bread value chain is attributed to blue water. The findings revealed a significant shift from green water consumption to higher blue water use, and this is a major concern for water users and stakeholders along the wheat-bread value chain, given that blue water is becoming scarce in South Africa. The groundwater contributes about 34% and 42% of the average total water footprint of wheat at the farm level in Clovelly and Bainsvlei, respectively, suggesting the need to have an idea of the contribution of groundwater in water footprint evaluation and water management decision of farmers. This insight will aid in minimizing irrigation water use and pressure on groundwater resources. A total of ZAR 4.27 is obtained for every m3 of water utilized along the wheat-bread value chain. Water footprint assessment has moved away from sole indicator assessment, as a deeper awareness of and insight into the productive use of water at different stages has become vital for policy.

The local food system is visualized using geo-social data from 110 farms and 224 markets around Baltimore County, Maryland, with 699 connections between them. Network behavior is explored through policy document review and interviews. The findings revealed a small-world architecture, with system resiliency built-in by diversified marketing practices at central nodes. This robust network design helps to explain the long-term survival of local food systems despite the meteoric rise of global industrial food supply chains. Modern alternative food networks are an example of a movement that seeks to reorient economic power structures in response to a variety of food system-related issues not limited to consumer health but including environmental impacts. Uncovering the underlying network architecture of this sustainability-oriented social movement helps reveal how it weaves systemic change more broadly. The methods used in this study demonstrate how social values, social networks, markets, and governance systems embed to transform both physical landscapes and human bodies. Network actors crafted informal policy reports, which were directly incorporated in state and local official land-use and economic planning documents.

In the supply chain realm, Reverse Logistics (RL) is a feasible strategy to comply with environmental regulations because it can contribute to increasing resource-efficiency by recollecting and refurbishing leftover wastes. However, RL unavoidably causes environmental burdens due to the uses of transportation vehicles. Thus, it is critical to develop an environmentally-conscious transportation model that can improve resource-efficiency through reducing subsidiary materials under given circumstance. Additionally, such the model’s environmental performance should be quantitatively analyzed through a common methodology, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). However, the dynamic, various and complex characteristics in RL are major obstacles of the application of LCA, which is mainly targeted at static product systems.

This study combined the input-output clustering analysis and structural path betweenness analysis, and identified critical sectors belonging to important emission clusters in the global supply chain networks associated with final demand of transport equipment in five countries (United States, China, Germany, Japan, and France). Clustering analysis can divide the groups constructing the strong connecting supply chain with large emissions from the global supply chain network, and structural path betweenness represents how much CO2 emissions from the supply chain paths a sector has in global supply chain network. I applied the combined method to the EORA database which covers 189 countries and focused on the whole global supply chain networks in detail. The results demonstrate that the global supply chain networks of transport equipment were well separated into emission clusters with higher emissions that consist of sectors with higher structural path betweenness. Chinese emission clusters were identified from the global supply chain networks for the five countries in question and the betweenness of Chinese sectors tend to be higher values in the supply chain networks.

This paper addresses the strategic–tactical SC planning decisions (i.e., SC network design and master planning) in an uncertain environment for allied SCs belong to a single corporate. First, a fuzzy mixed-integer mathematical programming model that considers the imprecise nature of critical parameters such as cost coefficients, capacity levels, market demands is developed for integrated design of two SCs. Then, a robust possibilistic programming model is proposed to cope with the inherent uncertainty in the model parameters. The proposed model is able to achieve significant cost synergies via integrating the design of corporate SCs.

The waste in the perishable goods supply-chain has prompted many global organizations (e.g.; FAO and WHO), to develop the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) protocol that ensures a high degree of food quality, minimizing the losses in all the stages of the farm-to-fork chain. It has been proven that good warehouse management practices improve the average life of perishable goods. The advances in wireless sensors network (WSN) technology offers the possibility of a “smart” storage organization. In this paper, a low cost reprogrammable WSN-based architecture for functional warehouse management is proposed. The management is based on the continuous monitoring of environmental parameters (i.e.; temperature, light exposure and relative humidity), and on their combination to extract a spatial real-time prediction of the product shelf life. For each product, the quality decay is computed by using a 1st order kinetic Arrhenius model to the whole storage site area. It strives to identify, in a way compatible with the other products’ shelf lives, the position within the warehouse that maximizes the food expiration date. The shelf life computing and the “first-expired first-out” logistic problem are entrusted to a Raspberry Pi-based central unit, which manages a set of automated pallet transporters for the displacement of products, according to the computed shelf lives. The management unit supports several commercial light/temperature/humidity sensor solutions, implementing ZigBee, Bluetooth and HTTP-request interfaces. A proof of concept of the presented pro-active WSN-based architecture is also shown. Comparing the proposed monitoring system for the storage of e.g.; agricultural products, with a typical one, the experimental results show an improvement of the expected expiration date of about 1.2 ± 0.5 days, for each pallet, when placed in a non-refrigerated environment.

In this model, the uncertain demand is assumed as a function of price offered to the customers by the supply chain and its rival. The proposed model determines outsourcing strategies, pricing decisions that maximize the total profit in such a competitive situation and minimizes the amount of CO2 emissions by production processes.

This study contrasts these vague and general factors proposed as critical to LCM in existing literature, with detailed accounts of LCM in practice. Methods: A literature review of three related research fields, i.e., LCM, life cycle thinking, and sustainable supply chain management, is contrasted with a study of how LCM is enacted in practice in a large multinational manufacturing company recognized for its LCM work. A qualitative study, with mainly a managerial focus, is conducted based on interviews, workshops, part-time observations, and document studies. Results and discussion: The literature review demonstrates that the three related research fields provide different accounts of LCM: all apply a holistic environmental perspective, but with different emphases and using largely different research methods. The empirical study shows that integration was a common topic at the studied company and that solutions were often sought in tools and processes. Middle management support proved important, and challenging, in these integration efforts. Challenges identified also included further integrating LCM into departments such as purchasing and sales. Conclusions: The constant focus on integration at the studied company implies that LCM work is an ongoing effort. Several integration paths are identified: (1) inclusion of sustainability aspects in tools and processes, (2) finding ways to work around certain organizational levels, and (3) using networks and social interaction to create commitment and integration. Although the concept of LCM implies a holistic approach, LCM in practice reveals a lack of a comprehensive overview of LCM-related initiatives and of involved sustainability practitioners within the studied organization.",10.1007/s11367-014-0818-y,International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,Environmental life cycle management (LCM) | Integration | Networks | Organization | Practice-oriented | Product chains | Sustainability,85098041366,Organizing life cycle management in practice: challenges of a multinational manufacturing corporation,2018.0

This paper considers the closed loop supply chain network design problem under hybrid uncertainty, while there are two sources of uncertainty for most parameters, thus require fortifying of the robustness of the decision. The first source is that some uncertain parameters may be based on the future scenarios which are considered according to the probability of their occurrence. The second source is that the values of these parameters in each scenario are usually imprecise and can be specified by possibilistic distributions. In this case, the best robust decision has some additional properties in terms of mean value and variability of the objective function. We introduced two types of the variability named scenario variability and possibilistic variability. Possibility theory is used to choose a solution in such a problem and a novel robust fuzzy stochastic programming approach is proposed that has significant advantages.

Design/methodology/approach: This study is an exploratory case study of the South Australian (SA) mining industry that includes 38 semi-structured interviews with the key stakeholders and structural analysis of the regional supply network (RSN). Findings: Findings demonstrate the applicability of the CAS framework as a structured approach to the governance of the mining industry regional supply chains. In particular, the findings exemplify the relationship between RSN governance, its structure and interconnectivity and their combined impact on the adaptability and resilience of mining regions. Research limitations/implications: The data set analysed in the current study is static. Longitudinal data would permit a deeper insight into the evolution of the RSN structure and connectivity. The validity of the proposed framework could be further strengthened by being applied to other industrial domains and geographical contexts.

The purpose of this study is to explore how these social networks influence the implementation of sustainable SCM. In doing so, this study aims to critically investigate the constructs of guanxi networks, their impact on flow of supply chain capital and how this leverages the implementation of sustainable SCM. Design/methodology/approach: Two systematic literature reviews are conducted to understand the constructs of social networks in Confucianist culture and their impacts on the flow of supply chain capitals. The reviews also analyse evidence related to the economic, social and environmental practices to reveal the current state of the literature and research gaps. Propositions and a framework are developed to support future research in this area. Findings: The constructs of ganqing, renqing, xinren and mianzi in guanxi networks have expanded the contexts of social networks in Western literature. Guanxi networks increase the flow of supply chain capital and generate trust between players, thus enhancing capabilities to implement sustainable SCM. Guanxi networks also create the mechanism of network governance with which to increase sustainable SCM implementation under the institutional logics of sustainability. Research limitations/implications: The conceptual framework and justification are based on the reviews of current studies in the field. Future empirical study is encouraged to test the propositions, both in Confucianist culture and other countries with culture of social networks. Originality/value: Social networks are socially constructed concepts. The constructs of guanxi networks revealed in this study have developed the knowledge of Western-based social network theory.

Investments in a supply chain (in distribution centers, stores, and with suppliers) face risk when buyer-supplier contracts do not adequately address the elements responsible for a sustainable exchange relationship. Supply chains become vulnerable due to natural and man-made catastrophes and due to ineffectiveness in operations. Contracts form the basis for communication and relationship management between a buyer and a supplier. We provide an analytical framework that addresses supply chain effectiveness (costs, risks, transaction costs, stakeholder issues) and would help inform managers who grapple with such concerns. We propose three factors (costs, benefits, and risks) that capture the objective nature and one parameter that deals with the subjective nature of sustainable contracts. To illustrate the framework we collect representative cost (objective) data from suppliers, integrate behavioral (subjective) elements, and employ constrained optimization techniques to compare five supplier-engagement contract policies. We then refine this cost-based solution, for a given contract policy, to develop three cost-benefit-risk trade-off formulations and illustrate them using simulated data. The framework addresses supplier and network-based externalities, supplier and network level effectiveness, and transaction costs, and thus provides a mechanism to enable a coordinator-driven sustainable supply network. The analysis informs contract development and evaluation process and helps align buyer-supplier interest in the long-run. We believe the analysis will help build sustainable buyer-supplier relations.

Reliability is involved the capability of a network to achieve an anticipated process such as ``communication”. Analysis of network reliability has acknowledged significant consideration and is consequently broadly studied to forecast and avoid any network failure.

This paper proposes a multiobjective optimization model for a 4-layer biofuel supply chain network using mixed integer nonlinear programming while considering the benefits from economic, environmental, and societal aspects. The model can be used either to optimize an existing biofuel supply chain network or to guide the construction of a new biofuel supply chain network. The profit, the greenhouse gas emissions in transportation, and the market share of biofuel were set as targets for optimization. The selection of the participators at each layer, and the amount of the material flow between each pair of selected supplier and customer located at two adjacent layers were modeled as decision variables. The conventional weighted aggregation method was used to unify 3 objectives after normalization. Particle swarm optimization was used to solve this high-dimension multiobjective problem to obtain a near optimal solution. A numerical case study based on the state of Missouri in the United States was implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results of the case study illustrate that the benefits in terms of transportation emission, profit, and market share can be achieved simultaneously.

This article examines the role of global financial networks in articulating the nexus and in connecting it to sustainability programs. It provides new insights into critical engagements with the nexus that, to date, have focused predominantly on water security and governance. The article examines how global financial networks conceptualized and concretized the nexus towards two ends: First, the nexus was used to effect the transition from state-oriented development models to financialized approaches of water development and sustainability. Here, the nexus was formulated in critique of, and as a solution to, the previously dominant approach to water development: integrated water resources management (IWRM). Second, the nexus was deployed to connect water, energy, food, and climate to the global economy in terms of complex systems. The identification of risks to the resilience of environmental and economic systems provided a new form of integration across the supply chains affected by the governance and security of water, energy, food, and climate. In both cases, the nexus mobilizes technologies of global finance, such as credit-risk ratings, to construct and defend new strategies for governing water security and to enable sub-sovereign actors, such as municipalities, to be incorporated into the global economy. The paper concludes that alignments of the nexus with sustainability programs, and the Sustainable Development Goals, must be reconsidered in view of the constraints posed by financial orientations towards the risks and resilience of economic and environmental systems.",10.1016/j.geoforum.2018.03.001,Geoforum,Finance | Nexus | Resilience | Risk | Sustainability | Systems,85043231220,From state to system: Financialization and the water-energy-food-climate nexus,2018.0

418,"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd Food deterioration is becoming a crucial problem for most countries in the world, which may cause both economical losses and environmental damages. In this paper, a Stackelberg gaming model for a three-level food supply chain (consists of one retailer, one vendor and one supplier) with production disruption is established, which aims to study the optimal pricing, inventory and preservation decisions that maximize the individual profit. In the decentralized supply chain, upstream firms act as leaders and downstream firms as followers. Due to the mathematical complexity, an illustrative algorithm is developed to solve the problem. Numerical tests show that retailer's preservation investment not only benefits itself, but also benefits the vendor and the supplier. Comparing the optimal decisions to that in the ‘forward integration’ and ‘backward integration’ model, supply chain members’ vertical cooperation helps to enhance the total profit. Meanwhile, the carbon footprint of the food supply chain is also studied. It is found that, vertical cooperation contributes to the reduction of carbon emission. In most situations, ‘forward integration’ outperforms ‘backward integration’ strategy because it incents the retailer to invest more in preservation and reduce food deterioration. Other managerial implications are also shown in the paper.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.152,Journal of Cleaner Production,Carbon emission | Cooperative strategies | Deteriorating items | Game theory | Preservation investment,85042118892,Pricing and inventory decisions in the food supply chain with production disruption and controllable deterioration,2018.0

Concentrating on the problems of the product and network design for a multi-product, multi-echelon and multi-period CLSC, in this work a two-stage stochastic mixed integer linear model incorporating uncertainty on the quality and quantity of the return flows is proposed. In addition, risk management related to critical uncertain parameters is performed, where a conditional value at risk (CVaR) concept is applied to supply chain profits. The formulation considers decisions associated with the network design and, simultaneously, with the products to manufacture (new and remanufactured) and their associated raw materials (new and recovered). A network superstructure is considered accounting for two types of customers (first and second markets), raw material suppliers, factories, distribution centers, customer demands, recovery centers, recycle centers, final disposal locations and re-distribution centers.

Governments and global corporations increasingly both confront and rely on international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) to identify, design, and deliver interventions that prompt transformational change in societies, industries, and supply chains. For INGOs, transformational change is defined as a fundamental, long-lasting reframing of a social or industrial system through synergistically altering the knowledge, practices, and relationships of multiple stakeholder groups. With each intervention, the focal INGO assembles its own complex supply chain of nonprofit organizations and for-profit firms to provide the necessary resources and skills. While prior supply chain management literature provides a good starting point, with some generalizability to the nonprofit sector, this study begins with several key differences to explore how interventions are delivered, and then, how INGOs’ supply chains must be aligned. In doing so, at least three critical factors must be taken into account to improve alignment: stakeholder-induced uncertainty; supply chain configuration; and supply chain dynamism. By synthesizing these factors with prior literature and emerging anecdotal evidence, tentative frameworks and research questions emerge about how INGOs can better leverage their supply chains, thereby offering a basis for scholars in supply chain management to build a much richer and more nuanced research understanding of INGOs.",10.1111/jscm.12164,Journal of Supply Chain Management,nonprofit organizations | rigid resources | services | supply networks | sustainability,85045141474,EMERGING DISCOURSE INCUBATOR: Delivering Transformational Change: Aligning Supply Chains and Stakeholders in Non-Governmental Organizations,2018.0

It is estimated that recycling can avert approximately 50% annual landfill cost, while simultaneously recovering lost materials valued at 4 to 9.5% of the total logistics network cost. This study proposes a robust integrated reverse logistics supply chain planning model with a modular product design at different quality levels. A mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is formulated to maximise the profit by considering the collection of returned products, the recovery of modules and the proportion of the product mix at different quality levels. This paper proposes the collection of returnable items (end-of-life, defective and under-warranty products) through retail outlets and the appropriate recovery of modules to manage these using a network of recovery service providers. The modular product design approach is adopted to create design criteria that provide an improved recovery process at a lower cost. This robust model seeks solutions close to the mathematically optimal solutions for a set of alternative scenarios identified by a decision-maker. The efficacy of the proposed model is evaluated by a given set of variously sized numerical expressions and sensitivity analyses.

428,"© 2018 A revolution in manufacturing systems is underway: substantial recent investment has been directed towards the development of smart manufacturing systems that are able to respond in real time to changes in customer demands, as well as the conditions in the supply chain and in the factory itself. Smart manufacturing is a key component of the broader thrust towards Industry 4.0, and relies on the creation of a bridge between digital and physical environments through Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, coupled with enhancements to those digital environments through greater use of cloud systems, data analytics and machine learning. Whilst these individual technologies have been in development for some time, their integration with industrial systems leads to new challenges as well as potential benefits. In this paper, we explore the challenges faced by those wishing to secure smart manufacturing systems. Lessons from history suggest that where an attempt has been made to retrofit security on systems for which the primary driver was the development of functionality, there are inevitable and costly breaches. Indeed, today's manufacturing systems have started to experience this over the past few years; however, the integration of complex smart manufacturing technologies massively increases the scope for attack from adversaries aiming at industrial espionage and sabotage. The potential outcome of these attacks ranges from economic damage and lost production, through injury and loss of life, to catastrophic nation-wide effects. In this paper, we discuss the security of existing industrial and manufacturing systems, existing vulnerabilities, potential future cyber-attacks, the weaknesses of existing measures, the levels of awareness and preparedness for future security challenges, and why security must play a key role underpinning the development of future smart manufacturing systems.",10.1016/j.jmsy.2018.04.007,Journal of Manufacturing Systems,Cyber-physical systems | Design for manufacturing | Information security | Internet of Things | Smart manufacturing | Sustainable manufacturing,85045653026,Security of smart manufacturing systems,2018.0
429,"© 2017 For decades agricultural development has been led by a modernisation paradigm based on specialisation, intensification and scale enlargement. This model of development model has been supported by means of price support policies and, often, strong central marketing agencies, which had a stabilising effect on prices and significantly reduced market risks for an array of commodities. The economic rationale of this model is based on the pursuit of economies of scale and highly efficient technical production. This model has led farmers to increasing their technical capacity and to neglect activities such as marketing, which was delegated to specialised marketing agencies. In this paper we argue that such specialisation has weakened the economic resilience of farms. Although a high level of specialisation allows farmers to be technically efficient, acquire highly specific production skills and apply the latest production techniques, it also leads specialised farms to be highly dependent on the commodity market(s) in which they operate, increasing their economic vulnerability. As markets have become deregulated, prices of both inputs and produce have become more volatile, often compromising the economic sustainability of these specialised farms. The weakened economic resilience of such farms has been aggravated by the gradual dismantling of producer price support causing an increase in price volatility, which has become a near-universal phenomenon for almost all agricultural produce. Highly specialised farming is now only viable where markets are stable and this requires the existence of effective market agencies and strong inter-branch organisations and/or the prevalence of contract farming. The increasing market orientation of the CAP, the fragmentation and weakening of marketing agencies and – last but not least– the growing societal demand for a more sustainable agriculture have led many farmers to rethink their farm development strategies. They are rediscovering farm diversification as one way of reducing market risks, as well improving the efficiency of the farm's organisation and resource use. Economies of scope emerge when a farmer can use the same input(s) to produce two or more products, and lower the cost of producing them separately. To achieve this end the inputs have to be complementary. By developing cost complementarities between different crops or livestock species, diversified farms can become more efficient than specialised farms. Another way that diversified farms can increase their economic sustainability is to partially produce for niche markets thereby generating a higher added value. A product mix of high quality products, possibly from the same production sector, but aimed at different, specific, market segments can further contribute to increasing the overall profitability of diversified farms. This paper summarises a series of case studies from EU member states and Israel which illustrate how farmers are experimenting with alternative pathways of development based on diversification. It is also shows the challenges they face. These include learning the skills for marketing high value-added farm products, establishing short food chains and the rebuilding supportive social and economic networks. The latter is particularly important when farms are too small to diversify effectively individually. Farms that participate in these economic networks are more able to internalise external economies generated within these networks and develop their knowledge of marketing and production through close cooperation with other farms. In some of the case studies the success of diversification clearly depended on the ability of farms to collaborate and share knowledge especially when new technical capacities for say, introducing crop diversification or intercropping, needed to be acquired. The knowledge involved in developing new crop rotation patterns, knowing about crop associations and combinations of crop and livestock activities was either developed ex novo or by rediscovering traditional knowledge. At the same time training in marketing food products is also a key to successfully shifting from being a specialised farm to a diversified one. Farmers need encouragement in order to work together and share their knowledge and experiences of diversification strategies. To this end policies that support collaborative networks are needed. Policies are also required to help establish and sustain collective marketing initiatives, especially short and direct supply chains. Finally, public support to assure against market risks is very helpful when farmers are entering into new markets. These policies are essential to support the existing processes of change that are occurring at grassroots level which are leading to a new model of farm modernisation. The specific contribution that this paper makes to the rural social science literature is to empirically highlight the limitations of theories about the benefits of economies of scale.",10.1016/j.jrurstud.2017.04.013,Journal of Rural Studies,,85023632082,Specialisation and economies of scale or diversification and economies of scope?

Today's supply chains (SCs) are more than ever prone to disruptions caused by natural and man-made events with water scarcity identified as one of the highest impact events among these. Leading businesses, understanding that natural resource scarcity (NRS) has become a critical supply chain risk factor, extensively incorporate sustainable water management programmes into their corporate social responsibility and environmental management agenda. The question of how industries can efficiently evaluate the progress of these water scarcity mitigation practices, however, remains open. In order to address this question, the present study proposes a conceptual maturity model. The model is rooted in strategies for water scarcity mitigation using a framework developed by Yatskovskaya and Srai and develops an extensive literature review of recent publications on maturity frameworks in the fields of sustainability and operations management. In order to test the proposed proposed, model an exploratory case study with a leading pharmaceutical company was conducted. The proposed maturity model presents an evaluation tool that allows systematic assessment and visualisation of organisational routines and practices relevant to sustainable manufacturing in the context of water scarcity.

Nitrogen balance provides farmers with a means of demonstrating to an increasingly concerned public that they are succeeding in reducing nitrogen losses while also improving the overall sustainability of their farming operation. Likewise, supply-chain companies and policymakers can use nitrogen balance to track progress toward sustainability goals.

To achieve this goal, failure prediction that aims to pro-actively pinpoint those 'most-risky-to-fail' pipes becomes critical and has been attracting wide attention from government, academia, and industry. Different from classification-, regression-, or ranking-based methods, this paper adopts a point process-based framework that incorporates both the past failure event data and individual pipe-specific profile including physical, environmental, and operational covariants. In particular, based on a common wisdom of previous work that the failure event sequences typically exhibit temporal clustering distribution, we use mutual-exciting point process to model such triggering effects for different failure types.

438,"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd Ports are key elements of global supply chains, providing connection between land- and maritime-based transportation modes. They operate in cooperative, but competitive, co-opetitive, environments wherein individual port throughput is linked through an underlying transshipment network. Short-term port performance and long-term market share can be significantly impacted by a disaster event; thus, ports plan to invest in capacity expansion and protective measures to increase their reliability or resiliency in times of disruption. To account for the co-opetition among ports, a bi-level multiplayer game theoretic approach is used, wherein each individual port takes protective investment decisions while anticipating the response of the common market-clearing shipping assignment problem in the impacted network. This lower-level assignment is modeled as a cost minimization problem, which allows for consideration of gains and losses from other ports decisions through changes in port and service capacities and port cargo handling times. Linear properties of the lower-level formulation permit reformulation of the individual port bi-level optimization problems as single-level problems by replacing the common lower-level by its equivalent Karush Kuhn Tucker (KKT) conditions. Simultaneous consideration of individual port optimization problems creates a multi-leader, common-follower problem, i.e. an unrestricted game, that is modeled as an Equilibrium Problem with Equilibrium Constraints (EPEC).

This research develops models for closed-loop pallet pooling providers to understand the environmental and economic impact of customer characteristics and design options. First, an analytical model is developed to quantify the effects of repair facility location and pallet service conditions on a pallet pooling system's economic and environmental performance. Next, a simulation model is developed to investigate two common operational policies, crossdocking and take-back, and to quantify the impact of pallet handling and loading conditions and customer network structures on several key performance indicators. Results indicate that pallet handling and loading conditions are the most important factors determining the cost and carbon equivalent emission of a pallet pooling operation. Better pallet handling and appropriate loading increase the percentage of pallets that can be repositioned with little or no repair. This increases the radius within which a closed-loop pallet pooling system is feasible. Under random handling/loading conditions and distances, a crossdocking approach satisfies demand with 28% fewer pallets than a take-back policy. This is due to a quicker reissue time under a crossdocking approach. However, associated costs and emissions of the two policies are nearly identical due to the increased transportation costs associated with crossdocking. The models and insights proposed in this work can help support decision making by pallet pooling providers to determine operational regions and customer selection, among other network design trade-offs.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.054,Journal of Cleaner Production,Carbon emissions | Closed-loop logistics | Pallet pooling | Remanufacturing | Repositioning | Simulation,85038871058,Investigating the environmental and economic impact of loading conditions and repositioning strategies for pallet pooling providers,2018.0

The objective of the present study was the potential pathways experimental proof of concept of the sunflower meal (SFM), by-product in the sunflower oil production process, at TRL3-4 level, in an effort to assist the bio-based industries in evaluating the profitability of different possible production routes and product portfolios. Taking a reflexive approach, various processes and products were investigated, adding insights in the technical feasibility of conversion towards multi-product pathways at lab scale. Many sets of experiments were conducted in two laboratories, investigating SFM biorefining using physical, biological and thermochemical processes (fractionation, fermentation, enzymatic hydrolysis and pyrolysis) for the production of various added-value products, biochar and energy carriers. Product yields, mass balances, Effective Mass Yield (EMY) and Feature Complexity (FC) were estimated for each pathway. The study demonstrated that SFM cascade refining concept is feasible leading to the production of antioxidants, protein isolate, biochar, bioenergy carriers (pyro-oil and pyro-gas) and also poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) and microbial oil with a Feature Complexity (FC): 6-7.

In our increasingly volatile world, very unlikely events, so-called black swans, occur more often, inflicting massive damage on production environments. But there are also so-called grey swan events, equally destructive, but not utterly unpredictable. They have already occurred in the past, perhaps in related production settings. We present a dynamic model that analyses how grey swan events originate in supply networks and how they can be prevented. Most of the literature so far has focused on external risks, beyond the scope of managerial control. This paper introduces a formal model in which a central role is played by management and its inability to observe and act timely on signals of growing operational issues which cause grey swan events. The paper starts with an empirical investigation of one grey swan event, the Airbus A380 introduction. Our model can replicate this type of grey swan behaviour. With this model, we conduct a system dynamics analysis of the mechanisms that can create or prevent a particular type of grey swan event, a business tsunami. The level of managerial preparedness to actively ‘search for the grey swans’ is found to be a key prerequisite to prevent destructive impact on production supply networks.

The results of our study yield three main categories of barriers. These barriers are knowledge-related (lack of awareness of the environmental impacts on business, lack of training courses/consultancy/institutions to train, monitor/mentor progress specific to each industry, lack of technical expertise and difficulty in identifying environmental opportunities), commitment-related (lack of corporate social responsibility) and product design-related (complexity of design to reuse/recycle used products).

444,"© 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: The competitiveness of mining regions largely depends on the performance of the regional supply chains that provide services to mining companies. These local supply chains are often highly intertwined and represent a regional supply network for the industry. Individual companies often use supply chain strategies that are sub-optimal to overall supply network performance. To effectively respond to an uncertain business environment, policy-makers and supply chain participants would benefit by a governance framework that would allow to incentivise the formation of supply networks structures enabling effective operations. The purpose of this paper is to offer an empirically grounded conceptual framework based on Complex Adaptive Systems (CASs) governance principles, which links network governance mechanisms with supply network structure and operational performance to incentivise the formation of adaptive and resilient supply networks in the mining industry. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed method research design and a case study of the South Australian mining sector were used to collect empirical data. Qualitative interviews and network analysis of the SA mining industry regional supply network structure were conducted. The relationships between network parameters were interpreted using CAS theory. Findings: An empirically grounded conceptual framework based on CAS governance principles is developed. The case study revealed that supply chain strategies and governance mechanisms in the SA mining industry have led to the formation of a hierarchical, scale-free structure with insufficient horizontal connectivity which limits the adaptability, responsiveness and resilience of the regional supply network. Research limitations/implications: The findings are drawn from a single case study. This limits generalisability of the findings and the proposed framework. Practical implications: The proposed framework draws the attention of the policy-makers and supply chain participants towards the need for utilising CAS governance principles to facilitate the formation of adaptive, responsive and resilient regional supply networks in the mining industry. Originality value: The proposed conceptual framework is an attempt to parameterise the governance of the regional supply networks in the mining industry.",10.1108/JGOSS-03-2017-0007,Journal of Global Operations and Strategic Sourcing,CAS | Complex adaptive systems | Mining industry | Network-centric governance | Regional supply networks | Supply chain governance,85041343864,A supply network governance framework: a case study of the South Australian mining industry,2018.0

These identified enablers form the foundation of a questionnaire distributed among over 150 experts and staffs of a real case associated with an Iranian automotive supply chain. The reliability and validity of the questionnaire are evaluated by statistical tests and Cronbach’s alpha. Then, a hybrid of the Z-number data envelopment analysis and neural network is employed for the efficiency score calculation, separately. Finally, the associated results are combined and the final efficiency scores are obtained.

In this regard, unknown risks of network's structure can endanger the whole supply chain network's robustness. In spite of the importance of risk identification of supply chain network, firms are not willing to exchange the structural information of their network. Firms are concerned about risking their strategic positioning or established connections in the network.

While the majority of research exploring supply chain resilience has originated from a supply chain management perspective, many other disciplines (such as environmental systems science and the social sciences) have also explored the topic. As complex social, economic and environmental constructs, the priority of resilience in AFSCs goes far beyond the company specific focus of supply chain management works and would conceivably benefit from including more diverse academic disciplines. However, this is hindered by inconsistencies in terminology and the conceptual components of resilience across different disciplines. The purpose of this study is to use a systematic literature review to identify which multidisciplinary aspects of resilience are applicable to AFSCs and to generate a novel AFSC resilience framework. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a structured and multidisciplinary review of 137 articles in the resilience literature followed by critical analysis and synthesis of findings to generate new knowledge in the form of a novel AFSC resilience framework. Findings: Findings indicate that the complexity of AFSCs and subsequent exposure to almost constant external interference means that disruptions cannot be seen as a one-off event; thus, resilience must concern the ability to not only maintain core function but also adapt to changing conditions. Practical implications: A number of resilience elements can be used to enhance resilience, but their selection and implementation must be carefully matched to relevant phases of disruption and assessed on their broader supply chain impacts. In particular, the focus must be on overall impact on the ability of the supply chain as a whole to provide food security rather than to boost individual company performance. Originality/value: The research novelty lies in the utilisation of wider understandings of resilience from various research fields to propose a rigorous and food-specific resilience framework with end consumer food security as its main focus.",10.1108/SCM-06-2017-0201,Supply Chain Management,Food industry | Food security | Resilience | Supply chain disruptions | Sustainability | Systematic literature review,85044571090,Resilience in agri-food supply chains: a critical analysis of the literature and synthesis of a novel framework,2018.0

One of the most critical factors influencing the sustainability of an agro-food supply chain is its network design.

However, many of these indicators could not be fully integrated or measured by single-step optimization problems. This paper presents a critical literature review of operational research methods for the design of sustainable supply chains. A novel two-stage hybrid solution methodology is proposed. In the first stage, a partner selection is performed using a hybrid multi criteria decision making based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method and the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) aggregation method. The result obtained in the first stage is used in the second stage to develop a multi-objective mathematical model to optimize the design of the supply chain network. This approach allows the simultaneous consideration of all three dimensions of sustainability including carbon footprint, water footprint, number of jobs created and the total cost of the supply chain design. The proposed approach generates a Pareto frontier to aid users in making decisions.

In concertwith the rapidly growing Chinese economy, there is a growing demand for a sustainable Baijiu industry. Therefore, this paper constructs and optimizes a network decision-support model for a sustainable Baijiu industry network design. To achieve this, the Baijiu supply chain is examined and a model is proposed for a design that encompasses economic (costs), environmental (carbon emissions), and social (local employment and regional per capita GDP) dimensions. R language programming is then applied to solve the model. A case example indicated that S1 was the optimal decision for reducing costs, S2 was the optimal solution for minimizing carbon emissions, and S3 was the best for maximizing the social impact. Considering the situation of the Baijiu industry and the focal enterprise, it was concluded that S1 would be the best solution for the case company.

After their useful life, they become e-waste which has considerable impacts on the environment and society. To mitigate the issue, the reverse supply chain (RSC) has been investigated to reuse components or recycle raw materials contained in e-waste. The total cost of RSC operation is one of the vital issues which has been receiving more attention from both industry and academia. The existing research concentrates on minimizing the overall cost of the system like transportation, operating, disposal and fixed costs. However, risks normally involved during the transportation of e-waste in RSC network has not been addressed. These risks might involve collection delays, breakdown of trucks, accidents and the variation of hazardous materials which can result in unexpected disruptions and significantly higher cost. Currently, there is no research incorporating transportation risk in RSC operation. This paper is aimed to develop a mathematical model for the total cost minimization of an e-waste RSC system with consideration of transportation risk. A mixed integer linear programming is applied in the proposed model and solved by an optimization software. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed model, a numerical example is also examined. The results of this paper can decide the optimal locations for treatment centers and the flow of used products or components delivered within an e-waste RSC network. This result can support managers to design an e-waste RSC network whilst transportation risk factors are considered.",,Operations and Supply Chain Management,E-waste | Mixed integer linear programming | Reverse supply chain | Transportation risk,85057006441,Optimizing the total cost of an E-waste reverse supply chain considering transportation risk,2018.0

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the use, applicability and relevance of strategic planning as a process and tool when applied to exploring food security challenges, in the context of existing research on food security and food waste in the food supply chain. The issues associated with robust and resilient food supply chains within a circular economy are increasingly being seen as supportive of creating enhanced levels of food security but the authors argue that this is only sustainable when strategically planned as part of a cross-enterprise, information-rich and complex supply chain. The relevance of the Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal and Environmental (PESTLE) strategic planning tool is explored to establish whether it can play a role tacking the complexity of food insecurity (i.e. a lack of food security). Design/methodology/approach: This is a viewpoint piece therefore as a result, thought, normative literature and supposition are used as a means to ground and orientate the views of the authors. Findings: The authors identify and conclude that strategic planning tools like PESTLE across enterprises may not be relevant in supporting the reduction of food insecurity. This conclusion is predicated on the heightened level of complexity surrounding the pursuit of food security and the simplistic categorisation of PESTLE factors in a linear fashion that underpin this tool. Rather, the authors’ call for the use of strategic planning tools that are able to capture a large number of inter-related factors holistically. Practical implications: This insight to the inter-related factors that contribute to food insecurity will allow policy developers, decision makers and others to develop their understanding of how strategic planning can support increased levels of food security within a circular economy and across cross-enterprises. Originality/value: The authors contribute to the literature through a new insight of how normative strategic planning tools need to evolve in a complex, inter-connected world of international business and geo-politics. In doing so, it is expected that this research will motivate others to develop their line of enquiry around uncovering and exploring those inter-relationships connecting PESTLE factors.",10.1108/JEIM-03-2017-0045,Journal of Enterprise Information Management,Circular economy | Food security | Food supply chain | Food waste | Strategic planning,85041546969,"Food security across the enterprise: a puzzle, problem or mess for a circular economy?",2018.0

The paper aims at proposing RFID-IoT-enabled warehouse management focused on safety assurance for goods and people leveraging product class-based storage (pCBS), communicating object, RFID and IoT components. Security issues between products, storage locations, transportation equipment, environment and people are handled with the use of potential fields methods associated with smart product management in RFID-IoT warehouse architecture. A dynamic calculation of suitable storage locations is proposed, founded on negotiation mechanisms between products and shelves and their availability and compatibility constraints according to pCBS method.

Hazardous chemicals have their own intrinsic properties such as explosive, flammable, corrosive, toxicity, and radioactivity, which will lead to great threats and substantial security risks in the transportation, application and storage processes. Problems, if possibly arisen in the transportation and management processes, may cause a major accident. We have to fight through some troubles in the whole process. For this purpose, the paper designs and implements a chemical logistics supervision and forewarning system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) cloud computing, which integrates IoT technology to collect, merge and transmit geographical location information and operation conditions for chemical supply chain such as storage and distribution, environmental parameters for hazardous chemicals, monitor and analyze the transportation route safety and driver operation status. This is a real-time surveillance over the whole logistics chain for hazardous chemicals. Here analyze and aggregate the parameter thresholds of the feature elements that lead the hazardous chemicals logistics to accidents. When the platform detects there is a parameter that reaches the critical threshold, the system automatically issues a warning signal according to the preset forewarning decision program, and then takes measures for level-to-level troubleshooting against it, thereby realizing the monitoring and forewarning on the hazardous chemicals logistics. It is proved by the test that the function modules on the platform all fill the bill for the design and implementation. Given the above, this platform can well apply to monitoring and early warning for hazardous chemicals logistics.",10.3303/CET1871122,Chemical Engineering Transactions,,85059756221,Implementation of chemicals logistics supervision forewarning platform based on iot cloud computing,2018.0

P-graph provides a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient framework for solving PNS problems via the maximal structure generation (MSG), solution structure generation (SSG) and accelerated branch-and-bound (ABB) algorithms. MSG ensures rigorous generation of the maximal structure, while the ad hoc generation of a superstructure as basis for a mathematical programming model can lead to significant modelling errors. In addition, SSG allows the generation of combinatorially feasible network structures that can be utilized for practical decision-making by designers. For very large problems, ABB can reduce the computational effort of reaching globally optimal solutions by multiple orders of magnitude compared to conventional branch-and-bound solvers for Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models. In addition to conventional PNS problems, P-graph has been applied to the optimization of separation processes, Heat Exchanger Networks (HENs), Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems, chemical reaction pathways, polygeneration plants, biorefineries, and supply chains. Further non-conventional applications have also been reported, such as the optimisation of office processes, human resource networks, and economic structures at the level of cities or regions. In addition to synthesis and design problems, P-graph has also been applied to operational problems, such as determining the best abnormal operating conditions for process networks. These diverse applications suggest the potential for applying the P-graph framework as a problem-solving strategy for a broad class of generalized process networks, beyond the traditional PNS problems in chemical plant design. This paper surveys recent trends in the P-graph literature and uses bibliometric analysis to identify promising trends and discusses potential directions for novel applications for optimization of generalized process networks, particularly for applications that address critical sustainability issues.",10.3303/CET1870016,Chemical Engineering Transactions,,85051317524,Towards generalized process networks: Prospective new research frontiers for the p-graph framework,2018.0

Major accidents involving dangerous substances pose a serious threat to the health and safety of local communities and the environment, as well as to the integrity and development of infrastructure where Seveso establishments are located. In some cases, the disastrous effects may affect larger, even cross-border areas. At European level, there are continuous efforts to develop land-use planning policies and regulations to reduce consequences and to prevent future accidents from happening. Hence, research in this field comes to support the current actions and strategies of the European Commission to improve the capacity of the EU Member States to cope with and respond to the identified risks through effective prevention, preparedness and response measures. In Romania, the Seveso establishments are mostly located in or very close to urban areas. This paper analyses vulnerability in case of two different accident scenarios (explosion and toxic dispersion) in Targu-Mures, a city hosting one of the largest Seveso upper-tier establishments in Romania. The approach starts with exposure analysis - the first step in the process of vulnerability analysis - which identifies all the elements at risk, be they social (population, medical facilities, schools), environmental (protected areas, water bodies) or economic (transport infrastructure, buildings, utility and water supply networks, fuel or food storage facilities). Following the exposure analysis, vulnerability is assessed based on indicators selected in such way so that they cover the entire range of social, economic, environmental aspects, as well as the existing response capabilities in case of a major accident.",10.21163/GT_2018.131.10,Geographia Technica,Chemical accident | Dangerous substances | Exposure | Seveso establishments | Vulnerability,85044732063,Vulnerability analysis for two accident scenarios at an upper-tier seveso establishment in Romania,2018.0

In 2016, 5.6 million students were enrolled in the 34% of Brazilian schools located in rural areas, but only 72% had a public water supply network. The objective was to evaluate effectiveness of environmental intervention for water treatment in rural schools of the Western Amazonia, and determine the efficacy of water treatment using a simplified chlorinator on potability standards for turbidity, fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli. Methods: A simplified chlorinator was installed for treatment of potable water in 20 public schools in the rural area of Rio Branco municipality, Acre state, Brazil. Results: Before the intervention, 20% (n = 4), 100% (n = 20) and 70% (n = 14) of schools had water that failed to meet potability standards for turbidity, fecal coliforms and E. coli, respectively. However, after intervention, 70% (p = 0.68), 75% (p < 0.001) and 100% (p < 0.001) of schools complied with potability standards. Discussion: This intervention considerably improved schools' water quality, thus decreasing children's health vulnerability due to inadequate water. Ancillary activities including training, educational lectures, installation of equipment, supply of materials and supplies (65% calcium hypochlorite and reagents) were considered fundamental to achieving success full outcomes. Installation of a simplified chlorinator in rural schools of the Western Amazon is therefore proposed as a social technology aiming at social inclusion, as well as economic and environmental sustainability.",10.7717/peerj.4993,PeerJ,Drinking water | Escherichia coli | Intervention study | Schools | Water quality,85048540084,Drinking water and rural schools in the Western Amazon: An environmental intervention study,2018.0

It is, however, an emotive subject whereby the extent, accuracy and resolution of available data on postharvest loss and waste are questionable, such that key performance indicators on waste can be misinformed. The nature and extent of food waste differ among developed economies, economies in transition and developing countries. While most emphasis has been put on increasing future crop production, far less resource has been and is still channelled towards enabling both established and innovative food preservation technologies to reduce food waste while maintaining safety and quality. Reducing food loss and waste is a more tractable problem than increasing production in the short to medium term, as its solution is not directly limited, for instance, by available land and water resources. Here we argue the need for a paradigm shift of current funding strategies and research programmes that will encourage the development, implementation and translation of collective biological, engineering and management solutions to better preserve and utilise food. Such multidisciplinary thinking across global supply chains is an essential element in the pursuit of achieving sustainable food and nutritional security. The implementation of allied technological and management solutions is reliant on there being sufficient skilled human capital and resources. There is currently a lack of robust postharvest research networks outside of the developed world, and insufficient global funding mechanisms that can support such interdisciplinary collaborations. There is, thus, a collective need for schemes that encourage inter-supply chain research, knowledge exchange and capacity building to reduce food losses and waste. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.",10.1002/jsfa.8708,Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture,food security | fresh produce | postharvest loss | sustainability,85032740045,Minimising food waste: a call for multidisciplinary research,2018.0

471,"© 2016 Elsevier B.V. Innovative and efficient use of municipal solid waste as a source of energy is an important way to promote the transition to low-carbon cities. One key strategy to improve energy efficiency is to create a network of multiple sectors that can produce and utilize energy from waste. This mechanism has already been adopted at the urban scale in several developed countries as a way to enhance environmental efficiency and reduce adverse impacts. However, to use waste efficiently, it is necessary to examine the supply chain of wastes as a source of materials with potential to generate energy. Such an examination can inform the design of an efficient waste-to-energy process that will create a symbiosis between industry and the waste management sector. In this paper, we describe a model that evaluates energy recovery efficiency by considering the costs and benefits of an innovative waste-to-energy system. In the model, we also consider the material and energy flow of wastes in accordance with the quantity and quality of waste emissions, the separation system, treatment technologies and combinations thereof, and energy recovery and use in other sectors. The scenario was designed by identifying waste management options, including waste quantity/quality; the separation system; the treatment technology model for wet or dry methane fermentation; incineration; a combined system that involves superheating with exchanging heat between the incineration plant and fermenter; and use of refuse paper and plastic fuel (RPF). The results revealed that energy recovery efficiency was most dependent on the effective use of RPF with a relatively high lower heating value and superheating of boiler steam by methane gas in the combined system. An important conclusion was that the most efficient system was a combined system in which paper, plastic, and RPF were separated from 80% of the waste, and 20% of the waste was incinerated and used for wet methane fermentation. The amounts of energy recovered from that system was 54.5 kWh/t, and the efficiency was 33.4%. Analytical results indicated that it is possible to create the critical technology and to develop policy insights needed to make efficient waste management systems for the transition to low-carbon cities.",10.1016/j.resconrec.2016.11.018,"Resources, Conservation and Recycling",Energy recovery | Industrial symbiosis | Methane fermentation | Waste management | Waste-to-energy,85034079990,Efficient energy recovery through a combination of waste-to-energy systems for a low-carbon city,2018.0

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide an analysis of a major retailer’s transition to omnichannel retailing (OCR) from an existing multichannel retailing (MCR) base. Using the illustrative case of Seven & I (S&I) Holdings, the paper positions OCR in terms of its goal to provide added customer value through a seamless brand experience. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses a case study methodology, based on a series of in-depth interviews. Executives at S&I were interviewed as the core of the case, and supporting interviews were carried out with executives at Yamato Transport, Inditex Japan and Rakuten. Data collected in interviews were cross-referenced to industry and trade press reports, providing an illustration of the motivation and strategic decisions behind the transition to OCR, and of factors that have direct impact on the implementation of the model. Findings: The results illustrate the difficulty in achieving OCR in terms of unifying customer experience across multiple channels. The case demonstrates the potential for cross-channel integration through multiple, but integrated touchpoints, and the leveraging of existing multichannel retail infrastructure and systems. In addition to confirming previous conceptual understanding of the transition process, the core findings demonstrate the importance of the strategic implementation process, the importance of the retailer’s brand portfolio and brand management, and the need to adjust and leverage existing facilities and infrastructure. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited by the single case employed, although the complexity of OCR implementation does not take away from the practical implications in a broader sense. It could be argued that the Japanese retail industry has some differences to other markets, but the customer-orientated nature of S&I’s implementation, and its aim to leverage existing infrastructure, is illustrative for similar strategies of retailers elsewhere in the world. Practical implications: The study has value to both researchers and practitioners as a structured synopsis of an actual case of transition, and adds to the literature that relates to OCR and to Japanese distribution. It demonstrates not only the need for robust supply chain, logistics, IT, marketing and retail infrastructure, and integration across distribution systems, but also the importance of the retailer’s brand portfolio, which may need significant adjustment to best promote added customer value. The success of S&I is predicated on both the high population densities, characteristic of the Japanese market, and a strong, longstanding MCR base. Similar systems and implementation issues apply to other markets that operate under similar conditions. Social implications: The social implications of the paper relate to the fact that, although the transition to OCR may be a difficult, costly, and time-consuming proposition for a retailer, increasingly consumers are coming to expect both informational and purchasing options for brands to be available as, when and where they want them. The 24-7 nature of omnichannel also generates significant challenges in terms of work volumes and environmental impact. These issues are touched upon this paper. Originality/value: This paper provides a case of a major and well-known retailer and the transition process towards an OCR model, of which there are currently few case studies available.

474,"© 2017 IEEE. As the complexity of supply chain structures and the frequency of their disruptions rise, businesses are increasingly recognizing the value of supply chain reliability and resilience (SCRR). A number of efforts have been devoted to define SCRR or to develop risk mitigation strategies for their improvement. However, a key question remaining to be answered is how SCRR should be quantified. Existing methods are insufficient in addressing this question on two important fronts: First, they do not adequately represent the interdependencies between different supply chain nodes; second, they do not allow for the modeling of actionable decisions and thus cannot be used to guide improvement strategies. This paper aims to fill this gap by proposing a unified framework for evaluating SCRR that internalizes design inputs and is flexible to varying degrees of data availability. The proposed framework captures risks involved in the supply, the demand, the firm itself, and the external environment. It also contributes to the literature by relating SCRR to the supply chain’s risk-mitigating capabilities prior to or postdisruptions. A novel method using the supply chain’s inherent buyer–supplier relationships is designed to model node interdependencies. Two example applications are discussed to demonstrate how this framework can be utilized to assist in reliable and resilient supply chain design.",10.1109/TR.2017.2737822,IEEE Transactions on Reliability,Bayesian methods | Design | Reliability | Resilience | Supply chain management | Supply chain risk propagation | System analysis,85028729578,A unified framework for evaluating supply chain reliability and resilience,2017.0

However, occurrence of disruptions such as food, earthquake and fire could ruin performance of supply chains. Uncertainty of parameters is another important factor that could lower quality of long-Term plans of companies. Hence, uncertainty of parameters and disruption strike are important issues adversely influencing reliability of networks. Also, responsiveness of supply chains is a significant matter that should be considered carefully while designing distribution networks. Responsiveness could increase customer loyalty and satisfaction that could result in increasing market share of companies and their long-Term planned benefit. Regarding alluded matters, the aim of this paper is designing a reliable forwardreverse supply chain network that minimizes total costs of network design along with maximization of total responsiveness of distribution network. Extended closed-loop network is capable of considering environmental issues by caring about end-of-life products. Designing reverse supply chain network aside with forward ones could decrease bad environmental impact of end-of-life products. Notably, to cope with adverse effects of disruptions, a scenario-based approach is suggested that enables considering partial and complete disruption of capacity of facilities. Additionally, an effective possibilistic programming method is applied to appropriately control uncertainty of parameters. As quality of raw materials is important to produce high-quality products, minimum acceptable quality level of raw materials is considered in extended model to maximize customer satisfaction. Finally, it should be noted that designed test problems show appropriate performance of suggested model and its applicability in real world case studies.

Traditional (technical) concepts to ensure a reliable water supply, a safe handling of wastewater and flood protection are increasingly criticised as outdated and unsustainable. These so-called centralised urban water systems are further maladapted to upcoming challenges because of their long lifespan in combination with their short-sighted planning and design. A combination of (existing) centralised and decentralised infrastructure is expected to be more reliable and sustainable. However, the impact of increasing implementation of decentralised technologies on the local technical performance in sewer or water supply networks and the interaction with the urban form has rarely been addressed in the literature. In this work, an approach which couples the UrbanBEATS model for the planning of decentralised strategies together with a water supply modelling approach is developed and applied to a demonstration case. With this novel approach, critical but also favourable areas for such implementations can be identified. For example, low density areas, which have high potential for rainwater harvesting, can result in local water quality problems in the supply network when further reducing usually low pipe velocities in these areas. On the contrary, in high demand areas (e.g., high density urban forms) there is less effect of rainwater harvesting due to the limited available space. In these high density areas, water efficiency measures result in the highest savings in water volume, but do not cause significant problems in the technical performance of the potable water supply network. For a more generalised and case-independent conclusion, further analyses are performed for semi-virtual benchmark networks to answer the question of an appropriate representation of the water distribution system in a computational model for such an analysis. Inappropriate hydraulic model assumptions and characteristics were identified for the stated problem, which have more impact on the assessments than the decentralised measures.",10.3390/w9110855,Water (Switzerland),Integrated system analysis | Rain water harvesting | Urban form | UrbanBEATS | Water quality analysis,85033605385,Impact of hybridwater supply on the centralised water system,2017.0

The optimal design and planning of glycerol-based biorefinery supply chains is critical for the development and implementation of this concept in a sustainable manner. To achieve this, a decision-making framework is proposed in this work, to holistically optimize the design and planning of the glycerol-based biorefinery supply chains under uncertainties. This framework presents a multilayered strategy composed of different steps, and it is strongly based on optimization techniques, detailed economic and environmental assessment, and multiobjective optimization under a stochastic environment. To maximize the business value, the economic objective is measured by the Net Present Value (NPV), whereas the environmental performance is measured by the estimation of a Single Indicator (SI) through the application of LCA methods. As part of the framework, a stochastic multiperiod, multiproduct, and multiechelon mixed integer linear programming problem is proposed based upon a previous model, GlyThink. In the new formulation, market uncertainties are taken into account at the strategic planning level. The robustness of the supply chain structures is analyzed based on statistical data provided by the implementation of the Monte Carlo method, where a deterministic optimization problem is solved for each scenario. Furthermore, the solution of the stochastic multiobjective optimization model points to the Pareto set of trade-off solutions obtained when maximizing the NPV and minimizing environmental consequences. Therefore, the proposed framework ultimately leads to the identification of the optimal design and planning decisions for the development of environmentally conscious biorefinery supply chains. The effectiveness of the presented approach is demonstrated through its application to the realistic case study of the glycerol-based biorefinery in Europe, where the results showed that the optimal solution under market uncertainties is obtained by establishing a multiplant supply chain for the glycerol-based integrated biorefinery, built upon two plant site locations (Germany, France) based on the production of succinic acid and lactic acid.",10.1021/acs.iecr.7b02882,Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research,,85032858416,Optimal Design and Planning of Glycerol-Based Biorefinery Supply Chains under Uncertainty,2017.0

487,"© 2017 Elsevier Ltd Background There is an urgent need to drive improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of food chains. The global population is expected to reach at least 9 billion by the year 2050, requiring up to 70% more food, and demanding food production systems and the food chain to become fully sustainable. This challenge is complicated by a number of overarching issues, including increasing complexity of food supply chains, environmental constraints, a growing aging population and changing patterns of consumer choice and food consumption. Within this context, food safety must be an enabler and not inhibitor of global food security. Scope and approach This paper will highlight how recent developments and trends related to food safety will impact the food sector and ultimately the ability of the sector to deliver food security. Key findings and conclusions Global megatrends including climate change, a growing and aging population, urbanisation, and increased affluence will create food safety challenges and place new demands on producers, manufacturers, marketers, retailers and regulators. Advances in science and technology such as whole genome sequencing, active packaging, developments in tracing and tracking technologies, information computing technology and big data analysis has the potential to help mitigate the challenges and meet demands, but will also create new challenges. Overcoming a number of these challenges will be difficult for developed economies and large food companies, but even greater for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), developing economies and smallholder farmers, noting that each is a critical component in the global food supply.",10.1016/j.tifs.2017.08.014,Trends in Food Science and Technology,Food industry | Food safety | Food safety communication | Food security | Global megatrends | Regulation,85028468776,Food safety for food security: Relationship between global megatrends and developments in food safety,2017.0

There are many challenges associated with this due to the complexity at each node of Hydrogen Supply Chains (HSC), such as the number of processes to produce hydrogen. This raises the challenge to model HSCs, allowing analysis of various pathways and optimal configurations. This report aims firstly, to review the factors discussed in the literature on HSC and identify gaps or issues that require further debate with regards to introducing hydrogen in the transport system. Secondly, various HSC modelling techniques have been categorised according to mathematical methods used and the factors being considered. Studies in the literature have analysed hydrogen transport systems in terms of capital and operating costs of the infrastructure, and the cost of hydrogen, environmental implications and risk. A significant market share can be obtained by hydrogen in the near future with the minimisation of cost across the supply chain from production to end-use.

489,"© 2017 Elsevier Ltd The diversity of materials employed in modern products and the complexity of globalized supply chains raise the importance of assessing supply risk of commodity inputs to product systems. Therefore, this article extends the Geopolitical Supply Risk methodology by proposing a characterization model to quantify product supply risk in relation to a functional unit under the Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment framework. The characterization model is based on a socio-economic cause-effect mechanism drawing upon supply chain resilience concepts. Supply risk – or “criticality” – of a given “intermediate product” is defined as the multiple of probability of supply disruption and vulnerability to supply disruption. Two embodiments of the characterization model are proposed, each supplementing the previously developed probability indicators with different indicators for vulnerability. They are demonstrated with a comparative case study of an electric vehicle and internal combustion engine vehicle. The results are highly sensitive to how vulnerability is measured, and a number of methodological complications arise. The most promising embodiment of the characterization model “cancels out” the amounts of commodity inputs, as it can be strongly argued that every input to the product system is equally important for product performance as expressed by the functional unit. Thus, the Geopolitical Supply Risk characterization model shows the importance of integrating raw material criticality considerations into Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment to better inform management decisions at a product level.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.06.063,Journal of Cleaner Production,Criticality assessment | Electric vehicle | Life cycle assessment | Life cycle sustainability assessment | Product supply risk | Vulnerability,85024118808,Extension of geopolitical supply risk methodology: Characterization model applied to conventional and electric vehicles,2017.0

Therefore, current study is aimed to determine an optimal closed loop supply chain network, which is composed of multiple producers, remanufacturers, intermediate centers and customer centers. Furthermore, uncertainty in the demand and uncertainty in the quantity of returned products is considered simultaneously in the network to make it significantly useful in the uncertain environment. A novel genetic artificial bee colony (GABC) algorithm is introduced with a new food source representation for the current problem. The proposed GABC algorithm considered neighbor food sources for local search and used crossover and mutation operations of genetic algorithm to enhance the exploration ability of the proposed algorithm. Taguchi method is employed to compute the optimal parameters of GABC for two different size test problems taken from literature and a Case problem which are modified according to the current research problem. The performance of presented GABC algorithm is tested by comparing the results of considered test problems with the results obtained from the original artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA). Moreover, to test the robustness of the proposed GABC algorithm, different scenarios of small and large size problems based on the quantity of demand and variations in demand are made to perform the experiments. Results indicate that proposed GABC outperforms standard ABC and GA in different scenarios to give smaller value of the total cost of network and gives more robust results to give smaller variations in the total cost of network due to uncertain variations in the demand, as compared to original ABC and GA.d",10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.06.079,Journal of Cleaner Production,Close loop supply chain network | Demand uncertainty | Genetic artificial bee colony algorithm | Remanufacturing,85024121360,Close loop supply chain network problem with uncertainty in demand and returned products: Genetic artificial bee colony algorithm approach,2017.0

This paper explores the challenges related to the End-Of-Life phase of products and circular systems of reuse and recycling within the commonly established frameworks of product lifecycles. Typically, Original Equipment Manufacturer-centric supply chain perspectives neglect the complexity at the End-Of-Life where many third-parties are involved in reuse and recycling activities. Based on a review of product lifecycle and related recycling literature, this study proposes the application of 'cascades', a term originally coined within the biomass domain. We propose and subsequently apply the 'cascade use methodology' and identify additional and value-adding End-Of-Life solutions for products and materials. The adoption of cascade utilization into product lifecycles is analyzed and critically discussed using case studies from independent remanufacturing and tire recycling, focusing on the End-Of-Life while excluding business models as renting or sharing. Although theoretically feasible, we argue that the practical adoption of 'cascade use' deserves more attention from researchers and practitioners in order to become an integral part of the comprehensive management of product lifecycles.",10.3390/su9091540,Sustainability (Switzerland),Cascade utilization | Closed-loop supply chains (CLSC) | Product life cycle | Product lifecycle management (PLM) | Recycling | Remanufacturing | reuse,85028599527,Cascade use and the management of product lifecycles,2017.0

In the growing and turbulent market of the current world both in national and in international relations, the need for reviewing and assessment of the resiliency of suppliers as one of the new concepts in supply chain management has been prioritized. In addition, globalization, increasing the regulations of governmental and non-governmental organizations, customers' request and pressure regarding environmental issues has led organizations to evaluate the measures necessary to implement green supply chain management, to improve their environmental and economic performance. The subject of selecting and evaluating suppliers on green supply chain with resilience capability first requires the identification of the supplier evaluation criteria so that it considers the resiliency of the supply chain concurrent with the concepts of green supply chain. Secondly, right tools should be used for the decision. Considering all the criteria and indicators in conditions of uncertainty encourages the development and application of methods, such as fuzzy theory and grey systems theory. In this research, a comprehensive model for evaluating green resilience supply chain network is provided.

The main goal of this work is to show the new approach to determining safety technological levels (SLs) in terms of water quality and its chemical stability, as well as issues of water corrosion properties in water distribution systems (WDSs), due to the fact that water supply pipes are prone to corrosion. In the paper the methodology of determining the risk associated with threat to technical infrastructure was considered. The concept was studied on the basis of real operational data from the water treatment plant. The probability of exceeding the individual parameters for WTPI is slightly larger than for WTPII, which means that this water treatment process may cause lack of chemical stability in the water supply network. Operators should anticipate in the process of designing water distribution system, using proper materials, as to ensure an adequate level of safety from the water source to the water recipient. It should be noted that it is necessary to adjust the material of internal installation of water supply networks to the parameters of the water. At present, there are no correlations between the designing step and water parameters.

497,"© 2017 Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation There is renewed interest in expanded agricultural development in northern Australia supported by increasing global demand for food, the region's proximity to Asian markets, and the current government policy initiatives to support economically sustainable and vibrant rural and regional communities. The production potential, financial returns, and the supply chain implications for irrigated agriculture were assessed in four different regions across northern Australia to provide a systems analysis of development opportunities and challenges. Gross margins for high volume, low value broadacre crops were mostly either negative or weakly positive, principally due to high transport costs to established markets in southern and eastern Australia. The returns were largely positive for higher value horticultural and specialist niche crops or industrial crops with local processing facilities. Scenarios incorporating alternative transport routes to Asia provided modest cost savings, but required assumptions for suitable shipping routes and cost-effective availability of containers, but did not significantly boost gross margins. When scaled to whole irrigation areas, the regional gross value of production could be significant but improving returns at farm scale requires more cost-effective supply chains. The ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investment was strongly influenced by the sequence of years associated with climatic variability and/or other unexpected shocks experienced in the years immediately following investment. The analysis highlighted that each component of the system – climate, soils, water, agronomic practice, pests and diseases, farm operations, management, planning, supply chains, infrastructure, labour, services, markets – needs to be understood but ultimate success will depend on managing the complexity of the whole farming system and value-chain. Further, scaling up development at a considered pace and being prepared for considerable lags before positive returns on investment are achieved will be critical for successful long-term irrigated agricultural ventures in northern Australia.",10.1016/j.agsy.2017.04.010,Agricultural Systems,,85019155776,Irrigated agricultural development in northern Australia: Value-chain challenges and opportunities,2017.0

Although climate change can induce large-scale impacts on industrial supply chain networks, first empirical studies suggest that adaptation to climate change is only slowly emerging as a management topic in firms. The present study examines why managers often do not engage their firms in adaptations to climate change. Thereby the study focuses, in particular, on the lack of strategic adaptation, which we define as anticipatory and target-oriented action with the purpose of increasing resilience to climate change. In order to investigate causes of lacking strategic adaptation in firms, the study employs a behavioral perspective based on the reasoned action approach. Thus, the study examines how barriers and motivational factors jointly shape the non-adaptive behavior of firm managers. Such causes of non-adaptive behavior are examined by comparing different classes of non-adaptors based on a case study in the manufacturing industry of the Austrian state of Tyrol. The obtained results underline recent criticism on barrier-centered analyses of non-adaptation by demonstrating the importance of motivational factors. Moreover, results point to the changeable nature of the identified causes of non-adaptive behavior by clarifying interactions between them and by suggesting influences from background factors.",10.3390/su9071132,Sustainability (Switzerland),Actor-centered approach | Barriers | Behavioral perspective | Climate change adaptation | Manufacturing industry | Motivational factors,85021656800,Non-adaptive behavior in the face of climate change: First insights from a behavioral perspective based on a case study among firm managers in alpine Austria,2017.0

Such recycling system has the benefits of reducing environmental pollution, boosting the economy by creating new jobs, and generating income from trading the recyclable materials. This leads to the formation of a global reverse supply chain (GRSC) of solid waste.

In recent years, the growing attention to environmental challenges has shown that these issues are becoming of more and more interest to both research and industry. Companies are expected to ensure their products are fully traceable and more sustainable, which requires the involvement of all of the actors in the production network. According to this aim, this study proposes a structured approach that uses the traditional traceability concept as a means to identify the main information needed to assess environmental impacts along the whole supply chain (SC). The proposed approach is composed of four main steps: (i) SC modelling to identify all stakeholders and their inter-relations, (ii) data sharing to collect all relevant data, (iii) data elaboration to calculate performance at different levels of detail and (iv) result interpretation to optimise the SC. The distributed implementation of the approach at different SC steps represents a useful means to practically realise a sustainable SC management.

The following study develops a systemic analytical framework based on which climate risks for manufacturing industries are reviewed and drivers (defined as supportive factors) of entrepreneurial robustness are examined. The analysis builds upon a case study in the alpine Austrian state of Tyrol where an intense regional rise of average temperatures occurs, going along with increased risks of natural mountain hazards and exposed settlement structures. In this climate-sensitive setting the authors conducted a survey on risk perceptions among 102 managers from manufacturing firms. Based on a comparison of the sectors metal and engineering, timber products, and construction, the authors argue that drivers of entrepreneurial robustness can be subsumed under five major strategic principles: (a) the deployment of slack resources, (b) vertical supply chain integration, (c) manufacturing flexibility, (d) material efficiency, and (e) technological risk prevention. Departing from the empirical results, the authors argue that across these principles the development of drivers depends on an interplay of structural prerequisites and human decisions on the levels of the focal firm, the supply chain network, and the political, economic, and geographic environment.

505,"© 2017 Elsevier Ltd Food supply chains (FSCs) over recent years have been epitomised by a range of concerns such as food and nutrition security, the distribution of value and a growing awareness of the threats posed by climate change. Taken together, these pressures have created a sense of urgency to re-examine the performance, equitability and sustainability of FSCs. This paper argues for the need to acknowledge and access the multiple, contested meanings that are attributed to FSCs. Taking its lead from post-normal science, the approach developed aims to understand the different contexts and account for the ‘multiple realities’ that exist. Key to this has been the development of a range of attributes of FSC performance that are common across narratives of sustainability and yet framed in various ways by different categories of actors, examined across a range of national contexts and within four spheres of influence. In so doing, this approach has the potential to more widely legitimise knowledge claims regarding FSC performance. This is critical if producers, policy-makers and consumers are to have the cognitive tools to enable them to make informed decisions about the broader impacts of the different FSCs they engage with.",10.1016/j.jrurstud.2017.03.008,Journal of Rural Studies,Attributes | Food supply chains | Multi-dimensional perspectives | Performance | Spheres | Sustainability assessment,85016041505,Acknowledging complexity in food supply chains when assessing their performance and sustainability,2017.0

Although Bangladesh is self-sufficient in rice, supply chain management lacks efficiency and results in artificial crisis and price volatility. This paper presents a system dynamics model of supply chain of rice starting from the farmers to the consumers to address supply chain management scenarios and design the policy options for efficient and sustainable supply chain management of rice in Bangladesh to ensure the availability of rice to the consumers in an economic manner under uncertainty. Towards these ends, the impacts of productivity changes of the seasonal production of rice, lead time and demand average variability on the supply chain performances are assessed and different management policies are analysed. Initially drying the rice and round the year operation of the milling industries stabilises not only the milling inventory but also the whole system. Also less total supply chain cost from economic operation results in less fuel consumption and hence less contribution to global warming. The model has the potential to identify and study the critical components of the overall supply chain, allowing for the creation of an efficient and sustainable supply chain network.",10.1080/23302674.2016.1179813,International Journal of Systems Science: Operations and Logistics,Bangladesh | economic order quantity | lead time | Modelling | reordering point | rice | supply chain | system dynamics,85056884744,Modelling of supply chain of rice in Bangladesh,2017.0
507,"© 2017, The Author(s). This paper outlines the development of an integrated interdisciplinary approach to agri-food research, designed to address the ‘grand challenge’ of global food security. Rather than meeting this challenge by working in separate domains or via single-disciplinary perspectives, we chart the development of a system-wide approach to the food supply chain. In this approach, social and environmental questions are simultaneously addressed. Firstly, we provide a holistic model of the agri-food system, which depicts the processes involved, the principal inputs and outputs, the actors and the external influences, emphasising the system’s interactions, feedbacks and complexities. Secondly, we show how this model necessitates a research programme that includes the study of land-use, crop production and protection, food processing, storage and distribution, retailing and consumption, nutrition and public health. Acknowledging the methodological and epistemological challenges involved in developing this approach, we propose two specific ways forward. Firstly, we propose a method for analysing and modelling agri-food systems in their totality, which enables the complexity to be reduced to essential components of the whole system to allow tractable quantitative analysis using LCA and related methods. This initial analysis allows for more detailed quantification of total system resource efficiency, environmental impact and waste. Secondly, we propose a method to analyse the ethical, legal and political tensions that characterise such systems via the use of deliberative fora. We conclude by proposing an agenda for agri-food research which combines these two approaches into a rational programme for identifying, testing and implementing the new agri-technologies and agri-food policies, advocating the critical application of nexus thinking to meet the global food security challenge.",10.1007/s12571-017-0648-4,Food Security,Agri-food research | Consumer practice | Crop production | Food justice | Food production | Food sales | Food security | Land use | Life cycle assessment | Nutrition | Public health | Resource management,85013131129,An agenda for integrated system-wide interdisciplinary agri-food research,2017.0

The establishment of an efficient reverse supply chain is important, especially in the electronics industry, considering the environmental and resource pressures worldwide. Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), an important environmental policy approach, has been adopted extensively in various countries, and the effectiveness of its implementation has been proven through practical application. However, the establishment and development of EPR are lacking in most developing countries where collection and recycling systems are underdeveloped. This study addresses this problem by exploring the hierarchical relationship among the driving factors of EPR in the electronics industry in China and by identifying and ranking the factors that are critical in EPR implementation. As important managerial conclusions, research results show that EPR-related laws and regulations, the consciousness of senior executives, and corporate image are the three most important driving factors of EPR implementation.",10.3390/su9040540,Sustainability (Switzerland),Analytic Network Process | Driving factors | Extended Producer Responsibility | Interpretative Structure Modelling,85017334824,Analysis of driving factors for Extended Producer Responsibility by using interpretative structure modelling (ISM) and analytic network process (ANP),2017.0
509,"© 2016 Elsevier Ltd Climate change and greenhouse gases emissions have caused countries to implement various carbon regulatory mechanisms in some industrial sectors around the globe to curb carbon emissions. One effective method to reduce industry environmental footprint is the use of a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). The decision concerning the design and planning of an optimal network of the CLSC plays a vital role in determining the total carbon footprint across the supply chain and also the total cost. In this context, this research proposes an optimization model for design and planning a multi-period, multi-product CLSC with carbon footprint consideration under two different uncertainties. The demand and returns uncertainties are considered by means of multiple scenarios and uncertainty of carbon emissions due to supply chain related activities are considered by means of bounded box set and solve using robust optimization approach. The model extends further to investigate the impact of different carbon policies such as including strict carbon cap, carbon tax, carbon cap-and-trade, and carbon offset on the supply chain strategic and operational decisions. The model captures trade-offs that exist among supply chain total cost and carbon emissions. Also, the proposed model optimizes both supply chain total cost and carbon emissions across the supply chain activities. The numerical results reveal some insightful observations with respect to CLSC strategic design decisions and carbon emissions under various carbon policies and at the end we highlighted some managerial insights.",10.1016/j.trd.2016.10.033,Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment,Carbon emission | Carbon policies | Closed-loop supply chain network design | Mathematical modelling | Robust optimization | Stochastic programming | Transportation mode selection,85009874268,Multi-period planning of closed-loop supply chain with carbon policies under uncertainty,2017.0

In addition, a hybrid model is proposed to identify the most sustainable supplier with respect to the determined attributes using an Iranian textile manufacturing company as case study. The first contribution of the research is developing a comprehensive list of sustainability criteria and sub-criteria and incorporating them into a questionnaire and distributing the questionnaire to academics and practitioners for establishing the importance and applicability of these criteria and sub-criteria. In order to demonstrate the robustness of the data obtained from the questionnaire, different established statistical tests (Cronbach's alpha and Mann-Withney U-Test) were applied. The results show that economic aspect is still the most essential aspect, followed by environmental aspect and finally social aspect. The second contribution is the development of a new hybrid model by integrating fuzzy preference programing, as one of the newest and most accurate fuzzy modification of Analytical Hierarchy Process, with Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution. Fuzzy Preference Programming overcomes the shortcomings of the previous methods for obtaining the weight and Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution prioritizes the suppliers and finds the best one under uncertainty. Generally, the developed list provides a basis that is helpful in improving suppliers’ performance in terms of sustainability which leads to improvement in sustainable supply chain management performance.

512,"© 2016 by Yale University Life cycle assessment (LCA) and urban metabolism (UM) are popular approaches for urban system environmental assessment. However, both approaches have challenges when used across spatial scales. LCA tends to decompose systemic information into micro-level functional units that mask complexity and purpose, whereas UM typically equates aggregated material and energy flows with impacts and is not ideal for revealing the mechanisms or alternatives available to reduce systemic environmental risks. This study explores the value of integrating UM with LCA, using vehicle transportation in the Phoenix metropolitan area as an illustrative case study. Where other studies have focused on the use of LCA providing upstream supply-chain impacts for UM, we assert that the broader value of the integrated approach is in (1) the ability to cross scales (from micro to macro) in environmental assessment and (2) establishing an analysis that captures function and complexity in urban systems.

Exploration and research of the mechanisms behind the failure of such systems have revealed that those capable of surviving are not robust, but resilient. This has spawned a stream of research on the resilience of different complex systems, from ecosystems, to the human body, to supply chains and communication networks. Supply networks are complex adaptive systems in which a subset of agents create flow and are required to deliver such flow to sink agents located at the other end of the network. Delivery of flow under pre-defined service conditions requires resilient design and operation protocols. In this article, a supply network formalism is introduced, and the concept and dimensions of resilience in supply networks, explored. Five core components of resilience are derived from reviewed definitions; two resilience dimensions, structure and control protocols, and two resilience levels, agent and network level, are characterized based on insights from articles in literature.

As food production systems and consumption patterns are among the leading drivers of impacts on the environment, it is important to assess and improve food-related supply chains as much as possible. Over the years, life cycle assessment has been used extensively to assess agricultural systems and food processing and manufacturing activities, and compare alternatives “from field to fork” and through to food waste management. Notwithstanding the efforts, several methodological aspects of life cycle assessment still need further improvement in order to ensure adequate and robust support for decision making in both business and policy development contexts. This paper discusses the challenges for life cycle assessment arising from the complexity of food systems, and recommends research priorities for both scientific development and improvements in practical implementation. In summary, the intrinsic variability of food production systems requires dedicated modelling approaches, including addressing issues related to: the distinction between technosphere and ecosphere; the most appropriate functional unit; the multi-functionality of biological systems; and the modelling of the emissions and how this links with life cycle impact assessment.

In today’s global markets, characterized by extremely fast changes in technology and customer’s demand, and by product life cycle getting shorter and shorter, a single firm has not the ability to be competitive if it is not included in a network that, operating as a single entity, is able to react to demand dynamism and volatility. Therefore, existing supply chains, structured in a global sourcing view, are highly vulnerable to perturbations resulting from a strong dependence on other network’s players, such as suppliers or logistics providers. In this complex and competitive context, properly assessing and managing risks connected to the different stages of the value chain, as well as external and not directly controllable risks, means being able to ensure continuity in supply. This paper focuses on the particular field of the fashion retail industry since its highly unpredictable demand and extremely short life cycle make it very important to analyse risks connected to the supply chain. The particular case we are referring to is represented by a fashion company that manages an extended network of wholesalers, direct operated stores, franchising mono-brand stores and factory outlet stores main aim of the presented work is to prioritise the list of identified risk factors by adopting the Analytic Network Process approach. This method is, in fact, more suitable for real complex problems that cannot be completely represented through a simple hierarchical structure.

Seaweed supply chains in Indonesia, especially carrageenan and agar products, are subject to risks arising both inside the participating companies and in their external networks. Uncertainties in yield, quality, price, and infrastructure in one part of the supply chain can affect the whole chain. To ensure a sustainable seaweed industry, an appropriate supply chain risk management (SCRM) is needed. There are four critical steps in SCRM: identifying seaweed supply chains, identifying and categorizing risks, assessing risks, and mitigating risks. To identify seaweed supply chains, we conducted field research, in-depth interviews, and literature studies. The field survey was conducted in the Provinces of South Sulawesi, West Java, East Java, Banten, and West Nusa Tenggara. The seaweed supply chains were modeled by the software Umberto to get a better understanding of material and energy flows between the key members. To identify and categorize the risks, we started with the risks mentioned in the existing literature works, and then applied the Delphi method to analyze the potential risk sources, their causes, and their impacts. To assess risks, we used a semiquantitative approach through the face-to-face interviews to generate a risk map showing the likelihood, and impact of adverse events. Afterward, the risk intensity was categorized based on the value of the responses and classified into five categories: negligible, marginal, critical, most critical, and catastrophic risks. The mitigation strategies considered sustainability (environment, economy, and social) and risks criteria.

In this way, the demand uncertainty is taken into account through the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) method which, in turn, relies on the datadriven approach. On the other hand, uncertainty set approach is employed to deal with the environmental uncertainties, i.e. CO2 emissions. Proposition of such a green supply chain network, based on the aforementioned uncertainties, makes the proposed model realistic, which is what completely missing in the literature. In order to proceed with this model, a robust counterpart of the developed uncertain problem should be formulated.

Purpose: Climate vulnerability assessments are often operationalized by the analysis of indicators defined by the spatial boundaries of the community under study. These, however, sometimes fail to capture interdependency among communities for basic resources. This paper aims to propose a framework for characterizing vulnerability caused by interdependency by adapting a supply chain lens. Design/methodology/approach: The paper proposes a definition for “indirect vulnerability” that recognizes the transboundary and teleconnected nature of vulnerability arising from resource networks among cities and communities. A conceptual framework using a supply chain approach is presented for climate hazards in particular. This approach is then demonstrated through a rapid appraisal of the rice, energy and water supply chains and the waste management chains of Metro Manila. Findings: The application of the supply chain lens to assessing the indirect vulnerability of Metro Manila brings to fore issues extending beyond the decision-making boundaries of local government units. Addressing these will require vertical government coordination and horizontal inter-sectoral collaboration. Thus, this supply chain-based indirect vulnerability assessment can be complementary to traditional vulnerability assessments in providing a larger systems perspective.

526,"© 2016 Elsevier B.V. Product recovery has become a viable option for many industries to realize economic gains while protecting the environment. However, insufficient investment and inefficient supply chains have hampered the viability of reuse and/or recycling because of the extended time intervals between the recycling process of recovery and reuse. Manufacturers and distributors face the challenge and necessity to reduce these process delays in order to recover the maximum value of the returned products through an effective, responsive closed loop supply chain (CLSC). This paper quantitatively measures the effective responsiveness of the CLSC model in terms of time and energy efficiency. The proposed multi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MOMILP) model evaluates delay parameters with decision variables that maximize profit, optimize customer surplus and minimize energy use. The model suggests decision makers may achieve an optimal tradeoff among differing objectives in a multiple-objective CLSC scenario. We employed a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) approach to solve the proposed MOMILP model and compared our approach with the Non-Dominated Sorted Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) for optimal solution. Results of the comparative evolutionary approaches shows that MOPSO outperforms NSGA-II in almost all cases in achieving the best trade-off solutions. Sensitivity analysis carried out to test the robustness of the model confirms that substantially less cost is feasible through the reduction of return process delays. This paper aims to formulate a multi-objective CLSC problem based on a network-flow model measuring the time value to recover maximum assets lost due to delay at different stages of the recycle process. We also developed a particle swarm approach for a multi-objective CLSC.

At present, there is limited environmental assessment of PSCs and consequently, a methodologically robust and environmentally expansive lifecycle supply chain assessment of two types of PSC modules A and B is also undertaken within the context of other PV technologies, to assess their potential for environmentally friendly innovation in the energy sector. Module A is based on MAPbX3 perovskite structure while module B is based on CsFAPbX3 with improved stability, reproducibility and high performance efficiency. The main outcomes, presented along with sensitivity analysis, show that PSCs offer more environmentally friendly and sustainable option, with the least energy payback period, as compared to other PV technologies. The review and analysis presented provide valuable insight and guidance in identifying pathways and windows of opportunity for future PV designs towards cleaner and sustainable energy production.",10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.095,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,Climate change | Environmental analysis | Lifecycle assessment | Perovskite solar cells | Photovoltaic technologies | Supply chain modelling | Sustainability metrics,85020420725,Perovskite solar cells: An integrated hybrid lifecycle assessment and review in comparison with other photovoltaic technologies,2017.0
528,"© 2016 Elsevier Ltd This paper shows a multi-objectives mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model for a petrochemical supply chain under uncertainty environments, namely disruption risks and less knowledge of parameters. In this model, two efficient queuing systems are applied in nylon plastic manufacturing and recycling centers, in which a Jackson network is also used. The aims are to minimize the average tardiness to deliver products, total cost and transportation cost. In addition the developed model specifies the optimal locations for a new distribution center (DC), collection center and disposal center as well as the optimal allocation of customer zones to each DC. This model is solved in three stages: (1) a Jackson network determines the queuing parameters, (2) an Lp-metric approach makes the multi-objectives into a single objective, and (3) an efficient Lagrangian relaxation based on a sub-gradient approach solves the presented model. Additionally, a real case study is shown in details to depict the application of the presented model. At the end, the sensitivity analyses are carried out to check the optimal objectives by changing the important parameters.",10.1016/j.compchemeng.2016.12.012,Computers and Chemical Engineering,Closed-loop petrochemical supply chain | Jackson network | Lagrangian relaxation | Queuing theory | Robust optimization | Uncertainty,85013404968,Designing a Reliable Multi-Objective Queuing Model of a Petrochemical Supply Chain Network under Uncertainty: A Case Study,2017.0
529,"© 2017 WIT Press Situational awareness of the operational status of specific, critical supply and demand nodes following a major disaster may inform response and recovery activities based on the ability of an infrastructure asset or system to support core facility operations. Near-real-time analysis of infrastructure dependency information is a computationally intensive process that has generally been observed informally by public safety officials. While system-level information may be desired, it has been beyond the capabilities of most local public safety and emergency management agencies. To address this problem, a Grassroots Infrastructure Dependency Model (GRID-M) was developed to enable near-real-time analysis of physical infrastructure dependencies of specific supply and demand nodes within four lifeline sectors: electricity, natural gas, water, and wastewater. The operational status of each node can be characterized as operational, partially operational, or not operational. These statuses are obtained by matching real-time outage or disruption data from utility providers with predetermined specific coping strategies based on a preincident limited infrastructure survey for specific assets within a network. This information can also be paired with a limited damage assessment to provide awareness of the accessibility to, and physical state of, each node within supply chains of interest. GRID-M displays all outputs within a Geographic Information Systems environment with additional prepopulated layers such as real-time traffic and demographic information of the affected communities. As such, GRID-M may be used following a major disaster to support the identification of priority response and recovery objectives based on the disruptions of critical local supply chains and their relationship with affected communities.",10.2495/SAFE-V7-N3-399-405,International Journal of Safety and Security Engineering,Critical infrastructure | Dependency | Disaster | Emergency management | Preparedness | Resilience | Supply chain,85053485307,Local supply chains: The disaster management perspective,2017.0

Purpose - For decades now, industrial manufacturers' complex product development (CPD) activities have seen various improvement approaches as well as product development (PD) support processes all in the quest to achieve shorter PD lead-times and higher return on investments. CPD process improvements, in terms of complex engineering design and delivery, still lack a lot more variance to be addressed on the ""better, faster and cheaper"" paradigm for efficient communication and information exchange flow processes. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents employing social network theory analysis and statistical Pearson (r) correlation analysis in a triangulation approach to a proposed optimum conceptual information technology systems' architecture and a ""best practice"" information flow process toward enhancing an industrial sustainable competitive advantage. Closed-end questionnaires were used to collect data for the scale or level of communication network from a sample size of eight Ship Power supply chain network complex engineering design and delivery systems-design teams with at least five members from each team. Findings - Two extremely interesting findings and observations were identified from the analysis carried out (isolates and close-harmonic analysis) as well as the findings from the hypotheses' testing. These essential analyses of the engineering systems-design teams were conducted by using the triangulation or mixedmethod described in the abstract methodology identified above. Originality/value - Effective and efficient real-time communication is seen as the vehicle for effective organization management. Although there may be some studies on effective technical communication in organizational and enterprise supply chain management settings, this research identifies a new robust and extensive analysis and feasible solutions to most of the communication bottlenecks and inefficient socioindustrial information flow processes, which need enhancement for industrial competitive advantage.

Design/methodology/approach - DEMATEL-based analytic network process (DANP) questionnaire survey with a theoretical SSCM model is applied to conduct an empirical test for the coal production and supply chain companies in Indonesia. Findings -The ""performance"" dimension out of the A-I-P of the SSCM is the most important one, while the ""adoption"" dimension is the least. Out of the 12 criteria under the three dimensions, the ""operational, economic, environmental, and social"" factors under the category of the performance dimension and the ""ISO 14001 certification"" criteria belonging to the dimension of ""implementation"" are the top five key factors in the SSCM. Research limitations/implications -There are some limitations in this study. First and foremost is the relatively small sample size with a limited geographic area, although they are unavoidable owing to one country case study. Practical implications -The test results are helpful to draw guidance for sustainable supply chain managers in implementing efficient SSCM in the wave of tough competition and changing marketplace.

535,"© 2016 Elsevier Ltd As major generators of environmental impacts, farms play a crucial role in enhancing the environmental sustainability of food-supply chains. However, appropriately assessing farm environmental performance poses a challenge; a plethora of different indicators have been used for this purpose, sometimes in the absence of conceptual considerations. This paper develops a broadly implementable framework for defining and measuring farm environmental performance which complies with the environmental sustainability concept viewed from an ecological perspective. After providing a critical review of existing indicators in the literature for measuring farm environmental performance and identifying their strengths and above all their weaknesses, it proceeds to develop ideas on how to implement the environmental sustainability concept at farm level. Starting at the macro level, these ideas are based on the central concept of ecosystem carrying capacity (constraints) referring to biophysical threshold thinking. The implementation of this concept at farm level results in the framework that we propose for measuring farm environmental performance. Environmental sustainability requires compliance with the carrying-capacity constraints imposed by the natural ecosystem within which a farm operates. Compliance with carrying capacity must occur at both local and global ecosystem levels, requiring a distinction between local and global farm environmental performance. The global environmental performance of a farm is defined as its relative contribution to compliance with the carrying capacity of the global ecosystem, and is measured by means of an indicator of environmental intensity over the entire production chain up to the farm gate. The local carrying-capacity constraint can be understood as the maximum environmental impact per unit of farmland area that can be sustained by the local ecosystem. Local environmental performance is therefore measured by means of an area-based indicator. Whereas all environmental issues must be considered at a global level, for some of them local level consideration is also required. Implementing separate local and global environmental performance indicators, as opposed to using only global or local indicators without distinguishing between them in conceptual terms, provides a more appropriate assessment of the environmental performance of farms, as well as a better basis for comparison between farms. Furthermore, it eliminates the risk of shifting environmental problems from the local to the global scale or vice-versa. The framework highlights the complexity of the environmental sustainability concept, which cannot be reduced to a single “one size fits all” indicator.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.07.022,Journal of Cleaner Production,Agriculture | Carrying capacity | Environmental sustainability | Farm environmental performance | Life cycle assessment (LCA),84994008622,Implementing farm-level environmental sustainability in environmental performance indicators: A combined global-local approach,2017.0
536,"Designing of storage facilities is an interdisciplinary process that requires consideration of technical, economic, social or environmental issues. Storage facilities, as a part of supply chain are designed to provide customers availability of goods at a certain time, quantity and place. This involves the functions resulting therefrom, such as storage, sorting, picking, packing, etc. The efficiency of processes in the supply chains is strongly influenced by the location and shape of the storage facilities that are critical components. These issues are multi-threaded, and they are subject of an iterative approach in which information tools are playing a special role. One of such tool is the SIMMAG3D system. It is a system for modelling and visualization in 3D of warehouse facilities, which was built based on developed mathematical models, computational algorithms and functional dependencies necessary for the designing of storage facilities. It also takes into account the different types of warehouses and design methodologies as well as the location of warehouses in the logistic network. The article presents the elements of the SIMMAG3D system and characterizes its functional capabilities.

Purpose: A case is made for developing “Relationally Integrated Value Networks for Total Facilities Management” (RIVANS-TFM) by synergistically connecting significant stakeholders of the project management (PM) and facilities management (FM) phases to deliver substantially better value for the end users of built infrastructure. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: A structured questionnaire survey enabled identification of typically significant stakeholders in the PM and FM phases. In total, 14 key stakeholders were identified through t-test analysis in this Sri Lankan study. Semi-structured interviews unveiled relationships among the aforementioned stakeholders and the findings were used to develop the “required” RIVANS-TFM, as well as the “existing” RIVANS-TFM, using the UCINET social network analysis software package. Social network theory of relationships was applied to analyze the networks in terms of “Structural Holes” or missing links and “Brokerage Potentials.” Findings: Structural holes analysis highlighted the existing setup to be more vulnerable to missing links than the “required”/targeted setup. Furthermore, brokerage potentials analysis revealed that owners, project managers, facility managers, maintenance engineers, main contractors, designers, principal consultants, and other specialist consultants can act as “brokers” to bridge the gaps or minimize structural holes, thereby uplifting and reinforcing the existing network to deliver better performance and value in TFM. Originality/value: By revealing existing and required levels of integration of each stakeholder in RIVANS-TFM, clients are provided a great opportunity to identify the stakeholders who should be engaged more, or less – in order to best achieve clients’ long-term aspirations and project objectives.

Recent progress in gasification techniques and key generation pathways for biofuels production, process design and integration and socio-environmental impacts of biofuel generation are discussed, with the goal of investigating gasification-to-biofuels’ credentials as a sustainable and eco-friendly technology. The synthesis of important biofuels such as bio-methanol, bio-ethanol and higher alcohols, bio-dimethyl ether, Fischer Tropsch fuels, bio-methane, bio-hydrogen and algae-based fuels is reviewed, together with recent technologies, catalysts and reactors. Significant thermodynamic studies for each biofuel are also examined. Syngas cleaning is demonstrated to be a critical issue for biofuel production, and innovative pathways such as those employed by Choren Industrietechnik, Germany, and BioMCN, the Netherlands, are shown to allow efficient methanol generation. The conversion of syngas to FT transportation fuels such as gasoline and diesel over Co or Fe catalysts is reviewed and demonstrated to be a promising option for the future of biofuels. Bio-methane has emerged as a lucrative alternative for conventional transportation fuel with all the advantages of natural gas including a dense distribution, trade and supply network. Routes to produce H2 are discussed, though critical issues such as storage, expensive production routes with low efficiencies remain.

This may require an organization to change the way it does business, designs product and manages supply chain. As these three areas are interdependent, bringing change in one area will influence the others, for instance, changing the business model from conventional sales to leasing will demand changes in both product design and the supply chain. At the same time, it is essential for an organization to anticipate the economic and environmental impact of all changes before it may decide to implement the circular product systems. However, there is no tool available today that can assess economic and environmental performance of circular product systems.

To explore in detail the relationships connecting materials to the products that require them, we map supply chains for five product platforms (a cadmium telluride solar cell, a germanium solar cell, a turbine blade, a lead acid battery, and a hard drive (HD) magnet) using a data ontology that specifies the supply chain actors (nodes) and linkages (e.g., material exchange and contractual relationships) among them. We then propose a set of network indicators (product complexity, producer diversity, supply chain length, and potential bottlenecks) to assess the situation for each platform in the overall supply chain networks. Among the results of interest are the following: (1) the turbine blade displays a high product complexity, defined by the material linkages to the platform; (2) the germanium solar cell is produced by only a few manufacturers globally and requires more physical transformation steps than do the other project platforms; (3) including production quantity and sourcing countries in the assessment shows that a large portion of nodes of the supply chain of the hard-drive magnet are located in potentially unreliable countries.

Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 gave companies over three years to determine and report on whether their products contained ""conflict minerals"" from the Democratic Republic of Congo area. Our analysis of every conflict minerals report submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission by over 1,300 corporations found that almost 80% admitted they were unable to determine the country of origin of such materials, and only 1% could certify themselves conflict-free with certainty beyond reasonable doubt. Internationally diversified firms and those with large and more dispersed supply chains were less likely to declare their products conflict-free: complexity reduces the visibility of a firm's supply chain.

Fisheries and aquaculture production, imports, exports and equitability of distribution determine the supply of aquatic food to people. Aquatic food security is achieved when a food supply is sufficient, safe, sustainable, shockproof and sound: sufficient, to meet needs and preferences of people; safe, to provide nutritional benefit while posing minimal health risks; sustainable, to provide food now and for future generations; shock-proof, to provide resilience to shocks in production systems and supply chains; and sound, to meet legal and ethical standards for welfare of animals, people and environment. Here, we present an integrated assessment of these elements of the aquatic food system in the United Kingdom, a system linked to dynamic global networks of producers, processors and markets. Our assessment addresses sufficiency of supply from aquaculture, fisheries and trade; safety of supply given biological, chemical and radiation hazards; social, economic and environmental sustainability of production systems and supply chains; system resilience to social, economic and environmental shocks; welfare of fish, people and environment; and the authenticity of food. Conventionally, these aspects of the food system are not assessed collectively, so information supporting our assessment is widely dispersed. Our assessment reveals trade-offs and challenges in the food system that are easily overlooked in sectoral analyses of fisheries, aquaculture, health, medicine, human and fish welfare, safety and environment.

548,"© 2016 American Chemical Society. The unbroken global refrigerated supply chain, or cold chain, is rapidly expanding in developing countries. In addition to increasing the energy intensity of the food system, the expanded cold chain may facilitate changes in the global diet, food waste patterns, food production and distribution, and shopping habits. The sustainability impacts of many of these changes chain are unknown, given the complexity of interacting social, economic, and technical factors. The current literature surrounding the environmental impacts of refrigeration in the food system focuses on the direct impacts of energy use and coolant emissions, and lacks a critical evaluation of the accompanying systemic societal changes that potentially carry greater environmental impacts. This review examines the cold chain as a transformative technology, identifying key intrinsic, indirect, and external factors that will favorably, unfavorably, or ambiguously impact the environmental profile of the food system. The review identifies key interactions and feedbacks between the cold chain, food production and consumption decisions, infrastructure development, and the global environment which are largely unexamined and in need of empirical data. Viewing cold chain expansion from this broader perspective is essential to understanding the changing impacts of the food system in developing countries and may inform future sustainability planning.",10.1021/acs.est.6b02740,Environmental Science and Technology,,85021857386,Critical research needed to examine the environmental impacts of expanded refrigeration on the food system,2016.0
549,"© 2016 Elsevier Ltd Biomass is a renewable resource that has attractive characteristics for energy production, but the corresponding supply chain could be subject of several uncertain factors that can affect drastically the optimal configuration, and those have not been properly accounted in previous publications. Therefore, this work presents a new approach for the optimal planning under uncertainty for a biomass conversion system involving simultaneously economic and environmental issues. The environmental impact was measured via the Eco-indicator99 method and the economic aspect was determined through the net annual profit. The proposed method considered the uncertainty involved in the raw material price by the stochastic generation of scenarios using the Latin Hypercube method followed by the implementation of the Monte-Carlo method, where a deterministic optimization problem was solved for each single scenario to select the structure of the more robust supply chain relying on statistical data. The proposed approach was applied to a case study for a distributed biorefinery system in Mexico. The results showed that the behavior of the profit values for the stochastic case is not associated to the behavior of the raw material price; also, it is possible to observe that the supply chain topology could be affected for the uncertainty in the raw material price; however, the environmental and economic objectives did not present significant changes.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.03.168,Journal of Cleaner Production,Biofuels | Biorefinery | Optimization | Supply chain | Uncertainty,84963944134,Stochastic design of biorefinery supply chains considering economic and environmental objectives,2016.0

This approach involves understanding both local resource availability and the demand-side implications of supplying global/regional markets as part of a more holistic SC design activity that incorporates local environmental factors. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed framework was derived from literature analysis, bridging relevant literature domains – natural capital theory, industrial ecology and SC configuration – in order to develop design rules for future resource-constrained industrial systems. In order to test the proposed framework, an exploratory case study, based on secondary data, was conducted. Findings: Research findings suggest that this approach might better identify relationships and vulnerabilities between natural resource availability and the viability of regional/global SCs. The research suggests that natural resource availability depends upon three elements – local resource consumption, global resource demand and external environmental factors. Research limitations/implications: The framework has two main limitations. The current work is focussed on a single industry case study used to exemplify the approach. Second, the framework does not consider other possible industries, which might enter or leave the specific location during the company’s operation. Furthermore, no assessment was made of the migration of populations within the area. Practical implications: For practitioners, such as those in the agri-food sector, the resource availability assessment framework informs SC configuration design. For policymakers, the research aims to provide policy guidelines, which can help to improve water-saving strategies for a particular region. At a broader societal level, the research raises awareness of resource scarcity amongst industrial players and the wider public. Originality/value: A resource availability assessment framework has been proposed, suggesting that the dynamics of both global and local resource demand, in conjunction with changing local environmental factors, can over time significantly deteriorate a firm’s natural resource impact on the local environment. Thus, the framework seeks to deliver mechanisms to evaluate potential vulnerabilities and solutions available to firms using a more proactive SC design method and to apply reconfiguration processes that account for natural resources, based primarily on network and resource attributes.",10.1108/JAMR-10-2015-0068,Journal of Advances in Management Research,Global supply chains | Local resource availability | Natural capital theory | Supply chain configuration,85044176374,Local water stress impacts on global supply chains: Network configuration and natural capital perspectives,2016.0

However, the supply chain of REE is subject to a complex set of technical, environmental, and geopolitical constraints. Some of these challenges may be circumvented if REE are recovered from naturally abundant alternative sources, such as saline waters and brines. Here, we synthesized and tested aminated silica gels, functionalized with REE-reactive ligands: diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic dianhydride (DTPADA), phosphonoacetic acid (PAA), and N,N-bisphosphono(methyl)glycine (BPG). A suite of characterization techniques and batch adsorption experiments were used to evaluate the properties of the functionalized silica adsorbents and test the REE-uptake chemistry of the adsorbents under environmentally relevant conditions. Results showed that BPG and DTPADA yielded the most REE-reactive adsorbents of those tested. Moreover, the DTPADA adsorbents demonstrated chemical and physical robustness as well as ease of regeneration. However, as in previous studies, amino-poly(carboxylic acid) adsorbents showed limited uptake at midrange pH and low-sorbate concentrations. This work highlighted the complexity of intermolecular interactions between even moderately sized reactive sites when developing high-capacity, high-selectivity adsorbents. Additional development is required to implement an REE recovery scheme using these materials; however, it is clear that BPG- and DTPADA-based adsorbents offer a highly reactive adsorbent warranting further study.",10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b01549,ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,Adsorbents | Ligands | Rare earth elements | Resource recovery | Saline solution,84994509487,Effects of ligand chemistry and geometry on rare earth element partitioning from saline solutions to functionalized adsorbents,2016.0

On the other hand, the supply chain manager drops sustainability objectives while coping with unexpected natural and man-made disruption risks. Hence, supply chain managers are now trying to develop sustainable supply chains that are simultaneously resilient enough to cope with disruption risks. Owing to the importance of the considered issue, this study proposed a network optimization model for a sustainable and resilient supply chain network by considering sustainability via embodied carbon footprints and carbon emissions and resilience by considering resilience index. In this paper, initially, a possibilistic fuzzy multi-objective sustainable and resilient supply chain network model is developed for the garment industry considering economic, sustainable, and resilience objectives. Secondly, a possibilistic fuzzy linguistic weight-based interactive solution method is proposed.

These tools must support the analysis with accurate results, but they must also be fast and easy enough to be used use in a complex practical setting. In this paper we present and discuss a deterministic single-period single-sourcing LP/MIP based method that the Linde Group has used for more than 100 projects for optimising the logistic network in the air-gas cylinder business. The model, called CSS (cylinder supply structure), includes a multi-echelon logistic network with transportation between plants and warehouses and distribution to several end-customers. The model allows deliveries to customers from all echelons in the supply network. Both the downstream flow of full cylinders and the upstream return of empty cylinders are included in the model. In general, more than 75 % of the total transportation- and distribution costs are caused by the final distribution to customers in a supply network as above. This paper will in particular analyse the distribution part of this model; how it is designed and how the cost is estimated. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the method we use empirical data to compare the model results with empirical results. The results showed that from the beginning the model overestimated the expected distances and costs for the distribution. With a rework and improved method to estimate the distribution cost, the model significantly improved its accuracy.",10.1007/s12351-015-0209-6,Operational Research,Distribution cost | Logistic network | MIP model | Supply chain network optimization,84944699132,"Estimating distribution costs in a supply chain network optimisation tool, a case study",2016.0

To overcome the difficulty of solving nonlinear programming, a piecewise linearization method was used to transform the nonlinear problem into a linear programming problem. Furthermore, the robust optimization model for supply chain network design under the uncertain disruption probability was formulated under both box and ellipsoid uncertain sets.

Existing literature on the subject of supplier selection is focused on evaluating primary (e.g., cost, quality, lead time) and green (e.g., CO2 emission, environmental practices) criteria. However, the concept of supplier resilience has recently emerged due to advent of competitive and global supply chains (and the operational and disruptive risks to which they are exposed). Several resilience-based supplier selection criteria are developed with respect to absorptive, adaptive, and restorative capacities. This paper further proposes a Bayesian network (BN), a paradigm that effectively models the causal relationships among variables but that has not been used in the context of supplier evaluation and selection, to quantify the appropriateness of suppliers across primary, green, and resilience criteria.

The cash flow and budgeting model will be coupled with supply chain network design using a mixed integer linear programming formulation. The article evaluates two financial criteria, that is, the change in equity and the profit as objective functions. The results indicate that objective functions are partially interdependent, that is, they conflict in certain parts. This fact illustrates the inadequacy of treating process operations and finances in isolated environments and pursuing objective myopic performance indicators such as profit or cost.

Since L. monocytogenes is inactivated by pasteurization, the majority of these cases have been linked to environmental and cross-contamination of fresh-soft, soft-ripened, and semi-soft cheeses. Cross-contamination of foods with L. monocytogenes is a continuous risk throughout the food supply chain and presents unique challenges for subsequent illness and outbreak investigations. Reports on outbreaks of listeriosis attributed to cross-contamination downstream from primary processing help highlight the critical role of epidemiological investigation coupled with coordinated molecular subtyping and surveillance in the recognition and investigation of complex foodborne outbreaks.

Finally, the actuator fault tolerant control problem due to the possible poor working environment is also studied. A series of two-mode-dependent controllers are proposed to stabilize such DNCSs and meet the robust closed-loop performance.

Over the last decades, the economic, social and environmental sustainability of the conventional agri-food system has and continues to be contested within both academic and public institutions. For small farms, the unsustainability of the food system is even more serious; farms' declining share of profit and the cost-price squeeze of commodity production has increased barriers to market access with the inevitable effect of agricultural abandonment. One way forward to respond to the existing conventional agri-food systems and to create a competitive or survival strategy for small family farms is the re-construction of regional and local agri-food systems, aligning with Kramer and Porter's concept of shared value strategy. Through a critical literature review, this paper presents ""regional and local food hubs"" as innovative organizational arrangements capable of bridging structural holes in the agri-food markets between small producers and the consumers-individuals and families as well as big buyers.

In this paper, a multi period, multi product, multi echelon and capacitated supply chain problem for short lifetime products was solved using both exact method and metaheuristic algorithms. The considered echelons in a forward/reverse supply chain network design include suppliers, hybrid production-inspection centers, hybrid warehouse-collection centers, retailers, disposal centers and recovery centers. To tackle both strategic and tactical nature of the problem and due to its complexity, the location problem is first solved using an exact method in which strategic decisions are made aiming to minimize the location costs. Then the allocation problem is solved using both exact and metaheuristic algorithms, namely Tabu Search and Differential Evolution, in which based on the results obtained from the location problem, the profit is maximized and tactical decisions are made. A cyclic feedback procedure is proposed in between the location and allocation models to obtain the best solution. The allocation model is linearized using a new method and to handle the uncertainty, a robust mixed integer programming model is developed which can retain the linearity of the model. The computational results confirm the effectiveness of the exact method for the location problem while testifies the proposed algorithms can obtain effective solutions compared with that of the exact solutions for the allocation problem in both deterministic and uncertain environment. In addition, the results show that in terms of preciseness and convergence, the proposed Differential Evolution algorithm outperforms the other algorithm.",10.1016/j.cie.2016.05.015,Computers and Industrial Engineering,Differential Evolution algorithm | Robust optimization | Short lifetime products | Supply chain management | Tabu Search algorithm,84969595249,An integrated approach to solve a robust forward/reverse supply chain for short lifetime products,2016.0

These practices require the introduction of environment-friendly equipment and facilities not only by shipowners, but also by other supply chain players who control critical complementary assets. In particular, these assets, whose nature is both specialized and cospecialized, are those where there is respectively unilateral or bilateral dependence between innovation and complementary assets. This study deals with the role of complementary know-how and assets in the development of green shipping practices by container shipping companies. The research is conducted utilizing a multiple case-study analysis based on leading container shipping companies involved in cooperative networks.

The approach is explorative with a cross sectional design that takes advantage of ten case studies out of selected logistics service providers (LSPs) operating primarily in the Scandinavian countries. The findings illustrate the major themes by analyzing current and future activities in developing environmentally sustainable logistical activities. In addition, four categories of challenges are identified: customer priorities, managerial complexity, network imbalance, and technological and legislative uncertainties. It is concluded that there is a great need for a holistic perspective where LSPs and product owners together analyze and design future logistical setups. The suggested holistic and integrative model, building on a three-dimensional concurrent engineering framework, provides new opportunities for research. Further research is needed to improve the interrelationship between LSPs and their customers in the development of sustainable logistical solutions.This paper puts forward recommendations for the sustainable development of logistics by combining the results from the case studies with a review of related literature.

The sheer magnitude of daily transactions makes it inevitable that there will be disruptions, further exacerbated by differences in cultural norms and attitudes that add a layer of complexity to managerial response. In this research, we examine the impact of national culture on individuals' responses to supply disruptions due to psychological contract breach. Using data from controlled experiments conducted with 158 subjects in China and 125 subjects in the U.S., we evaluate changes in decision-making behaviors and assessments of attitudinal outcomes regarding trust and repurchase intentions. Our results show post-breach behavioral differences based on national culture, but find that these differences are short-term in nature. Additionally, cultural differences show up in both of the attitudinal outcomes assessed in this research. Following a psychological contract breach, individuals from the U.S. express less trust in their supply chain partner and less willingness to work with that partner again in the future as compared to individuals from China. Our research suggests that managers and scholars interested in the cultural influences on the response to supply disruption will benefit from further research and understanding focusing on the intersection of psychological contract breach and cultural distance.",10.1111/jscm.12101,Journal of Supply Chain Management,behavioral supply management | buyer/supplier relationships | factor analysis | human judgment and decision making | laboratory study | regression analysis,84959422712,Supply Chain Psychological Contract Breach: An Experimental Study across National Cultures,2016.0

To date, a number of researchers have argued that intensive transportation activities through popular distribution strategies such as Just-In-Time (JIT) could significantly increase carbon emissions within logistics chains. However, a systematic understanding of how JIT distribution affects carbon emissions is still lacking in current literature. In this study, we develop a bi-objective optimization model for a carbon-capped JIT distribution of multiple products in a multi-period and multi-echelon distribution network. The aims are to jointly minimize total logistics cost and to minimize the maximum carbon quota allowed per period (carbon cap). The considered problem is investigated under three different carbon emission constraints namely periodic, cumulative and global. Since the studied problem is NP-Hard, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is developed and its parameters are tuned by Taguchi method. For further quality improvement of the developed solution approach, a novel local search approach called modified firefly algorithm incorporates NSGA-II. Different sizes of the problem are considered to compare the performances of the proposed hybrid NSGA-II and the classical one. Finally, the results are presented along with some policy and managerial insights. For policy makers, the findings show the impact of varying the carbon emission cap on total cost and total emissions under JIT distribution concept. From managerial perspectives, we analyze the relationships between average inventory holding and backlog level per period which can assist mangers to identify critical decisions for JIT distribution of products in carbon-capped environment.",10.1016/j.cie.2016.04.015,Computers and Industrial Engineering,Carbon emission constraint | Firefly algorithm | Green logistics | Just-In-Time distribution | NSGA-II | Taguchi method,84965178908,Carbon-capped Distribution Planning: A JIT Perspective,2016.0

As such, material limitations are seldom derived from a single or simple property and this resulting complexity makes business case decisions on new material development non-trivial. This is particularly true for ‘step change’ materials where a robust manufacturing supply chain/process route may not exist and the ability to utilise experience to bound validation and certification needs may be limited. This paper aims to highlight key issues associated with the limitations of existing materials and the nature of material selection to enable component weight reduction and /or temperature increase.

Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore contextual barriers to supplier development for sustainability (SDS) in global supply chains and managerial remedies to mitigate such barriers. Design/methodology/approach – A dyadic case study design was adopted with a Western European buyer and six of its Chinese suppliers. The database consists of 41 interviews and 81 documents. Findings – Contextual barriers to SDS in global supply chains derive from complexities in the sustainability concept, socio-economic differences, spatial and linguistic distance, as well as cultural differences between buyers and suppliers. Partial remedies include effective joint communications, an open organizational culture, and the fostering of cross-contextual understanding. Research limitations/implications – The findings contribute to theory development at the intersection of sustainable and global supply chain management research. They help to explain why scarce sustainability-related progress in global supply chains has occurred in recent years. Practical implications – The identified barriers facilitate managerial decision making that will expedite SDS progress in global contexts. Social implications – By diffusing knowledge regarding available remedies, the study contributes to improving SDS effectiveness, thereby fostering sustainability capabilities and performance of suppliers.

An intelligent contingency plan, rather than a direct and constant back-up plan, is more suitable for flexible and effective management. In this research, we introduce a unique contingent multi-sourcing decision protocol for effective response when disruptions occur. It is called the Intelligent Contingent Sourcing (ICS) protocol. Unlike previous research, which has mostly considered the constant multi-sourcing1 among internal suppliers, our model is developed for contingent multi-sourcing by collaboration with external suppliers. (When both the supplier and buyer are managed/controlled by the same company, that supplier is considered an internal supplier; in case each supplier is independent in terms of buyers and is self-interested, such supplier is considered an external supplier). Such contingent multi-sourcing requires the theoretical analysis of each participant's economic aspect, because each external supplier is independent and thus self-interested. The ICS protocol forms a contingent collaborative coalition based on a distributed decision making process. To evaluate the performance of the ICS protocol, three sourcing models are compared: (1) Single sourcing, (2) Constant multi-sourcing, and (3) Contingent multi-sourcing by the ICS protocol. Statistical analysis reveals that, with statistical significance, the ICS protocol performs at least equal to or better than single sourcing, in terms of less lost sales and less total costs; ICS protocol also outperforms constant multi-sourcing under specific conditions (stated in the article).",10.1016/j.eswa.2015.12.026,Expert Systems with Applications,Coalition | Collaboration | Distributed decision making | Sustainable supply networks,84955124831,Intelligent contingent multi-sourcing model for resilient supply networks,2016.0

A set of supply chains that are interdependent is called a holistic supply chain network (H-SCN) in this paper. There is a need to focus on building the resilience (in short, the ability of a system to recover from damage or disruption) of an entire H-SCN as it is believed that such a network system is strongly relevant to the recent economic recession that is triggered by financial crises. The objectives of this paper are to provide a classification of different SCNs in literature, leading to the identification of a new type of SCN system, i.e., an H-SCN, and to discuss the state of knowledge on the resilience of SCNs, particularly of an H-SCN.

584,"Our case study of Salers cheese production in south-central France highlights how place-specific knowledge grounds the various networks shaping the rise of geographical indications (GI) in food production. In 1961, Salers cheese producers created a ""Protected Designation of Origin"" (PDO). To preserve the distinctive character of their product, they opted to require use of the gerle, a traditional wooden vat, and an on-farm cheese making process. The gerle came recently under scrutiny from French governmental hygiene regulation enforcement, and the subsequent public controversy jeopardized the entire supply chain and destabilized Salers cheese-making methods. Prevailing in their efforts to protect Salers, producers established the gerle as mandatory and have since set up a governance board to ensure PDO brand integrity. Our analysis suggests that the diversity of technical choices and associated set of knowledge in Salers cheese production has paradoxically been both its strength and weakness. Local agricultural know-how forges links among participants in Salers networks, connecting cheese producers and consumers, to cattle, microbes, landscapes, wooden tools, and cheeses. Yet, diversity of local expertise creates a tension among producers who must collaborate to achieve unified standards within a PDO while resisting homogeneity. Such results contribute to discussing on PDO governance: an arena to share, compare, and unite local knowledge is critical for GI and thus for sustainable agricultural systems.",10.3989/chdj.2016.006,Culture and History Digital Journal,Cow cheese | Dairy farming systems | Geographical indication | Local knowledge | Salers | Supply chain,85008195313,"Salers protected designation of origin cheese, France.

The production of soy is one of the most important economic activities in the Brazilian Amazon, though the expansion of this industry has come at the cost of huge swaths of forest. Since 2006, the private firms that buy and trade soybeans globally have assumed a key role in ensuring that soy producers comply with forest protection policies, including the Soy Moratorium and public policies banning the use of illegally deforested land. We used evidence from field interviews and a GIS of property boundaries and soy-production areas to describe the private sector governance process and to characterize the variety of property arrangements underlying soy production in Mato Grosso, the leading soy-producing state in the Brazilian Amazon. These increasingly complex property arrangements include ownership of multiple properties by a single producer, use of rental properties owned by others, and soy and cattle production on a single property. This complexity could create loopholes allowing soy associated with deforestation to enter the supply chain. Comprehensive soy-governance strategies that include more robust procedures for verifying the provenance of soy across all properties, that account for the entire property rather than only the area planted to soy, and that use more transparent verification systems could achieve greater reductions in deforestation.",10.3390/land5020007,Land,Amazon | Brazil | Deforestation | Environmental governance | land holdings | Soy | Soy moratorium,85019232194,Property arrangements and soy governance in the brazilian state of mato grosso: Implications for deforestation-free production,2016.0

Stewardship is a popular term for the principles and actions aimed at improving sustainability and resilience of social-ecological systems at various scales and in different contexts. Participation in stewardship is voluntary, and is based on values of altruism and long-term benefits. At a global scale, 'earth stewardship' is viewed as a successor to earlier natural resource management systems. However, in South Africa, stewardship is narrowly applied to biodiversity conservation agreements on private land. Using a broader definition of stewardship, we identify all potentially related schemes that may contribute to sustainability and conservation outcomes. Stewardship schemes and actors are represented as a social network and placed in a simple typology based on objectives, mechanisms of action and operational scales. The predominant type was biodiversity stewardship programmes. The main actors were environmental non-governmental organisations participating in prominent bioregional landscape partnerships, together acting as important 'bridging organisations' within local stewardship networks. This bridging enables a high degree of collaboration between non-governmental and governmental bodies, especially provincial conservation agencies via mutual projects and conservation objectives. An unintended consequence may be that management accountability is relinquished or neglected by government because of inadequate implementation capacity. Other stewardship types, such as market-based and landscape initiatives, complemented primarily biodiversity ones, as part of national spatial conservation priorities. Not all schemes related to biodiversity, especially those involving common pool resources, markets and supply chains.

This paper presents a multi-period, multi-objective optimization model that enables robust production network and location planning during times of increased market uncertainty and risk exposure in environmental factors. The planning model focuses primarily on integrating the quantitative and qualitative risk factors associated with strategic production network planning. Integration was realized by linking a robust programming model with aspects of multi-target optimization using an EPSILON-constraint approach. This allows quantitative risks such as fluctuations in demand, exchange rates, and transportation costs to be factored into a common mixed-integer optimization model as discrete scenarios, with qualitative risks, e.g., security risks, accounted for as part of a points-based evaluation approach. The developed model minimizes the firm's expected downside risk exposure while meeting a pre-selected threshold level for environmental risks. The trade-off between risk and profit is depicted and interpreted using a Pareto analysis.

Hurricanes, tsunamis and floods are natural disasters, whereas man-made disasters may be strikes, terrorist attacks, etc. Failure at any point in the SC network has the potential to cause the entire network to fail. SCs must therefore be properly designed to survive well in the disruption scenario. The capability of successful survival (of the firm’s SC) against those adverse events/happenings is termed as resilience; and, the SC designed under resilience consideration is called a resilient SC. Effective supplier selection is considered as a key strategic consideration in SC management. It is felt that apart from considering traditional suppliers selection criterions, suppliers’ resiliency strategy must be incorporated while selecting a potential supplier which can provide best support to the firm even in the disaster/disruption scenario. The purpose of this paper is to focus aspects of evaluation and selection of resilience supplier by considering general as well as resiliency strategy, simultaneously. Design/methodology/approach – In this work, subjectivity associated with ill-defined (vague) evaluation information has been tackled through logical exploration of fuzzy numbers set theory. Application of VIKOR embedded with fuzzy mathematics has been utilized here. Sensitivity analysis has been performed to reflect the effect of decision-makers’ (DM) risk bearing attitude in selecting the best potential supplier in a resilient SC. A case empirical example has also been presented. Findings – The work attempts to focus on a decision-making procedural hierarchy towards effective supplier selection in a resilient SC. The work exhibits application potential of VIKOR method integrated with fuzzy set theory to select potential supplier based on general strategy as well as resiliency strategy. The final supplier selection score (obtained by considering general strategy) and that of obtained by analyzing resiliency strategy have been combined to get a final compromise solution. The decision-support framework thus reported here also considers DMs’ risk bearing attitude. Practical implications – The study bears significant impact to the industry managers who are trying to adapt resiliency strategy in their SC followed by potential supplier selection in the context of resilient SC.

However, DEA–ANN model has some drawbacks, which make some limitation in the evaluation process.

Appropriately applied to a specific context, landscape design can help people assess trade-offs when making choices about locations, types of feedstock, transport, refining and distribution of bioenergy products and services. The approach includes performance monitoring and reporting along the bioenergy supply chain. Examples of landscape design applied to bioenergy production systems are presented. Barriers to implementation of landscape design include high costs, the need to consider diverse land-management objectives from a wide array of stakeholders, up-front planning requirements, and the complexity and level of effort needed for successful stakeholder involvement. A landscape design process may be stymied by insufficient data or participation. An impetus for coordination is critical, and incentives may be required to engage landowners and the private sector. Hence devising and implementing landscape designs for more sustainable outcomes require clear communication of environmental, social, and economic opportunities and concerns.",10.1016/j.rser.2015.12.038,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,Adaptive management | Biofuel | Planning | Resource management | Scale | Stakeholder,84952360783,Incorporating bioenergy into sustainable landscape designs,2016.0

Without them, the offerings of an enormous variety of modern conveniences, including computers and mobile phones, would not be possible. The production of these everyday items depends on a secure, sustainable, and reliable supply of critical raw materials. In addition, product development also requires new hybrid materials when targeting lightweight structures, etc. However, the mandatory recyclability of new products or materials is not obligatory or even prevailing practice in present manufacturing business. Therefore, the main research question in this article is: “how to solve the challenge of recycling in industrial system?” In this article, a comprehensive approach to recycling based on the findings of research projects is presented. Simplified, this involves moving the challenge from the end of the product’s life cycle to the beginning, to the design or even to material development phases. Life cycle and system thinking and material know-how in the design phase are found to be essential elements of a new approach to recycling. This approach stems from the material development and market economy perspectives. Furthermore, the vulnerability of the industrial system to create uncertainty to recycling is also demonstrated.",10.1080/19397038.2015.1069416,International Journal of Sustainable Engineering,Decision-making | life cycle thinking in design and development processes | material efficiency | recycling | saving primary raw material | supply chain management,84940061708,Recycling – the importance of understanding the complexity of the issue,2016.0

Materials management in construction has become more complex as projects grow in size and complexity with potential disruptions caused by participants in the supply network. IT-based solutions have been employed by large businesses; however, they are not affordable to small-to-medium businesses (SMB). This paper proposes a cost-effective materials management and tracking system based on a cloud-computing service integrated with RFID for automated tracking with ubiquitous access. The current workflow of a SMB contractor was investigated and system requirements were analyzed in order to enhance it. As a low-cost solution to fulfill the requirements and improve supply chain visibility, the proposed system was developed on the cloud and integrated with RFID technology. A simulation study was conducted to show the potential impact of the system on performance of the SMB.

In this study, we propose an integrated framework based on interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and analytic network process to evaluate potential alternatives for sustainable supply chain management. The criteria used for evaluation are various enablers of sustainability, which are developed along economic, environmental, and social dimensions. ISM is employed to model the relationship among the various enablers. Sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the influences of dimensions, criteria, and alternatives scores on the stability of the ranking results. The results of our study demonstrate that governmental regulations, rewards and incentives, and listening to the views of the customers are the main enablers that can achieve sustainability in supply chains.

To develop industry-specific policies for mitigating environmental pressures, previous studies primarily focus on identifying sectors that directly generate large amounts of environmental pressures (a.k.a. production-based method) or indirectly drive large amounts of environmental pressures through supply chains (e.g., consumption-based method). In addition to those sectors as important environmental pressure producers or drivers, there exist sectors that are also important to environmental pressure mitigation as transmission centers. Economy-wide environmental pressure mitigation might be achieved by improving production efficiency of these key transmission sectors, that is, using less upstream inputs to produce unitary output. We develop a betweenness-based method to measure the importance of transmission sectors, borrowing the betweenness concept from network analysis. We quantify the betweenness of sectors by examining supply chain paths extracted from structural path analysis that pass through a particular sector. We take China as an example and find that those critical transmission sectors identified by betweenness-based method are not always identifiable by existing methods. This indicates that betweenness-based method can provide additional insights that cannot be obtained with existing methods on the roles individual sectors play in generating economy-wide environmental pressures. Betweenness-based method proposed here can therefore complement existing methods for guiding sector-level environmental pressure mitigation strategies.",10.1021/acs.est.5b04855,Environmental Science and Technology,,84957545021,Betweenness-Based Method to Identify Critical Transmission Sectors for Supply Chain Environmental Pressure Mitigation,2016.0

During the recent years, the closed-loop green supply chain management has been increasingly a center of attention as a result of governmental laws and legislations (regarding the environmental effects of any activity) and the soaring consumers' expectations. In this study, effort has been made to investigate a facility location/allocation model for a multi-product closed-loop green supply chain network consisting of manufacturing/remanufacturing and collection/inspection centers as well as disposal center and markets. To design the network, we have proposed a mixed-integer linear programming model capable of reducing the network total costs. The model has been so developed as to consider such environmental objectives as reducing the rate of carbon dioxide emission in the environment throughout the network in question. Moreover, the model has been developed using a robust fuzzy programming approach to investigate the effects of uncertainties of the variable costs, as well as the demand rate, on the network design. To solve the bi-objective programming model, use has been made of the ε-constraint approach and a numerical illustration of Copiers Industry is used to show the applicability of the proposed optimization model.

A two-stage mixed-integer programming model is used to develop a flexible sourcing strategy under disruptions. Our model integrates supplier selection and demand allocation with transportation channel selection and provides contingency plans to mitigate the negative impacts of disruptions and minimise total network costs. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the model and provide insights. The findings suggest that developing contingency plans using flexibility in suppliers production capacity is an effective strategy for firms to mitigate the severity of disruptions. We also show that flexibility and reliability of the suppliers and regions play a significant role in determining contingency plans for during disruption. Findings generally show that highly flexible suppliers receive less allocation, and their flexible capacity is reserved for disruptions. For firms that do not incorporate risk management into supplier selection and allocation, the recommendation is to source from fewer, more reliable suppliers with less risk of disruption. Our findings also emphasise that the type of disruption has important implications for supplier selection and demand allocation.

It then proposes two alternative packaging solutions. The analysis features different economic assessments and models with different environmental impacts, taking into account the characteristics of packaging solutions predominantly within two supply chain types: the traditional food supply chain and the short food supply chain. The economic and environmental models are applied to understand the limitations of existing packaging solutions, to develop two alternative solutions and finally to perform an overall analysis of all fresh food containers, allowing the definition of the most suitable container for each of the proposed supply chain scenarios, from both an economic and environmental perspective.

A diamond style supply chain, which is characterized by one parts supplier providing its parts to many companies and finally deliver to many assemblers, was identified in the manufacturing industry in Japan after the March 11 disaster in 2011, To prevent indirect loss from the supply chain disruption, Japanese companies are now collecting information of the supplier's supplier, so as to enable visualization of the physical flow of materials in the supply chain. In this research, we propose a method which we call the Supply Chain Visualization System (SCVS), which enables visualization of the supply network and validation of the usefulness of the method through roleplaying experiments using a simple three stages simple supply chain. Through the experiments, we found that the down stream companies in the supply chain are able to increase profits utilizing the SCVS as the result of proper decisionmaking regarding procurement. Interestingly, those companies that believed they do not have relationship with the disrupted company also reported an increase in profit. They benefited from the agile response of the final product assembler to the supply chain disruption, which assures continuous operation. Therefore, all suppliers except the disrupted supplier were able to continue production and maintain profitability. Furthermore, to mitigate supply chain disruption risks, three strategies, such as redundancy, robustness and flexibility, and two combinations of the three strategies were tested in three different business environments. We found that the strategy that enhances system redundancy (increased safety stock level) is not the best option under some system condition such as the conditions set in this research.

For the analysis of vulnerability to the occurrence of leaks in water supply network we used map algebra factors of age, network pressure and number of recurring maintenance. The highest vulnerability occurred in networks that had already suffered recurring maintenance, but as we launched to the map the geological accidents that were surveyed, these were associated with areas of high or medium vulnerabilities. Thus, it can be concluded that other factors analyzed (age and pressure) had greatest influence in the initiation of these events.

621,"Delivery of products and services relies on well-managed operations. In designing large-scaled supply chain and service systems, locations of key facilities are a critical decision, as these facilities form the backbone of operations of these systems. For example, a key to effective supply chain management is the deployment of a structurally well-designed facility network, consisting of plants, warehouses, retail stores, etc. The aim of the study of facility location is to develop analytical methodologies to inform the planning decisions for evaluating and selecting siting plans for these facilities that ensure both convenient provision of (or access to) products and services by customers and users, as well as efficient operations (i.e., low operating costs). Facility location and network design has long been an integral topic of study in operations management. In this literature, one may observe that earlier works mainly focused on a strategic view of accessibility and operational costs, using performance metrics based on strategic distances between the chosen facilities and customers or suppliers. This traditional approach often neglects the impacts of future tactical and operational activities to be conducted in the network, and optimizes objectives that do not fully reflect the long-term performance of the facility network. In attempt to rectify this shortcoming, researchers have proposed an integrated modeling approach that enhances the classical models by jointly considering strategic, tactical and operational activities in facility systems. By integrating tactical and operational characteristics of facility networks into strategic design decisions, the integrated approach offers a more balanced perspective on the strategic trade-offs in network design. As shown in a series of recent research, this integrated modeling approach can potentially deliver new insights into facility location problems in a variety of contexts, e.g., supply chain network design, deployment of health care facilities, and design of storage systems for renewable power. In this monograph, we perform a review of some important concepts in this emerging stream of literature. Motivated by supply chain design applications, we first discuss the basic modeling concepts, including both mathematical programming-based and analytical approaches for modeling. While simulation-optimization approaches can be used for analyzing location problems, they are not covered in the scope of this monograph. We also review techniques adopted in the literature to analyze and solve these classes of location models. This is aimed to serve as a reference for readers (especially students) who like to develop their own models but are less familiar with this line of research. Furthermore, we review a number of applications of this line of research, covering both applications in supply chain contexts and other emerging domains, such as sustainable transportation, energy and health care.",10.1561/0200000037,"Foundations and Trends in Technology, Information and Operations Management",,84992389442,Integrated modeling for location analysis,2016.0

Few consider medium- to long-term restoration strategies to reconnect urban areas to national supply chain interdependent critical infrastructure systems (SCICI). These SCICI promote the effective flow of goods, services, and information vital to the economic vitality of an urban environment. To re-establish the connectivity that has been broken during a disaster between the different SCICI, relationships between these systems must be identified, formulated, and added to a common framework to form a system-level restoration plan. To accomplish this goal, a considerable collection of SCICI data is necessary. The aim of this paper is to review what data are required for model construction, the accessibility of these data, and their integration with each other. While a review of publically available data reveals a dearth of real-time data to assist modeling long-term recovery following an extreme event, a significant amount of static data does exist and these data can be used to model the complex interdependencies needed. For the sake of illustration, a particular SCICI (transportation) is used to highlight the challenges of determining the interdependencies and creating models capable of describing the complexity of an urban environment with the data publically available. Integration of such data as is derived from public domain sources is readily achieved in a geospatial environment, after all geospatial infrastructure data are the most abundant data source and while significant quantities of data can be acquired through public sources, a significant effort is still required to gather, develop, and integrate these data from multiple sources to build a complete model. Therefore, while continued availability of high quality, public information is essential for modeling efforts in academic as well as government communities, a more streamlined approach to a real-time acquisition and integration of these data is essential.",10.5334/dsj-2016-001,Data Science Journal,Critical Infrastructure | Extreme Events | GIS | Logistics Network | Urban Supply Chain,84975824100,Post-disaster supply chain interdependent critical infrastructure system restoration: A review of data necessary and available for modeling,2016.0

Customs clearance to cross borders is critical to enhancing the competitiveness of both importers and exporters. As such, each country has adopted an authorized economic operator (AEO) program to promote the security of both imported and exported cargo as well as expedite freight movements. The purpose of this paper is to discover the factors which should be taken into account to utilize an AEO program, and to look at the causal relations between these factors.

Moreover, this study performed bootstrap re-sampling to verify all paths and significance. Findings: It was found that AEO external pressure, training capacity, and sustainability are shown to have a significant impact on AEO performance. Furthermore, for the group with a high level of AEO application, training capacity and AEO sustainability are shown to have a greater effect on AEO performance. For the group with a low level of AEO application, internal regulation is shown to have a bigger impact on AEO performance.

630,"© 2016 Jordan et al. Diversification of agroecological systems to enhance agrobiodiversity is likely to be critical to advancing environmental, economic, and social sustainability of agriculture. Temperate-zone agroecological systems that are currently organized for production of summer-annual crops can be diversified by integration of fallow-season and perennial crops. Integration of such crops can improve sustainability of these agroecological systems, with minimal interference with current agricultural production. Importantly, these crops can provide feedstocks for a wide range of new bio-products that are forming a new agricultural bioeconomy, potentially providing greatly increased economic incentives for diversification. However, while there are many fallow-season and perennial crops that might be used in such a ""bioeconomic"" strategy for diversification, most are not yet well adapted and highly-marketable. Efforts are underway to enhance adaptation and marketability of many such crops. Critically, these efforts require a strategic approach that addresses the inherent complexity of these projects. We outline a suitable approach, which we term ""sustainable commercialization"": a coordinated innovation process that integrates a new crop into the agriculture of a region, while intentionally addressing economic, environmental and social sustainability challenges via multi-stakeholder governance. This approach centers on a concerted effort to coordinate and govern innovation in three critical areas: germplasm development, multifunctional agroecosystem design and management, and development of end uses, supply chains, and markets. To exemplify the approach, we describe an ongoing effort to commercialize a new fallow-season crop, field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.).",10.12952/journal.elementa.000081,Elementa,,84986292334,Sustainable commercialization of new crops for the agricultural bioeconomy,2016.0

External Quality Assessment (EQA) surveys performed by the World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa (WHO AFRO) revealed the need for the strengthening of public health microbiology laboratories, particularly for testing of epidemic-prone diseases in the African Region. These surveys revealed common issues such as supply chain management, skilled personnel, logistical support and overall lack of quality standards. For sustainable improvements to health systems as well as global health security, deficiencies identified need to be actively corrected through robust quality assurance programmes and implementation of laboratory quality management systems. Given all the pathogens of public health importance, an external quality assessment programme with a focus on vaccine-preventable diseases and emerging and re-emerging dangerous pathogens is important, and should not be stand-alone, but integrated within laboratory networks as seen in polio, measles, yellow fever and rubella. In 2015, WHO AFRO collaborated with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and partners in a series of consultations with countries and national and regional EQA providers for the development of quality assurance models to support HIV point-of-care testing and monitoring. These consultations revealed similar challenges as seen in the WHO AFRO surveys. WHO AFRO brought forth its experience in implementing quality standards for health programmes, and also opened discussions on how lessons learned through such established programmes can be utilised to supporting and strengthening the introduction of early infant diagnosis of HIV and viral load point-of-care testing.

China’s fiscal and taxation law reform is at a critical stage since Chinese economy development needs to consider compromising interests and conflicts from all sources, such as the social benefit network, real estate industry avidity, internationalizing currencies, fostering a philanthropic culture, and growing as a leader in the world market. These undertakings all demand a modern, handy fiscal and taxation law system. On the other hand, after two decades of implementation of the 1994 tax sharing system, the original initiative of strengthening centralized control might not keep pace with the needs of balancing decentralization and local financing demands, in addition to the troublesome taxpayers’ protection, tax judicature reform, and worsening environmental irregularities. Admittedly, China’s fiscal and taxation law reform faces new challenges and incentives. Rigorous international tax frameworks and multi-jurisdictional cooperation drive China to respond as an international trade giant and a responsible game player. Such international tax policy orientations create another layer of incentives and necessity for China to fine-tune its domestic fiscal and taxation legal framework, ranging from promotion of free trade zones, global sourcing practice and supply chain management, renegotiation of outdated tax treaty articles, more active participation in consequential overseas investments, to WTO Protocol compliance review, and international tax dispute resolution.

633,"© 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to focus on adoption of certified management standards, specifically public standards. Such standards play an increasingly important role in today’s business environment. However, to generate adoption benefits, they must be first widely accepted – a situation where they have become viewed as the de facto norms. For this state to occur early adopters play a critical role. Past research has argued that early adopters, in exchange for assuming more risk, are rewarded with higher economic returns. Yet, these findings are based on private, not public standards. With public standards, early adopters do not receive such benefits. There is evidence that public standards are becoming more important. This situation leads to a simple but important question addressed in this study – if early adopters assume the risks of embracing a new public standard without economic benefits, then what is their motivation? To resolve this question, this study draws on agency theory and prospect theory. The authors argue that early adopters embrace such standards because of their desire to minimize risk resulting from failure to support the goal at the heart of the public standards. Design/methodology/approach: Data were obtained from the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) Partners Cost Benefit Survey and analyzed through structural equation modeling. Findings: Early adopters of public standards are not driven by economic benefits but rather by the need to minimize their exposure to the risks associated with failing to satisfy the goals associated with a public standard. In other words, they were motivated by the need to minimize costs. In the case of C-TPAT, these costs are those of failing to provide or improve network security. Research limitations/implications: This study has shed new light on the standards adoption process by clarifying the specific motivations that drive early adoption of a public standard. In addition to identifying the loss aversion motives of early adopters and economic benefit motives of later adopters, the authors have also elaborated on the notion that standards have differing levels of precedence, particularly when comparing private with public standards. Practical implications: In a world characterized by increasing demands for outcomes such as improved security and where governmental funding is falling, due to growing deficits and governments that are becoming more conservative, the authors expect the use of public standards to increase. Originality/value: Different from prior research on private standard, the paper focuses on the organizations involved in the adoption and diffusion of a public standard, with special attention being devoted to the early adopters.

Supply network resilience is an emerging concept related to the ability of a network to tolerate disruptions; current understanding of its meaning and dimensions, its role in the design and operation of supply networks, and its relation to sustainability is at its early stages. Existing approaches are based on the trade-off between increased resources and higher fault-tolerance. The Fault Tolerance by Teaming (FTT) principle of Collaborative Control Theory has been applied in sensor networks effectively and appears as a promising original approach not based on the aforementioned trade-off and capable of producing networks with higher resilience. Inspired by the FTT principle, a Resilience by Teaming Framework (RBT) for supply networks is developed to address the design and operation of resilient supply networks. RBT is tested and validated through the application of its protocols to case studies in production and distribution networks.

It is motivated by the increasing attention that the design of adaptive supply chains has been receiving in recent years, as it is considered one of the most important critical factors in gaining sustainable competitive advantage in the current hypercompetitive environment. Focusing on two learning processes (i.e., by imitation and by interacting), diverse types of adaptive supply chains recognizable within industrial districts are compared by means of an agent-based simulation on the basis of their adaptive performance in environments characterized by different level of complexity and turbulence. The results confirm that the supply chain type influences the relationship between learning and adaptation and that both the product complexity and the turbulence of the environment moderate this effect.

Pallets are currently the most widespread system for internal material handling and logistics of goods through a supply chain: they represent a critical asset for all firms, especially for Logistics Service Providers (LSPs). Analyzing pallet management systems according to a logistics point of view is quite a new research trend. Open or closed loop networks are now applied worldwide for pallet logistics: the latter is more complex to design and manage due to the presence of a reverse logistics process; several inbound and outbound processes have to be assessed. On the other hand, closed loop systems are the most effective, both from an environmental and an economic point of views. The aim of the paper is to outline critical factors (such as the pallet logistics network, the interchange system) in designing closed loop pallet management systems; a simulation-based tool has been developed in order to support logistic managers in designing effective organizational scenarios for these systems. Cost and time based KPIs will be estimated by the simulation model. A case study about a LSP firm has been also analyzed in order to validate the proposed model.

Environmental and social impacts associated with the geographic concentration and specialization in production, processing, and distribution that accompanied industrialization of the US food system have degraded our nation’s capacity to adapt to changing climate conditions. A consensus is emerging in sustainable food system scholarship that two fundamental changes—a transformation of production methods from industrial to sustainable and a transformation of food system geography from regional specialization to regional diversity—should enhance the resilience of the food system to climate change. A review of the literature suggests that transition to a nationally integrated network of sustainable metropolitan food systems (“metropolitan foodsheds”) would improve climate resilience by enhancing three key qualities associated with resilience in social-ecological systems—diversity, modularity, and balanced accumulation of capital assets. These qualities promote the capacity of a system to respond, to recover, and to transform in ways that reduce damaging effects and take advantage of opportunities created by change. Using a set of behavior-based resilience indicators in a review of case study research, this article examines the general resilience of sustainable production and supply chain systems. Sustainable production systems managed by award-winning sustainable food producers expressed all of the behaviors of a resilient system and demonstrated remarkable resilience to weather variability and extremes. These producers attributed the climate resilience of their farms and ranches to high-quality soils, planned biodiversity, and diversified marketing. Like many sustainable producers, these farmers and ranchers not only produce crops and livestock, they also participate in processing, distribution, and retailing. Resilient behavior was also expressed in sustainable supply chains developed by networked community cooperatives and through government investment in a large nonprofit food terminal. As recent food system planning projects in the USA illustrate, there is growing recognition of the potential sustainability and resilience benefits of regional food systems designed to develop positive relationships between the metropolitan core and surrounding areas. We can begin now to shift public support for a transition to more diversified production, to develop regional food system infrastructure, and to conduct comprehensive research to refine resilience indicators and develop food system performance metrics to guide a transformation of the US food system to a more sustainable and resilient future.",10.1007/s13412-015-0349-2,Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences,Agriculture | City region | Climate change | Food system | Megaregions | Metropolitan foodshed | Resilience | Sustainability,84977118133,Metropolitan foodsheds: a resilient response to the climate change challenge?,2015.0
639,"© 2015, AESS. This article explores problems and solutions in the New England groundfish fishery, where social, economic, environmental, and food system sustainability are major challenges. With industrialization of fishing during the past century, managers have turned a blind eye to issues of scale (e.g., industrial scale vs. community scale), which has led to chronic overfishing. There have been recurring stock collapses of favored species (e.g., cod) during the past 50 years despite federal government management of the fishery during most of that period. Small- and medium-scale fishermen—with better local knowledge, motivation for local sustainability, and smaller ecological footprints—have increasingly been displaced by large-scale operations, especially during recent years with policies that are privatizing fisheries access and consolidating the fleet. Coastal fishing communities and the fishery have suffered. The Fish Locally Collaborative (FLC)—an international decentralized network of fishermen and their allies—is promoting a paradigm shift. Its efforts to keep the smaller-scale boats afloat and support local communities include economic and political strategies. Defining value with quadruple bottom line accounting (i.e., assessing social, economic, environmental, and food system impacts), the FLC promotes a shift from high-volume/low-value production to low volume/high value. The FLC has reestablished local food supply chains with community-supported fisheries, public seafood markets, and “boat-to-hospital” and “boat-to-school” programs based on procurement contracts that specify local and sustainable catch. FLC participants promote the consumption of lesser-known fish species to motivate more balanced and ecologically sustainable fishing. Politically, FLC participants continue to build the strength of the network and engage in policy discussions at local, national, and international levels.",10.1007/s13412-015-0343-8,Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences,Catch shares | Cod | Community-supported fisheries | Fish Locally Collaborative | Fisheries | New England | Regional fisheries council | Resilience | Sutainability,84977151226,Promoting resilience in a regional seafood system: New England and the Fish Locally Collaborative,2015.0
640,"© 2015 Elsevier B.V. Assessing water supply sustainability is crucial to meet stakeholders' needs, notably in the Mediterranean. This region has been identified as a climate change hot spot, and as a region where water demand is continuously increasing due to population growth and the expansion of irrigated areas. The Hérault River catchment (2500km2, France) is a typical example and a negative trend in discharge has been observed since the 1960s. In this context, local stakeholders need to evaluate possible future changes in water allocation capacity in the catchment, using climate change, dam management and water use scenarios. A modelling framework that was already calibrated and validated on this catchment over the last 50years was used to assess whether water resources could meet water demands at the 2030 horizon for the domestic, agricultural and environmental sectors. Water supply sustainability was evaluated at the sub-basin scale according to priority allocations using a water supply capacity index, frequency of unsatisfactory years as well as the reliability, resilience and sustainability metrics. Water use projections were based on the evolution of population, per-unit water demand, irrigated areas, water supply network efficiency, as well as on the evaluation of a biological flow. Climate projections were based on an increase in temperature up to 2°C and a decrease in daily precipitation by 20%. Adaptation strategies considered reducing per-unit water demand for the domestic sector and the importation of water volume for the agricultural sector. The dissociated effects of water use and climatic constraints on water supply sustainability were evaluated. Results showed that the downstream portions would be the more impacted as they are the most exploited ones. In the domestic sector, sustainability indicators would be more degraded by climate change scenarios than water use constraints. In the agricultural sector the negative impact of water use scenarios would be stronger. The environmental sector would be hardly satisfied especially in summer with low resilience levels.

641,"© 2015, AESS. This paper lays out the relationships between three mutually reinforcing concepts associated with agroecosystems: (1) agroecosystem health, the extent to which an agroecosystem can meet human needs for all of its residents over time; (2) resilience, the capacity of a system to adapt, reorganize, and maintain key functions in the face of turbulent and unpredictable change in its environment; (3) food security, sufficient quantity and quality of food for everyone at all times. Agroecosystem health has been defined by a number of properties including the following: stability, sustainability, equitability, productivity, and autonomy, each in the context of specific spatial and temporal scales. Indicators that characterize biophysical and social conditions including soil health, biodiversity, topography, farm economics, land economics, and social organization can be combined using analytical hierarchy process to map agroecosystem health across a landscape. The resulting map may provide incentive and guidance for improving the conditions underlying agroecosystem health. Resilience and agroecosystem health overlap largely because both rely on diversity, in biological and physical as well as human cultural, social, and economic terms. The Agroecosystems Management Program at The Ohio State University has approached research and outreach to improve agroecosystem health, resilience, and food security by encouraging self-organizing social networks for economic development around local and regional agricultural supply chains, encouraging farm enterprise diversity at a wider range of farming scales, and conducting research to monitor and estimate the benefits of such diversification. Social media tools have been explored for connecting entrepreneurs at the planning stage, with the ultimate goal of improving the economic support for more diversified enterprises in agroecosystems. Although challenging, such adaptive management experiments may create and encourage new opportunities for managing agroecosystem health, and with it, resilient food production and security.",10.1007/s13412-015-0322-0,Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences,Biodiversity | Crop diversity | Enterprise diversity | Entrepreneurship | Self-organization | Sustainable agriculture,84977139243,"Agroecosystem health, agroecosystem resilience, and food security",2015.0

In low-income countries, resources to assist the injured in a timely fashion may be limited. As a consequence, necrosis and wound infection in disaster patients is common and frequently leads to adverse health outcomes such as amputations, chronic wounds, and loss of life. In such compromised health care environments, low-tech and cheap wound care options are required that are in ready supply, easy to use, and have multiple therapeutic benefits. Maggot debridement therapy (MDT) is one such wound care option and may prove to be an invaluable tool in the treatment of wounds post-disaster. Discussion This report provides an overview of the wound burden experienced in various types of disaster, followed by a discussion of current treatment approaches, and the role MDT may play in the treatment of complex wounds in challenging health care conditions. Maggot debridement therapy removes necrotic and devitalized tissue, controls wound infection, and stimulates wound healing. These properties suggest that medicinal maggots could assist health care professionals in the debridement of disaster wounds, to control or prevent infection, and to prepare the wound bed for reconstructive surgery. Maggot debridement therapy-assisted wound care would be led by health care workers rather than physicians, which would allow the latter to focus on reconstructive and other surgical interventions. Moreover, MDT could provide a larger window for time-critical interventions, such as fasciotomies to treat compartment syndrome and amputations in case of life-threatening wound infection. Recommendations There are social, medical, and logistic hurdles to overcome before MDT can become widely available in disaster medical aid. Thus, research is needed to further demonstrate the utility of MDT in Disaster Medicine. There is also a need for reliable MDT logistics and supply chain networks. Integration with other disaster management activities will also be essential. Conclusions In the aftermath of disasters, MDT could play an important role facilitating timely and efficient medical treatment and improving patient outcomes. Existing social, medical, and logistic barriers will need to be overcome for MDT to be mainstreamed in Disaster Medicine.

Clear understanding of these risks can help supply chain managers to make effective decisions. This paper identifies main risks related to crude oil supply chain and implements decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method to determine the interdependency between risks and then applies analytic network process (ANP) method to evaluate the importance of each risk and to determine the best response strategy. The results show that the most important risk area is the regulatory and environmental risks and that the transference and cooperation policy is rated as the best response strategy.

Large commercial corporations have also shown responsibility for preserving planet and people while maintaining profit. Our present paper is motivated by the three P’s—people, planet, and profit. In our paper, we have attempted to develop a responsive sustainable supply chain network which can respond to a certain degree of uncertainty due to uncontrollable forces. We have developed a model using robust optimization based on three well-known robust counterpart optimization formulations. Finally, this paper compares the results of the three formulations using different test scenarios and parameter-sensitive analysis in terms of final output, CPU time, the level of conservatism, the degree of closeness to the ideal solution, the degree of balance involved in developing a compromise solution, and satisfaction degree. Two further questions related to environmental dimensions and social dimensions have been investigated using an appreciative inquiry, a quasi-ethnographic study. In this way, we have embraced mixed research design to address our research questions.

In 2010/2011, serious flooding in Queensland left towns isolated, major roads and highways cut and incurred significant loss of life and property. In terms of food security, large areas of agricultural land were inundated, and food supply chains, including both long and short chains, were affected in significant ways. The impacts included increases in food prices; deterioration in food quality; reduced consumer access to food; and disruption to the sourcing, transportation and distribution of food, grocery and other items. Examining the discourses and policies surrounding food supply during and after the floods, this paper asks, what lessons for building a more resilient food system have emerged from the 2011 floods? To explore this question, we consider policy documents, media reports, interviews and fieldwork with key stakeholders. We find evidence of strong collaboration of state government and long supply chain operators, but to the general exclusion of civil society-based food chains. Long chains provide the vast bulk of food to Queensland consumers but are vulnerable when roads are cut; civic agriculture showed resilience but remained marginal to the food needs of most Queensland consumers. Both resilience and vulnerability were present within both long and short food supply chains. Yet, there is limited evidence that food security issues, beyond productivity enhancement, are being considered in discussions and policies for climate change and natural disasters. We suggest that a broader view of climate change, beyond disasters and food production, has yet to be fully integrated into food security policy—and supply chain governance and practice—in Australia.",10.1007/s13412-015-0278-0,Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences,Alternative food networks | Disasters | Food supply chains | Governance | Resilience | Supermarkets,84977103744,"Connecting resilience, food security and climate change: lessons from flooding in Queensland, Australia",2015.0

The climate change vulnerability of a food system is a function of the exposure of the system to specific climate effects, the sensitivity of the system to those effects, and the capacity of the system adapt to those effects in order to maintain system integrity. A synthesis of recent literature conducted to explore the vulnerability of the US food system to climate change suggests that the interaction between regional climate change effects and the geographic specialization and concentration of agricultural production in the USA increases the vulnerability of the US food system to climate change. Vegetable and fruit production in the Pacific states are particularly sensitive to reduced water supplies, warmer winters, and more variable spring weather. Grain production in the Great Plains and the Midwest is sensitive to more variable weather, warmer winters, heat wave, and hot summer nights and flooding caused by more frequent heavy rains. The concentration of beef, pork, and poultry production in confined animal feeding operations located in the southern Great Plains and the Southeast is particularly sensitive to increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather and interruptions in feed, water, and power supplies associated with interactions between land, water, and energy use that amplify climate change effects. There is evidence that climate change is already causing disruptions throughout the US food system. Farmers and ranchers in the US report that increased weather variability and more frequent and intense weather extremes have increased the costs and complexity of food production. Businesses operating in the US agricultural supply, processing, distribution, and retailing sectors are actively managing supply networks to reduce disruptions associated with climate change effects. Food systems that rely on external or distant resources and specialized production, supply, and marketing chains appear to be particularly vulnerable to global environmental change. These characteristics, widely recognized as critical challenges to the sustainability of the US food system, take on new importance as barriers to climate resilience.",10.1007/s13412-015-0290-4,Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences,Adaptive capacity | Agricultural production | Climate change | Food systems | Resilience | Vulnerability,84977151169,The vulnerability of the US food system to climate change,2015.0

Debates have largely centered around how to apply these concepts to specific types of business conduct, for example, whether a particular merger is efficient or a particular action will exclude equally efficient competitors from the market, while concerns about market structure have largely receded into the background. Business scholarship and practice, however, have begun to place an increasing emphasis on sustainability. Sustainability not only challenges the basic assumption of efficiency analysis that firms rationally pursue profit maximization, sustainability also suggests that overreliance on efficiency may be a trap that renders markets less resilient and more prone to collapse in the face of abrupt changes.

These process simulations provide invaluable information on the performance and capability of the specific process alternative considered. However, the development of many alternative technologies, along with multiple feedstock and product possibilities, made the superstructure based optimization methods the natural approaches to be pursued. These process superstructures can be efficiently optimized to provide insights into topological, economic, and environmental trade-offs by simultaneously weighing the strengths and weaknesses of each alternative. Despite the development of these powerful tools, several outstanding challenges need to be systematically addressed. These challenges include the implementation of different conversion technologies and feedstock types, investigating the production of a superset of fuels and chemicals, systematically addressing price uncertainties for robust refinery designs, and synthesizing a supply network optimization to potentially displace the petroleum demand.

Accordingly, there still exists a gap in the quantitative modeling of sustainable SCND that consists of OAP. In this article, we cover this gap through simultaneously considering the sustainable OAP in the sustainable SCND as a strategic decision. The proposed supply chain network is composed of five echelons including suppliers classified in different classes, plants, distribution centers that dispatch products via two different ways, direct shipment, and cross-docks, to satisfy stochastic demand received from a set of retailers. The problem has been mathematically formulated as a multi-objective optimization model that aims at minimizing the total costs and environmental effect of integrating SCND and OAP, simultaneously. To tackle the addressed problem, a novel multi-objective hybrid approach called MOHEV with two strategies for its best particle selection procedure (BPSP), minimum distance, and crowding distance is proposed. MOHEV is constructed through hybridization of two multi-objective algorithms, namely the adapted multi-objective electromagnetism mechanism algorithm (AMOEMA) and adapted multi-objective variable neighborhood search (AMOVNS). According to achieved results, MOHEV achieves better solutions compared with the others, and also crowding distance method for BPSP outperforms minimum distance.

The global economic structure, with its decentralized production and the consequent increase in freight traffic all over the world, creates considerable problems and challenges for the freight transport sector. This situation has led shipping to become the most suitable and cheapest way to transport goods. Thus, ports are configured as nodes with critical importance in the logistics supply chain as a link between two transport systems, sea and land. Increase in activity at seaports is producing three undesirable effects: increasing road congestion, lack of open space in port installations and a significant environmental impact on seaports. These adverse effects can be mitigated by moving part of the activity inland. Implementation of dry ports is a possible solution and would also provide an opportunity to strengthen intermodal solutions as part of an integrated and more sustainable transport chain, acting as a link between road and railway networks. In this sense, implementation of dry ports allows the separation of the links of the transport chain, thus facilitating the shortest possible routes for the lowest capacity and most polluting means of transport. Thus, the decision of where to locate a dry port demands a thorough analysis of the whole logistics supply chain, with the objective of transferring the largest volume of goods possible from road to more energy efficient means of transport, like rail or short-sea shipping, that are less harmful to the environment. However, the decision of where to locate a dry port must also ensure the sustainability of the site. Thus, the main goal of this article is to research the variables influencing the sustainability of dry port location and how this sustainability can be evaluated. With this objective, in this paper we present a methodology for assessing the sustainability of locations by the use of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and Bayesian Networks (BNs). MCDA is used as a way to establish a scoring, whilst BNs were chosen to eliminate arbitrariness in setting the weightings using a technique that allows us to prioritize each variable according to the relationships established in the set of variables. In order to determine the relationships between all the variables involved in the decision, giving us the importance of each factor and variable, we built a K2 BN algorithm. To obtain the scores of each variable, we used a complete cartography analysed by ArcGIS. Recognising that setting the most appropriate location to place a dry port is a geographical multidisciplinary problem, with significant economic, social and environmental implications, we consider 41 variables (grouped into 17 factors) which respond to this need. As a case of study, the sustainability of all of the 10 existing dry ports in Spain has been evaluated. In this set of logistics platforms, we found that the most important variables for achieving sustainability are those related to environmental protection, so the sustainability of the locations requires a great respect for the natural environment and the urban environment in which they are framed.",10.3846/16484142.2015.1081618,Transport,Bayesian networks | Delphi | dry ports | geographic information systems | industrial location | multi-criteria decision analysis | sustainability,84942945206,How should the sustainability of the location of dry ports be measured?

Schedules can be systematically repaired through specific modifications within buffers by using appropriate decision models that consider the distributed nature of a supply chain. To this aim, information of disruptive events at occurrence or in advance allows decision models to make better decisions. To detect and predict disruptive events along a schedule execution, a service-oriented monitoring subsystem that uses a reference model for defining monitoring models was proposed. This subsystem offers services for collecting execution data of a schedule and environment data, and assessing them to detect/anticipate disruptive events. Because of the distributed nature and the complexity of these services functionalities, this paper presents an agent-based approach for their implementation. This technology allows dealing with supply chain monitoring by structuring monitoring subsystem functionalities as a set of autonomous entities.

Globalization of the integrated circuit design and manufacturing flow has successfully ameliorated design complexity and fabrication cost challenges, and helped deliver cost-effective products while meeting stringent time-to-market requirements. On the flip side, it has resulted in various forms of security vulnerabilities in the supply chain that involves designers, fabs, test facilities, and distributors until the end-product reaches customers. One of the biggest threats to semiconductor industry today is the entry of aged, reject, or cloned parts, that is, counterfeit chips, into the supply chain, leading to annual revenue losses in the order of billions of dollars. While traceability of chips between trusted parties can help monitor the supply chain at various points in the flow, existing solutions are in the form of integrating costly hardware units on chip, or utilizing easy-to-circumvent inspection-based detection techniques. In this article, we propose a technique for adaptive unique ID generation that leverages process variations, enabling chip traceability. The proposed method stimulates digital chips with an analog signal from the supply lines, which serve as primary inputs to each gate in the signal path. Using a sinusoidal signal that exercises the transistors as gain components, we create a chip-specific response that can be post-processed into a digital ID. The proposed technique enables quick and cost-effective authenticity validation that requires no on-chip hardware support. Our simulation and experimentation on actual chips show that the proposed technique is capable of generating unique IDs even in the presence of environmental noise.",10.1145/2732408,ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems,Counterfeiting | Hardware security | ID generation,84934753761,Adaptive generation of unique IDs for digital chips through analog excitation,2015.0

Improving performance of global supply chains requires careful consideration of various factors including distance from markets, access to resources, exchange and tax rates, import tariffs, and trade regulations. In this paper, a comprehensive optimization model is proposed to maximise the after-tax profit of a closed-loop global supply chain for medical devices under uncertainty. The uncertainty of the decision-making environment is modelled using the budget of uncertainty concept in interval robust optimization. International financial issues due to the Economic Cooperation Organisation Trade Agreement as well as national regulations including transfer pricing limitations, exchange rates, tax rates, and import tariffs are considered. The proposed model considers various realistic assumptions pertaining to medical device supply chains such as multiple products, multiple periods, multiple echelons, and limited warehousing lifetime. In addition, reverse flows of perished and defective products are considered to address environmental concerns and customers requirements as well as to gain economic advantages. To tackle this problem, an efficient memetic algorithm is developed that incorporates adaptive variable neighbourhood search as its local search heuristic.

Supply chain formation (SCF) is the process of determining the set of participants and exchange relationships within a network with the goal of setting up a supply chain that meets some predefined social objective. Many proposed solutions for the SCF problem rely on centralized computation, which presents a single point of failure and can also lead to problems with scalability. Decentralized techniques that aid supply chain emergence offer a more robust and scalable approach by allowing participants to deliberate between themselves about the structure of the optimal supply chain. Current decentralized supply chain emergence mechanisms are only able to deal with simplistic scenarios in which goods are produced and traded in single units only and without taking into account production capacities or input-output ratios other than 1:1. In this paper, we demonstrate the performance of a graphical inference technique, max-sum loopy belief propagation (LBP), in a complex multiunit unit supply chain emergence scenario which models additional constraints such as production capacities and input-to-output ratios. We also provide results demonstrating the performance of LBP in dynamic environments, where the properties and composition of participants are altered as the algorithm is running. Our results suggest that max-sum LBP produces consistently strong solutions on a variety of network structures in a multiunit problem scenario, and that performance tends not to be affected by on-the-fly changes to the properties or composition of participants.",10.1109/TSMC.2014.2351782,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",Max-sum algorithm | mechanism design | supply chain formation (SCF),84923234044,Using the max-sum algorithm for supply chain emergence in dynamic multiunit environments,2015.0

Based on the theoretical underpinnings of the relational view of competitive advantage, the current study investigates the performance implications of three critical relational resource elements in supply chain partnerships: resource specificity, resource complementarity, and supply chain collaboration. The research also explores the interrelationship dynamics among these sources of relational rent - critical to the understanding of superior supply chain performance. The study models environmental dynamism and complexity to investigate the nature of the relationships among relational resources as they interact with technological and market turbulence factors. Operational productivity improvements are the primary outcome measures in the current research. Empirical evidence, based on the survey data of a cross-section of US manufacturing firms from a wide range of industries, supports a majority of our arguments, thus providing critical theoretical and managerial insights. The findings reiterate the importance of collaborative initiatives in the supply chain for operational benefits and high levels of customer service. The results also shed light on the interrelationships among relational resource elements, filling inadequacies in previous literature: resource specificity and complementarity are found to be antecedents of collaboration.

663,"© 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Currently, reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and fuel consumption has become a critical environmental problem and has attracted the attention of both academia and the industrial sector. Government regulations and customer demands are making environmental responsibility an increasingly important factor in overall supply chain operations. Within these operations, transportation has the most hazardous effects on the environment, i.e., CO2 emissions, fuel consumption, noise and toxic effects on the ecosystem. This study aims to construct vehicle routes with time windows that minimize the total fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. The green vehicle routing problem with time windows (G-VRPTW) is formulated using a mixed integer linear programming model. A memory structure adapted simulated annealing (MSA-SA) meta-heuristic algorithm is constructed due to the high complexity of the proposed problem and long solution times for practical applications. The proposed models are integrated with a fuel consumption and CO2 emissions calculation algorithm that considers the vehicle technical specifications, vehicle load, and transportation distance in a green supply chain environment. The proposed models are validated using well-known instances with different numbers of customers. The computational results indicate that the MSA-SA heuristic is capable of obtaining good G-VRPTW solutions within a reasonable amount of time by providing reductions in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.",10.1007/s11356-014-3253-5,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,CO  emissions 2 | Fuel consumption | Green logistics | Green vehicle routing problem | Mixed integer linear programming model | Simulated annealing algorithm,84933516240,A memory structure adapted simulated annealing algorithm for a green vehicle routing problem,2015.0

In an increasingly interconnected world, physical, service, and digital supply networks are becoming progressively more complex, dynamic, and interdependent. Moreover, sustainability concerns push for higher efficiency in the use of resources, reducing protective redundancies and making supply networks more susceptible to disruptions. Supply network resilience is an emerging concept related to the inherent ability of a network to tolerate and overcome disruptions, a central capacity to achieve long term-sustainable operations. However, current understanding of the impact of network formation and re-configuration mechanisms on resilience is at its early stages. In this article, resilience by teaming (RBT) association decisions, inspired in the fault-tolerance by teaming principle from Collaborative Control Theory, are characterized and applied in network formation and re-configuration mechanisms. The impact of RBT on emerging supply network topology and resilience under targeted and random disruptions is measured and compared to scenarios were only traditional association rules are applied. Results show that the introduction of supply network agents using RBT association rules significantly (1) increases quality of service (QoS) with no significant cost increase in normal operation, (2) increases post-disruption QoS by 15-30% under random disruptions and 10% under targeted disruptions without cost increase vs. normal operation - when at least 20% of the agents use RBT association rules.",10.1016/j.ijpe.2014.09.036,International Journal of Production Economics,Collaborative Control Theory | Complex adaptive systems | Complex networks | Fault-tolerance by teaming | Supplier selection,84920540159,Resilience by teaming in supply network formation and re-configuration,2015.0

Despite its potential benefits in a wide range of circumstances, firm innovativeness received scant attention in relation to managing the various risks and uncertainties in the global business environment. Likewise, there is still a limited understanding of firms’ supply chain resilience (SCR) and its related antecedents in the strategic management literature. This research focuses on exploring the relationship between firm innovativeness and SCR in an attempt to facilitate bridging the gap between two important research streams and shed some light on the contingent value of firm innovativeness against disruptions and adversities. The moderating role of supply uncertainty and interdependence in the focal relationship was also hypothesised and tested. Findings suggest that firm innovativeness is positively associated with firm SCR, and supply uncertainty negatively moderates this relationship but interdependence does not. We argue that this could be due to the dual nature of interdependence in supply networks.",10.1080/09537325.2014.971003,Technology Analysis and Strategic Management,environmental uncertainty | firm innovativeness | interdependence | supply chain resilience,84923177036,How does firm innovativeness enable supply chain resilience?

Hence, consumer behaviour has begun to change as they have started to assess the environmental impacts of the products and services they buy. Although various methods exist for measuring environmental (e.g. carbon) impacts, there is no international consensus about the most appropriate one. In addition, calculations can also be affected by limited data availability and uncertainty surrounding the value of key variables. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for measuring and analysing the carbon footprint in supply chains. This research contributes to the knowledge and practice of green supply chain management, at the corporate level, by providing robustness. This aids the decision-making process by identifying strategies in order to reach the efficiency that can be achieved by reducing CO2 emission over the supply network.

Customer demand is rapidly changing in todays turbulent environment, and organisation must be responsive enough to meet these changes. The responsiveness of the organisation incurs cost, and a trade-off between responsiveness and efficiency is necessary to meet organisation strategy for enabling competitive advantage. Information integration across the supply chain enables the network to respond quickly to continuously changing customer demand. The potential screened suppliers are evaluated in a dynamic environment using beer game simulation for limited and system-wide information availability. The simulation is run for stable and random orders to get results for varied inventory levels and bullwhip effect (order fluctuations). Thus, the selected and evaluated suppliers enabled prioritisation of the suppliers to meet the organisations strategic objectives. The results from the study suggested that the inventory level and bullwhip effect reduced significantly as a result of integrating the information for both stable and random orders. Thus, a robust framework is devised for long-term decision-making in enabling an organisation to meet its strategic objectives. The paper focuses on devising a structured methodology for supplier selection which is an important decision in a supply chain. After initial evaluation of potential suppliers, the decision-making involves selecting suppliers. The decision-making must fulfil the firm to be responsive to customer while also serving the purpose of cost efficiency. Thus, by properly tuning the information integration in a supply network, the methodology suitably quantifies the inventory levels and bull-whip effect for effective decision-making.",10.1080/09537287.2014.1002024,Production Planning and Control,beer game simulation | bull whip effect | decision making | inventory levels | stable and random orders,84938416495,Impact of information integration on decision-making in a supply chain network,2015.0

This paper aims to establish a conceptual model for mitigating supply chain risk by introducing two variables named supply chain integration and organizational risk propensity. Based on extensive literature review, some major propositions are proposed including the following four aspects: supply chain risk is negatively related to supply chain integration; supply chain integration is positively related to company performance; organizational risk propensity moderates the relationship between supply chain risk and supply chain integration; the integrative model is moderated-mediation. The integrative model is theoretically valuable in further exploring the internal path and mechanism of the impact of supply chain risk on a firm's performance.

Recently, reshoring is an emerging trend due to various complexities involved in supply chain management. As compared with basic textile and apparel products, fast fashion products are complex in their own way. A single assortment contains several new styles, colors, and sizes with unpredictable demand and urgent deadlines. Numerous assortments run simultaneously in the supply chain. For each assortment, the garment manufacturer has to source various types of fabrics and materials from different suppliers and then manufacture the garments to ship within the deadlines. This complexity contributes to supply chain disruption. This paper develops a model to estimate supply chain disruption cost as a function of fast fashion product complexity in the global outsourcing environment. Estimation of disruption cost will help us to increase visibility and eliminate the bottlenecks in supply chain. Model conclusions are used to develop a method to manage the level of product complexity from the global supply chain perspective.

Such competitiveness depends on the SCN resources a manufacturing firm can allocate, the capabilities to identify and deploy these network resources effectively, and practices and applications the firm arranges for these resources. The purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework that investigates the relationships between these network constructs and their influences on firm performance. Design/methodology/approach - An extensive literature review of supply chain management was conducted to explicate why some manufacturers outperform others. A resource-based view, dynamic capability theory, and extended resource-based view were employed to develop a conceptual model that investigates relationships between the resources, capabilities, and practices of a SCN. The relationships were then examined to analyze their influences on firm performance. Several cases and practical examples were included in the study to give a better understanding of the conceptual research model. Various keywords were used in searching literature for the constructs of the research model. For example, ""knowledge"" and ""supply chain network"" were used to search the literature regarding the SCN intangible resources. Findings - This study uses a conceptual model to identify SCN resources that are dispersed in the internal territory among different network members, SCN capabilities that are developed based on these network resources and lead to the firm's competitive performance, and SCN practices used to acquire network resources and build network capabilities. Research limitations/implications - The conceptual model of SCN resources, capabilities, and practices needs further empirical validation. Practical implications - The conceptual model provides a framework for managers to identify the critical resources, capabilities, and practices of a SCN that help a firm achieve sustainable competitive performance. Originality/value - This research builds a comprehensive picture of relationships between a manufacturing firm's strategic resources, capabilities, and practices in a SCN.

Cross border movement of goods faces diverse difficulties and creates bottlenecks in the supply chain. Complex products involve numerous parts and complications in the assembly process, resulting in multiple border-crossings with varying level of complexity across multiple countries before reaching to the customers. This activity contributes to the supply chain disruption risk. Border crossing is unavoidable in global supply chains, and how to integrate border crossing complexity in supply chain models is an unresolved issue. This paper suggests an approach to quantify the border crossing complexity and its impact on the supply chain disruption risk in the global outsourcing environment. Results show that key factors which contribute to border crossing complexity include product complexity, trade procedures, and various bottlenecks at each bordercrossing.

In this paper, we describe an agent-based model that explores the impacts of farmer coordination decisions on the development of food supply chain structure over time. This model focuses on one type of coordination mechanism implementation method, in which coordinated farmer groups produce a single crop type and combine their yields to achieve economies of scale. The farmer agents' decisions to coordinate with one another depend on their evaluation of the tradeoff between their autonomy and the expected economic benefits of coordination. Each coordination decision is a bilateral process in which the terms of group reward sharing are negotiated. We capture the effects of farmers' size, income, and autonomy premia, as well as volume-price relationships and group profit-sharing rules, on the rate of farmer coordination and the number and size of groups that form.

During the last decade, as the overexploitation and scarcity of the global natural water resources have led to a plethora of negative environmental, social and economic impacts, the preservation of freshwater resources has emerged as a major challenge for governmental authorities, businesses and consumers. To that effect, the concept of water footprint (WF) has been introduced at a national, corporate and product level. Since national WFs are obtained mainly from agricultural production and food manufacturing or processing operations, WF assessment and management are considered to be of utmost importance for the agrifood industry. In this context, several agrifood companies map the WF of their supply chain networks as a part of their corporate social responsibility programmes. In this manuscript, we first review the scientific literature and several real-world corporate sustainability reports and we then provide a critical taxonomy of management policies that mitigate the water WF at each echelon of an agrifood supply chain (AFSC). Following that, a firsteffort System Dynamics (SD) model that effectively captures the dynamics of the WF and water scarcity along the entire supply chains of agrifood products is developed. The obtained simulation results reveal the need for responsible freshwater management across AFSCs in order to reduce the total WF and to further create a green corporate image. The literature taxonomy along with the proposed SD modelling approach is anticipated to provide value-added managerial insights with respect to corporate policy-making interventions towards the sustainable development of the agrifood sector.",10.3303/CET1543020,Chemical Engineering Transactions,,84946100762,Water footprint management policies for agrifood supply chains: A critical taxonomy and a system dynamics modelling approach,2015.0

Increasing trend in global business integration and movement of material around the world has caused supply chain system susceptible to disruption involving higher risks. This paper presents a methodology for supplier selection in a global sourcing environment by considering multiple cost and risk factors. Failure modes and effects analysis technique from reliability engineering field and Bayesian belief networks are used to quantify the risk posed by each factor. The probability and the cost of each risk are then incorporated into a decision tree model to compute the total expected costs for each supply option. The supplier selection decision is made based on the total purchasing costs including both deterministic costs (such as product and transportation costs) and the risk-associated costs.

So, the selection of the most satisfying computer-aided design (CAD) software which enables to exchange data through supply chain network has been major issues for companies in a supply chain. The selection process of CAD software among the raising number of alternatives in the market has been very vital and critical issue for companies that aim to make their design and engineering related activities automated towards computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) environment. Therefore, most companies have used various methods to successfully carry out this difficult and time-consuming process. Of these methods, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been widely used for Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problems in both academic researches and practices. But, in some cases, due to the vagueness and uncertainty on judgments of the decisionmaker(s), the crisp pair wise comparison in the conventional AHP seems to be insufficient and imprecise to capture the right judgments of decision-maker(s). Therefore, a fuzzy logic is introduced in the pair wise comparison of AHP to make up for this deficiency in the conventional AHP, called as fuzzy AHP. In this paper, a fuzzy AHP-based approach is proposed to evaluate a set of CAD software alternatives in the market to reach the best satisfying one based on the needs of company.",,International Journal of Supply Chain Management,Analytic hierarchy process | Computer-aided design | Fuzzy logic | Multiple-criteria decision making | Supply chain management,84949765522,Cad software evaluation for product design to exchange data in a supply chain network,2015.0

The participating firms were classified into focal, downstream, and upstream firms. The data set was grouped in two namely aggregate which includes all the firms and independent data which consists of each firm's classification. Partial Least Squares (PLS) method was used to identify the determinants of green practices. The aggregate data show that external environmental factors (including customer pressures, regulatory pressures, government supports, and environmental uncertainty) were the most important in adopting green practices. For the focal firms, the independent data show that relative advantage, quality of human resources and customer pressure are positively associated with the adoption of green practice and they positively influence operations systems' performance. Conversely, the downstream firms are more efficient and effective when there are organizational and governmental supports. For upstream firms, the critical factors to organizational performance are compatibility, customer and regulatory pressures. In both the downstream and upstream firms, the factor complexity which denotes the lack of understanding and learning of green practices is the key barrier to implementing green practices. Knowledge of these critical factors for green supply chain management practice would help Chinese firms to become more environmentally responsible while simultaneously achieving their operational performance goals.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.02.030,Journal of Cleaner Production,Corporate performance | Determinant factors | Green supply chain,84927174578,Determinants and associated performance improvement of green supply chain management in China,2015.0

Implementing comprehensive service contracts and sustainable supply chains are two recent trends that create the opportunity to develop maintenance contracts with an uptime guarantee for the customer and a remanufacturing process for removed parts. This involves management decisions on the design of the contract (price, uptime guarantee and overhaul interval) and the logistics network (facility locations, capacities and inventories with given service level). These two decision levels are interrelated: the number of contracts is a function of price and machine uptime, while this uptime is affected by the overhaul interval and network responsiveness. Steady-state queueing equations explicitly model the stochastic nature of the problem, e.g. the impact of resource utilization levels on lead time of the remanufacturing process. This approach results in a non-linear mixed integer model, which is solved by a differential evolution algorithm to find the maximum profit that simultaneously optimizes both problems. A real-life application reveals that price sensitivity is a critical determinant and that measures must be taken to tackle the problem of moral hazard.",10.1016/j.cor.2014.10.003,Computers and Operations Research,Contract design | Network design | Queueing | Remanufacturing,84912076969,Network and contract optimization for maintenance services with remanufacturing,2015.0

Purpose – The purpose of this technical viewpoint is to provide a commentary of how we went about using logistics prototyping as a method to engage citizens, science fiction (SF) writers and small- to medium- sized enterprises (SME’s). Six urban logistic prototypes built on the themes of future cities, community resilience and urban supply chain management (SCM) are summarized, together with details of the data collection procedure and the methodological challenges encountered. Our investigation aimed to explore the potential of logistics prototyping to develop “user-driven” and “SME” approaches to future city design and urban supply chain decision-making. Design/methodology/approach – This Boston field experiment was a case study investigation conducted between May and August 2013. Qualitative data was collected using a “mixed-method” approach combining together focus groups (MIT faculty), scenarios, prototyping workshops, interviews and document analysis. These story-creators could use the prototype method as a way of testing their hypotheses, theories and constrained speculations with regard to specified future city and urban supply chain scenarios. Findings – This viewpoint suggests that the prototyping method allows for unique individual perspectives on future city planning and urban supply chain design. This work also attempts to demonstrate that prototyping can create sufficiently cogent environments for future city and urban SCM theories to be both detected and analysed therein. Although this is an experimental field of the SCM theory building, more conventional theories could also be “tested” in the same manner. Research limitations/implications – By embedding logistics prototyping within a mixed method approach, we might be criticized as constraining its capability to map out the future – that its potential to be flexible and imaginative are held back by the equal weighting given to the more conventional component. In basing our case study within one city then this might be seen as limiting the complexity of the empirical context – however, the situation within different cities is inherently complex. Case studies also attract criticism on the grounds of not being representative; in this situation, they might be criticized as imperfect indicators of what transpires in other situations. However, this technical viewpoint suggests that in spite of its limitations, prototyping facilitates an imaginative and creative approach to theory generation and concept building. Practical implications – The methodology allows everyday citizens and SME’s to develop user-driven foresight and planning scenarios with city strategists’ and urban logistic designers. It facilitates much broader stakeholder involvement in city and urban supply chain policymaking, than current “quantitative” approaches. Social implications – Logistics fiction prototyping provides a democratic approach to future city planning and urban supply chain design. It involves collectively imagining socio-technical futures and second-order sociological effects through the writing of SF narratives or building “design fictions”. Originality/value – Decision-making in future cities and urban SCM is often a notable challenge, balancing the varying needs and claims of multiple stakeholders, while negotiating an acceptable trade-off between their competing claims. Engagement with stakeholders and active encouragement of stakeholder participation in the supply chain aspects of future cities is increasingly a feature of twenty-first century social decision-making. This viewpoint suggests that the prototyping method allows for unique individual perspectives on future city planning and urban supply chain design. This work also attempts to demonstrate that prototyping can create sufficiently cogent environments for future city and the urban SCM theories to be both detected and analysed therein.

Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) has become a very useful initiative for industries to improve their environmental capabilities in terms of, reducing resources consumption and ensuring sustainable production in business. However, the effectiveness of Green Supply Chain (GSC) is comparatively low, as there has been a substantial amount of risk involved in managing GSC efficiently. In this contribution, therefore, we aim to identify and prioritize/rank the responses of risks in a GSC context. It would be useful for industries to focus on highly ranked responses and formulate strategies to practice them in accordance with their priority for managing the consequences of risks in GSC. The present research seeks to propose a model by using the fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and fuzzy Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods to prioritize the responses in GSC to manage its risks under the fuzzy environment. The fuzzy AHP is useful in deciding the importance weights of the related GSC risks. While, by using the fuzzy TOPSIS, the priority/ranking of the responses in a successful accomplishment of green initiatives is determined. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, the GSCM real-world case of an Indian poly-plastic manufacturing company is presented. The model proposed would offer a scientific analytic means to the managers/business professionals/practitioners for systematic implementation of the responses of risks relevant to adoption and effective implementation of green initiatives in business.

Uncertainty is defined by discrete scenarios on demands where occurrence probability of each scenario is known. The optimization objectives are to minimize transit time and total cost, including opening cost, assumed for opening potential DCs and shipping cost from DCs to the customers, where considering different types of vehicles leads to a more realistic model and causes more conict in these two objectives. A swarm intelligence-based algorithm named Non-dominated Sorting Ant Colony Optimization (NSACO) is used as the optimization tool. The proposed methodology is based on a new variant of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) customized in multi-objective optimization problem of this research.

In response, palm oil production is rapidly expanding which promotes economic growth in producing countries but also leads to serious environmental and social problems such as destruction of tropical forests, climate change and threats to small-holder livelihoods. For these reasons, palm oil production and use have become highly controversial. However, the global character of palm oil production and consumption, the number of different actors involved and its multiple uses makes promotion its sustainability highly complex. Individual nation-states can no longer control and regulate a global flow like palm oil and alternative governing networks appear involving private companies and NGOs. Acknowledging the roles of such governance networks with different forms of power means that relying only on economic and political power to explain current dynamics in the palm oil sector is inadequate. In global networks like palm oil supply, encompassing transnational material flows and multiple actors, the relevance of each actor relates to his position in the network. Power in global palm oil supply is therefore not only related to their position in the (vertical) supply chains, but also to their role in the horizontal networks. New forms of power in networks arise from steering the networks (programming) and from connecting different networks (switching). In the multiple networks that compose global palm oil provision today, different programmers and switchers play critical roles. This is briefly illustrated in this paper on the basis of different cases of active steering in global palm oil provision.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.01.019,Journal of Cleaner Production,Environmental flows | Environmental governance | Global networks | Palm oil,84942984886,Promoting sustainable palm oil: Viewed from a global networks and flows perspective,2015.0

Purpose – Supply chain (SC) is a homogeneous and interconnected network of firms which manages supplies, storages and handles material, information, personnel, equipment and final products throughout its length. The SC can be the means by which businesses add value to customers and therefore competitive advantage in the international market. Competitiveness no longer exists among individual members of a SC but between SCs. International literature pointed out, that strategy and competitiveness associated with specific strategic priorities. In this paper will be documented that the priorities as objectives of strategic importance comprise the key areas for the performance of the SC network. To support this, a systematic framework of strategic priorities, will be developed, which will visualize the major SC assessment areas that the SC network should turn its improvement efforts. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – In total, 200 high level managers from 71 Greek manufacturing companies covering the whole country using their own SC networks took part in the study. Data analysis were conducted to create a model that describes the strategic priorities which are important, for the competitive advantage of their SC network. Findings – The results revealed seven critical strategic priorities: internal flexibility, production quality, waste reduction, customer focus, sustainability, reduction of production cost and efficiency. This paper analytically explores the strategic practices that seem to influence SC network performance and generates a systematic framework of the critical strategic priorities of the SC network performance. Practical implications – The proposed framework has six major advantages. First the research outcome enables managers to design their SC strategy. Second, proved the great importance of the strategic priorities institutionalization. Third, makes clear to stakeholders which are the SC network performance issues to consider. Fourth, the proposed framework could serve as a suitable formula for assessing the effectiveness and readiness of SC to face the competition. Fifth, it is an effective way of prioritizing the strategic practices as it provides the most important areas on which the firm can base tasks like evaluation, benchmarking and comparison of its SC both as a network and as individual firms. Finally, the proposed framework is an effective way to evaluate the consistency of strategic objectives and actions adopted for the SC. Originality/value – Literature review revealed a very important conclusion. It has been developed a broad discussion concerning issues on strategic practices which are responsible for the competitive advantage of the SC network. However, there has not been a significant effort on integrating all the practices under the spectrum of the SC in order to distinguish the most important of these practices that can lead to competitive advantages.",10.1108/BPMJ-12-2014-0120,Business Process Management Journal,Competitive advantage | Factor analysis | Priorities | Strategic practices | Structural equation modelling | Supply chain network,84944556958,Towards the identification of important strategic priorities of the supply chain network: An empirical investigation,2015.0

Track-and-trace anti-counterfeiting demands a trustworthy electronic pedigree (e-pedigree), which records the movements of product items from manufacturers to retailers, to ensure high supply chain visibility and to provide evidence for product authentication. Creation and synchronization of initial e-pedigrees in the manufacturing stage is particularly crucial to the accuracy and trustworthiness of subsequent processing of the e-pedigrees and authentication of product items. This is a critical yet challenging task, as it involves a number of practical issues, such as incomplete tag writing/locking, environment disturbances, and potential data falsification. This paper first presents an innovative track-and-trace anti-counterfeiting system, and then proposes a tag data processing and synchronization (TDPS) algorithm to generate initial e-pedigrees for general, tangible products during production. An RFID-enabled apparel packaging line is established to validate the performance of TDPS and identify the bottleneck of e-pedigree generation. Experiment results show that TDPS can create accurate and secure initial e-pedigrees for fast moving product items, and that tag EPC writing is a major bottleneck of e-pedigree generation. Thus, we optimise TDPS by incorporating a block writing method and an integrated verification step to remove the bottleneck. Further experiments demonstrate the optimised TDPS can be adapted to suit different practical requirements to achieve a good balance between tag writing/locking rate and the moving speed of product items in packaging lines without severing the throughput.",10.1016/j.compind.2015.01.004,Computers in Industry,Anti-counterfeiting | Data synchronization | e-Pedigree | RFID | Tag programming | Track-and-trace,84923633983,RFID tag data processing in manufacturing for track-and-trace anti-counterfeiting,2015.0

The use of analytical approaches has become more and more critical for forecasting the water supply and demand balance in the long run. In this research, Istanbul's water supply and demand data is collected for the period during 2006 and 2014. Then, using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, the time series water supply and demand forecasting model is constructed for the period between 2015 and 2018. Three important sustainability metrics such as water loss to supply ratio, water loss to demand ratio, and water loss to residential demand ratio are also presented. The findings show that residential water demand is responsible for nearly 80% of total water use and the consumption categories including commercial, industrial, agriculture, outdoor, and others have a lower share in total water demand. The results also show that there is a considerable water loss in the water distribution system which requires significant investments on the water supply networks. Furthermore, the forecasting results indicated that pipeline projects will be critical in the near future due to expected increases in the total water demand of Istanbul. The authors suggest that sustainable management of water can be achieved by reducing the residential water use through the use of water efficient technologies in households and reduction in water supply loss through investments on distribution infrastructure.",10.3390/su70811050,Sustainability (Switzerland),ARIMA | Demand | Istanbul | Time-series forecasting | Urban water sustainability | Water supply,84940513123,A framework for sustainable urban water management through demand and supply forecasting: The case of Istanbul,2015.0

In fact, at a time of crisis it seems that the territories are even more vulnerable and fragile: emerging social issues (like new poverty), new needs, frayed social fabrics and lack of social networks.

South Africa’s extensive mineral resources have resulted in mining activities dispersed across the country, playing a critical role in its socio-economic development. In contrast to this abundance of mineral wealth, water resources are generally limited, and vulnerable to environmental impacts from the mining industry. These circumstances make tailored management of water resources in the mining sector essential. To achieve this, detailed information on water use throughout a mine operation as well as an accurate water balance account is required. Blue-water footprints have the potential to contribute to this task as they allow for quantification of direct and indirect water use across the supply chain of a process, while incorporating both spatial extension and temporal duration. As defined by the Water Footprint Network’s (WFN) globally acknowledged water footprint assessment methodology, a blue-water footprint is determined by calculating the net consumptive use of water by an operation. According to the WFN, this includes water which is evaporated, incorporated into a product, or lost to outflows which do not return to the same catchment area in the same period.The applicability of this tool in the mining sector has not been fully explored. Therefore, it was decided to investigate the bluewater footprint of a South African platinum mining operation. The results showed that the largest consumption of water in the production of platinum was due to evaporation from the mineral processing plants (36.8%) and the tailings storage facilities (19.4%). To improve its water-use efficiency, measures should be taken by the operation to mitigate evaporative losses. Floating covers can assist in this effort as they reflect a proportion of the incoming solar radiation and act as a physical barrier to the passage of water vapour, both vertically and horizontally.",10.4314/wsa.v41i2.15,Water SA,Cleaner production | Footprinting | Platinum group metals,84929405160,Assessing the blue-water footprint of an opencast platinum mine in South Africa,2015.0

Commodity chains are processes of extraction, production, transport, distribution, consumption and disposal of goods and services.

It advocates the idea that the challenges of maintaining a safe food supply are best addressed by integrating modeling and mathematics with biological studies critical to formulation of public policy to address these challenges. Much information on the biology and epidemiology of food animal systems has been characterized through single-discipline methods, but until now this information has not been thoroughly utilized in a fully integrated manner.The examples are drawn from our current research. The first, explained in depth, uses clinical mastitis to introduce the concept of dynamic programming to optimize management decisions in dairy cows (also introducing the curse of dimensionality problem). In the second example, a compartmental epidemic model for Johne's disease with different intervention strategies is optimized. The goal of the optimization strategy depends on whether there is a relationship between Johne's and Crohn's disease. If so, optimization is based on eradication of infection; if not, it is based on the cow's performance only (i.e., economic optimization, similar to the mastitis example). The third example focuses on food safety to introduce risk assessment using Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella Typhimurium. The last example, practical interventions to effectively manage antibiotic resistance in beef and dairy cattle systems, introduces meta-population modeling that accounts for bacterial growth not only in the host (cow), but also in the cow's feed, drinking water and the housing environment. Each example stresses the need to progress toward multi-scale modeling. The article ends with examples of multi-scale systems, from food supply systems to Johne's disease.Reducing the consequences of foodborne illnesses (i.e., minimizing disease occurrence and associated costs) can only occur through an understanding of the system as a whole, including all its complexities. Thus the goal of future research should be to merge disciplines such as molecular biology, applied mathematics and social sciences to gain a better understanding of complex systems such as the food supply chain.",10.1016/j.prevetmed.2014.08.013,Preventive Veterinary Medicine,Dynamic programming | Food supply system | Infectious disease modeling | Multi-scale modeling | Risk assessment | System science,84921538693,Progression to multi-scale models and the application to food system intervention strategies,2015.0

Uncertainties surrounding the continued operation of older coal generation units, the increased penetration of renewable resources, and the aging or retirement of certain nuclear units have exposed vulnerabilities in the natural gas supply chain. The increased availability and low price of natural gas for electric generation in many parts of the United States compounds them by increasing the economic pressure on various non-gas-fired base-load generation plants. Our growing dependence on natural gas as a primary fuel for electricity generation offers environmental and efficiency benefits, but it also presents operational challenges for independent system operators (ISOs) and regional transmission organizations (RTOs) that depend on the natural gas pipeline and storage network to facilitate reliability objectives. During the peak heating season, pipeline congestion can result in interruptions of gas deliveries to those gas-fired generators lacking primary firm entitlements. Scheduling restrictions associated with the provision of nonfirm transportation for gas-fired generators stress the capability of the electric system to meet demand and maintain operating reserves, as RTOs must quickly replace output from more efficient natural gas-fueled combined-cycle plants and quick-start peakers to maintain electric reliability. In this article, we address the gas-electric interdependencies across the Eastern Interconnection that are the subject of a multitarget research project sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) with the participation of PJM Interconnection, Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), New York Independent System Operator (NYISO), ISO New England (ISO-NE), TVA, and the Independent Electricity System Operator of Ontario (IESO), collectively known as the participating planning authorities (PPAs).",10.1109/MPE.2014.2347632,IEEE Power and Energy Magazine,,84908353978,Pipeline to reliability: Unraveling gas and electric interdependencies across the eastern interconnection,2014.0
708,"© 2014 International Information Institute. In the current, global, supply-chain environment, transport facilitation is needed to ensure efficient e-Business services, improved inventory visibility, and reliable production operations. The ability to provide electronic, real-time, logistics information is a critical aspect of this facilitation. This information could be used to track accurately the flow of goods as they make their way from port to port and from supplier to supplier until they reach their final destination. To realize these benefits, logistics providers have been implementing or upgrading their tracking systems using new technologies including radio frequency identification (RFID) and sensor networks. The ubiquitous availability of such technologies, improves the preparedness and resilience of the maritime transportation industry. These technologies can also provide the infrastructure needed to monitor and improve the sustainability of that industry. This paper proposes a logistics service model that provides the real-time and correct information necessary to achieve this sustainability goal.",,Information (Japan),Global supply chain | Maritime logistics | Radio frequency identification | Sensor network | Ubiquitous technology,84938924710,Logistics service model for sustainability of supply chain,2014.0
709,"Purpose Managing processed food products' safety and recall is a challenge for industry and governments. Contaminated food items can create a significant public health hazard with potential for acute and chronic food borne illnesses. This industry study examines the challenges companies face while managing a processed food recall situation and devise a responsive and reliable knowledge management framework for product safety and recall supply chain for the focal global manufacturing and distribution enterprise. Method Drawing upon the knowledge management and product safety and recall literature and reliability engineering theory, this study uses a holistic single case based approach to develop a knowledge management framework with Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) decision model. This knowledge management decision framework facilitates analysis of the root causes for each potential major recall issue and assesses the reliability of the product safety and recall supply chain system and its critical components. Results The main reasons highlighted for a recall and associated failure modes in a knowledge management framework are to devise appropriate deployment of resources, technology and procedures to recall supply chain. This study underscores specific information described by managers of a global processed food manufacturer and their perspectives about the product safety and recall process, and its complexities. Full scale implementation of product safety and recall supply chain in the proposed knowledge management framework after the current pilot study will be carried out eventually through expert systems. This operational system when fully implemented will capture the essence of decision making environments comprising goals and objectives, courses of action, resources, constraints, technology and procedures. Implications The study recognizes the significance of communication, integration, failsafe knowledge management process design framework, leveraging technology such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) within all levels of supply chain for product traceability and the proactive steps to help companies successfully manage a recall process and also reestablish trust among the consumers. The proposed knowledge management framework can also preempt product recall by acting as an early warning system. A formal knowledge management framework will enable a company's knowledge be cumulative for product safety and recall and serve as an important integrating and coordinating role for the organization. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

710,"© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012. Distributed resource allocation is a very important and complex problem in emerging horizontal dynamic cloud federation (HDCF) platforms, where different cloud providers (CPs) collaborate dynamically to gain economies of scale and enlargements of their virtual machine (VM) infrastructure capabilities in order to meet consumer requirements. HDCF platforms differ from the existing vertical supply chain federation (VSCF) models in terms of establishing federation and dynamic pricing. There is a need to develop algorithms that can capture this complexity and easily solve distributed VM resource allocation problem in a HDCF platform. In this paper, we propose a cooperative game-theoretic solution that is mutually beneficial to the CPs. It is shown that in non-cooperative environ-ment, the optimal aggregated benefit received by the CPs is not guaranteed. We study two utility maximizing cooperative resource allocation games in a HDCF environment. We use price-based resource allocation strategy and present both centralized and distributed algorithms to find optimal solutions to these games. Various simulations were carried out to verify the proposed algorithms. The simulation results demonstrate that the algorithms are effective, showing robust performance for resource allocation and requiring minimal computation time.",10.1007/s10796-012-9357-x,Information Systems Frontiers,Cooperative games | Distributed resource allocation | Horizontal dynamic cloud federation | Vertical supply chain federation,84914684710,Cooperative game-based distributed resource allocation in horizontal dynamic cloud federation platform,2014.0
711,"© 2014, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to overview carefully selected existing literature to enable further analysis directly concerned with facilities management (FM) supply chain structure, components, strategic issues, challenges and risk. Following the key aspects of assembly, design and, most importantly, management of FM supply chain are explored so that a guidance design framework can be put forward. Design/methodology/approach – This paper examines the optimum technique that can be applied by clients and FM service providers where FM functions are outsourced. The paper initially defines the network structure of the FM supply chain and then suggests a conceptual model for making decisions about FM supply chain network at the strategy level. Furthermore, the paper argues for both supply chain design and for critical node micro management in a transparent supply chain environment with the FM acting as the strategic lens through which the focus of the supply chain is achieved. Findings – This paper presents a process for designing and making decisions of FM service supply chain network. The process begins with an examination of the needs of facility services. It is followed by the step of identifying available options in delivering and processing the services. The third stage involves modelling structures of FM supply chain network. Then to make a final decision, all possible models have to be evaluated for their optimisation, both quantitative (cost) and qualitative (performance). At the end, the model with best optimisation should be selected. Originality/value – This paper proposes a conceptual framework for designing facility service supply chain strategy and configuration to fit with the specific nature of facility service demand of a given organisation. The framework, featuring a set of processes including examining demand nature, identifying options available and analysing options, is first aimed at providing an assisting tool in identifying optimum supply chain network/solution of facility services and, second, intends to stimulate further discussions on this continuously evolving and challenging market.",10.1108/JFM-08-2013-0043,Journal of Facilities Management,Facility management | Facility services | Optimum technique | Supply chain design | Supply chain management | Working environments,85019729530,Designing and managing the Optimum strategic FM supply chain,2014.0
712,"Copyright © 2014 IGI Global. Supply chain networks have expanded globally in today’s business environment due to cost efficiencies, advanced technology, and market growth. This expansion makes the supply chains more vulnerable to disruption risks in different countries. A disruption in one country can cause serious global impacts. In this article, we formulate a multi-criteria optimization model for supporting strategic supply chain network design decisions. The modelconsiders disruption riskofsupply chain components (i.e., facilities andtransportation links)as well as profit and customer responsiveness as conflicting criteria. This consideration is important since disruption at any supply chain component may lead to the disruption of the entire supply chain network. We apply goal programming (GP) techniques to handle multiple and conflicting network design objectives. We also present a numerical example to illustrate how to incorporate disruption risk when making strategic supply chain decisions. The results demonstrate how supply chain network designs that over emphasize profit may include inexpensive supply chain components with high disruption risk. Therefore, more attention must be paid to managing potential disruptions and designing supply chain networks that balance profit and risk.

Strategic network planning activities of national and even more of multinational companies are recently influenced by an increasing number of laws and regulations regarding environmental issues. On top of that non-governmental bodies pose additional pressures on companies to comply with environmental as well as social standards. Therefore, this paper presents a multi-objective and robust optimization-based closed-loop supply chain design model. In the objective function both expected total costs as well as carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) are to be minimized. Customer demands and used-product return ratio are considered to be uncertain.

714,"The capacitated multi-facility location problem is a complex and imprecise decision-making problem which contains both quantitative and qualitative factors. In the literature, many objectives for optimizing many types of logistics networks are described: (i) minimization objectives such as cost, inventory, transportation time, environmental impact, financial risk and (ii) maximization objectives such as profit, customer satisfaction, and flexibility and robustness. However, only a few papers have considered quantitative and qualitative factors together with imprecise methodologies. Unlike traditional cost-based optimization techniques, the approach proposed here evaluates these factors together while considering various viewpoints. Decision-makers must deal both factors together to model complex structure of real-world applications. In this paper, a two-phase possibilistic linear programming approach and a fuzzy analytical hierarchical process approach have been combined to optimize two objective functions (""minimum cost"" and ""maximum qualitative factors benefit"") in a four-stage (suppliers, plants, distribution centers, customers) supply chain network in the presence of vagueness.

715,"This article contributes to distribution system literature on three inter-linked aspects viz. formulation of a novel integrated low-carbon/green distribution system for the demand side of a Supply Chain (SC) with a single product and multiple consumers, i.e. drop-off points, a novel and robust solution approach through a Design of Experiment (DoE)-guided Multiple-Objective Particle Swarm Optimisation (MOPSO) optimiser and exhaustive analysis of the solutions (i.e. prioritisation, ranking and scenario analysis). The total costs, CO2 emission and the traversed distances of the vehicles during transportation are optimised. The optimisation model for the strategic decision-making is formulated by effectively integrating the 0-1 mixed-integer programming with a green constraint based on Analytic Hierarchy Process. Due to the computationally NP-hard characteristic of the model, a systematic and technically robust DoE-guided solution approach is designed using a commercial solver - modeFRONTIER®. DoE guides the solution through the MOPSO optimiser in order to eliminate the un-realistic set of feasible and optimal solution sets. A popular multi-attribute decision-making approach, TOPSIS, evaluates the solutions found from the Pareto optimal solution space of the solver. Finally, decision-makers preferences are analysed for monitoring the changes in the controlling parameters with respect to the changes in the decisions. A scenario analysis of the events by considering alternative possible outcomes is also conducted. It is found that the implemented methodology successfully routes the vehicles with optimal costs and low-carbon emission thus contributing to greening the environment on the demand side of a SC network. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",10.1080/00207543.2013.864054,International Journal of Production Research,Low-carbon | Multi-objective distribution system | Particle swarm optimisation | Single product | Transportation | Two-layer supply chain network,84897115105,Integrated low-carbon distribution system for the demand side of a product distribution supply chain: A DoE-guided MOPSO optimiser-based solution approach,2014.0
716,"Purpose: Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) account for 99 % of companies operating in the European food and drink industry and, often, are part of highly fragmented and complex food chains. The article focuses on the development of a social impact assessment methodology for SMEs in selected food and drink products as part of the EU-FP7 SENSE research project. The proposed methodology employs a top-down and bottom-up approach and focuses on labour rights/working conditions along the product supply chain as the key social impact indicator, limiting key stakeholder classification to workers/employees and local communities impacted by the production process. Problems related to this emerging field are discussed, and questions for further research are expounded. Methods: The article reviews both academic and 'grey' literature on life cycle assessment (LCA) and its relationship to social LCA (S-LCA) and SMEs at the beginning of 2013 and includes case study evidence from the food sector. A pilot questionnaire survey sent to European food and drink sector SMEs and trade associations (as partners in the research project) about their knowledge, experience and engagement with social impacts is presented. Proposals are elaborated for a social impact assessment methodology that identifies the key data for SMEs to collect. Results and discussion: The literature reveals the complexity of the S-LCA approach as it aims to unite disparate and often conflicting interests. Findings from the pilot questionnaire are discussed. Using a top-down and bottom-up approach, the proposed methodology assesses data from SMEs along the supply chain in order to gauge social improvements in the management of labour-related issues for different product sectors. Issues relating to the 'attributional' choice of a social impact indicator and key stakeholder categories are discussed. How 'scoring' is interpreted and reported and what the intended effect of its use will be are also elaborated upon. Conclusions: Whilst recognising the difficulty of devising a robust social impact assessment for SMEs in the food and drink sector, it is argued that the proposed methodology makes a useful contribution in this fast-emerging field. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",10.1007/s11367-013-0691-0,International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,Europe | Food and drink sector | Life cycle assessment | Methodologies | S-LCA | SMEs | Social impacts,84899060427,Social impacts and life cycle assessment: Proposals for methodological development for SMEs in the European food and drink sector,2014.0

720,"Increasing effort is being made to build security into software-but with mixed results. The need for security apparently exceeds the ability and will of software engineers to design secure software architectures, implement secure coding methods, perform functional security testing, and carefully manage the installation of software products on various platforms and in different environments. COTS/GOTS software often harbors numerous vulnerabilities (we will call such software ""weakware"") and such software occasionally contains ""malware"" (malicious software). The main difference between weakware and malware is that the weaknesses of the former are mostly unintentional or accidental, whereas the damaging characteristics of the latter are planned and intentional and usually require some measure of technical expertise to implement effectively. Nevertheless, from the security perspective the potential consequences are undesirable and damaging irrespective of how the weak or bad code got into the program in the first place. In this article, we examine how and where such damaging code or programs might be introduced throughout the software supply chain lifecycle and how such weakware and malware might be avoided, deterred, eliminated or mitigated.",,CrossTalk,,84900608959,"Malware, ""weakware,"" and the security of software supply chains",2014.0

The decision problem is developed for the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) industry, which currently ranks among the ten largest CO2 emitting industries worldwide. In this paper, the evaluation and selection of the most suitable supplier is performed using the analytic network process (ANP), a decision-making technique that allows practitioners to solve complex decision structures. The key contributions of the present paper reside in the combination of literature and case-based derived decision criteria, aimed at enhancing judgment validity, with particular emphasis on a collaborative setting, which is highly relevant in the present context as the focal firms often lack the necessary skills for sustainability and, at the same time, are responsible for sustainability in the supply chain.

The model is designed to determine and optimize large-scale container flows from US trade partners to inland markets mainly located within the lower 48 states. The dynamic traffic assignment for the freight flow considers several factors such as congestion, volume/capacity (V/C) ratio, throughput and distance-based impedance and the Geographic Information Systems platform provides a visualization environment for all feasible routes. Visual analytics with the resultant geographical distribution maps indicate that maritime containers are concentrated on the West Coast whereas rail shipments are densely concentrated along rail transshipment points such as Chicago, Memphis and Dallas. The highway transportation densities are mainly visible with origins from marine ports to associated market destinations starting from hinterland and radiating further away from these primal areas to other inland intermodal terminals that serve major landlocked metropolitan cities that are not served by railway networks.

724,"Geographers broadly, and political ecologists in particular, have been at the forefront of analyzing the progressive linking of Northern consumption practices with livelihoods elsewhere, problematizing the devolution that places 'citizen-consumers', NGOs, and corporate actors as key political agents of protecting workers and environments, promoting 'ethical' trade, and 'greening' economies through their purchasing choices. Utilizing empirical work on the development of certification and labeling schemes designed to ensure the safe recycling of used electronics, or e-wastes, across a global supply chain, this paper extends lessons learned from these critical analyses of consumer politics to ongoing debates about e-waste, trade, and recycling. I highlight the ambiguities and democratic deficits that emerge from promoting global environmental justice politics through market-driven disposal choices. I analyze the practices of representation through which NGOs and institutions produce e-waste as an object of regulation/commodification that is amenable to consumer action and argue that there is a disconnect between the abstractions necessary to sell 'ethical' e-waste recycling and the nuances of place-specific recycling practices. Like other fair trade schemes, certifications for ethical electronics recyclers rely upon narratives, such as environmental justice, that construct the e-waste problem in ways that render it governable, or 'legible' in Scott's sense. However, given the complexity of global commodity-networks like those for used electronics, these governing narratives rely on abstractions that oversimplify and rework the fetish of what e-waste is, where it goes, and how it should be managed.

Following large-scale and catastrophic disasters, local organisations integrate with other responding organisations to form hastily disaster relief supply chain networks. Such supply networks are infrequently activated in a single location, generate unparalleled uncertainty, change quickly, and are driven by the urgency of saving lives and restoring livelihoods. Unfortunately, even where sound supply chain management practices are used, supply networks have encountered diverse levels of resilience and adequate disaster relief performance has remained elusive. In this paper, several unique characteristics that disaster relief efforts exhibit are examined as compared with demand-driven, steady-state supply chains. Important differences in the flows of resource, money, and information are identified. A complex adaptive supply network (CASN) lens is used to frame what existing literature has uncovered regarding disaster relief efforts, showing how relief organisations, their interactions, and their environmental context help determine the level of resilience that supply networks experience following disasters. This CASN characterisation is leveraged to help explain why traditional supply chain management practices lead to varied results in disaster relief.

730,"© 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Sustainable supply chain network design is a rich area for academic research that is still in its infancy and has potential to affect supply chain performance. Increasing regulations for carbon and waste management are forcing firms to consider their supply chains from ecological and social objectives, but in reality, however, facilities and the links connecting them are disrupted from time to time, due to poor weather, natural or manmade disasters or a combination of any other factors. Supply chain systems drop their sustainability objectives while coping with these unexpected disruptions. Hence, the new challenges for supply chain managers are to design an efficient and effective supply chain network that will be resilient enough to bounce back from any disruption and that also should have sufficient vigilance to offer same sustainability under a disruption state. This paper focuses on ecological sustainability, because an environmental focus in a supply chain system is more important and also links with other pillars of sustainability, as the products need to be produced, packed and transported in an ethical way, which should not harm social balance and the environment. Owing to importance of the considered issue, this paper attempts to introduce a network optimization model for a sustainable and resilient supply chain network by incorporating (1) sustainability via carbon emissions and embodied carbon footprints and (2) resilience by incorporating location-specific risks.

This paper studies biomass transportation, storage and change of properties (moisture content and hence dry matter, energy density and bulk density) through the use of different pre-treatments: (i) torrefaction, (ii) torrefaction combined with pelletization, (iii) pelletization, (iv) fast pyrolysis and (v) fast pyrolysis combined with char grinding, which produce a range of very different pre-treated biomass. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) that evaluates the net present value and the environmental impact through a life cycle assessment (LCA). The results propose location-allocation decision together with the selection/capacity of pre-treatment technologies for each scenario. The scenarios contemplate different biomass characteristics, availability and distribution for a supply chain case study located in Spain: forest and agricultural woody residues used to replace at least 10% of the total thermal inlet power provided by coal in the existing network of thermal plants. © 2014 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.",10.1016/j.cherd.2014.01.004,Chemical Engineering Research and Design,Biomass seasonality | Biomass supply chain | Biomass waste | Co-combustion | Multi-objective MILP | Superstructure of pre-treatments,84905089542,Optimization of pre-treatment selection for the use of woody waste in co-combustion plants,2014.0

This paper presents a multi-stage multi-product robust optimization model for responsive supply chain network design (SCND) under operational and disruption risks. First, a deterministic mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed considering different transportation modes, outsourcing, flexibility and cross-docking options. Then, the robust counterpart of the presented model is developed to deal with the inherent uncertainty of input parameters.

733,"The paper aims to illustrate the use of fuzzy data envelopment analysis (DEA) in analyzing reverse supply chain (RSC) performance from the manufacturer's perspective. By using an alternative α-cut approach, the fuzzy DEA model was converted into a crisp linear programming problem, thereby altering the problem to an interval programming one. The model is able to obtain precise and robust efficiency values. An investigation was also made between the obtained efficiency scores and certain relevant background information of the companies. The study revealed that while ISO 14001 certification usually ensures an environmentally friendly supply chain network, companies which have implemented RSC techniques since a longer duration do not necessarily have a more efficient supply chain in general. © 2014 Manasvi Kumar et al.",10.1155/2014/901914,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,,84904656852,Evaluating reverse supply chain efficiency: Manufacturer's perspective,2014.0
734,"Globalisation, along with rapid demographic changes and evolving regulatory and legislative interventions, dictates the increasing demand for high quality, value-added and customised agrifood products. In this context, the design, development and operation of efficient agrifood supply chains (AFSCs) have begun to be met with increased interest in modern management science. Furthermore, the volatility of weather conditions, the perishability of goods, the complex food safety regulatory environment, the changing consumers' lifestyle trends, the environmental concerns and the plethora of stakeholders involved pose significant challenges towards the development of robust supply chains within the agrifood sector.In this manuscript, we provide a comprehensive hierarchical decision-making framework and a critical taxonomy that apply to all stakeholders involved in the design and management of AFSCs. More specifically, we first present the generic system components along with the unique characteristics of AFSCs that differentiate them from conventional supply chain networks. We then recognise the natural hierarchy of the decision-making process for the design and planning of AFSCs and provide a taxonomy of existing research efforts as these are mapped on the relevant strategic, tactical and operational levels of the hierarchical decision-making echelons. Our critical analysis demonstrates that the agrifood supply chain management is a rapidly evolving research field, focussing more on addressing case-dependent problems related with distinct supply chain echelons, and less on developing integrated methodological approaches for the optimisation of the entire supply chain. Our analysis further allows for the identification of gaps and overlaps in literature, as well as of future research areas. © 2013 IAgrE.",10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2013.10.014,Biosystems Engineering,,84896546056,Agrifood supply chain management: A comprehensive hierarchical decision-making framework and a critical taxonomy,2014.0

In this research, we address the application of fuzzy sets to design a multi-product, multi-period, closed-loop supply chain network. The presented supply chain includes three objective functions: maximization of profit, minimization of delivery time, and maximization of quality. In the context of fuzzy mathematical programming, the paper jointly considers fuzzy/flexible constraints for fuzziness, fuzzy coefficients for lack of knowledge, and fuzzy goal of decision maker(s). According to fuzzy components considered, a fuzzy optimization approach is adopted to convert the proposed fuzzy multi-objective mixed-integer linear program into an equivalent auxiliary crisp model to obtain the relevant solutions.

In a green supply chain, designing the network of the reverse chain is vital. Thus, the robust configuration of reverse chain will cause acting friendly with the environment and brings a huge benefit for the partners of the supply chain. Hence, it can be used as competitive competency. Three objectives are considered to minimise recycling cost, rate of waste generated by recyclers and material recovery time in such a way that the best set of recyclers to allocate products is determined.

737,"Research on supply chain network design has mainly pursued efficiency oriented objectives for boosting service level and profit. However, the priority of an enterprise facing bankruptcy pressure shifts to fulfill debt obligation with limited financial resources and survive downsizing. In this paper, we define a supply chain downsizing problem (SCDP) under bankruptcy as streamlining a supply chain network in order to balance a business survival and its long term profitability. We formulate a mixed integer programming (MIP) model with specific downsizing features, which maximizes the utilization of investment resources through a combined operation of demand selection and production assets reallocation. The corresponding robust counterparts of the MIP model are further developed based on robust optimization techniques for dealing with uncertainties of demands and exchange rates. We analyze and validate the proposed downsizing MIP model with a series of systematically generated test cases while its robust counterparts are studied extensively using a large generated case. The findings demonstrate the value of our approach in discovering detailed downsizing plans in magnitude and direction and provide valuable insight into how financial debt payback could be arranged, and in a unique way show managers how the reconfigured downsized network would mitigate and lead to a sustainable and higher economic value supply chain. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.ijpe.2014.04.004,International Journal of Production Economics,Bankruptcy | Downsizing | Robust optimization | Supply chain | Uncertain demand | Uncertain exchange rate,84901708304,Supply chain downsizing under bankruptcy: A robust optimization approach,2014.0
738,"Increasing environmental, legislative, and social concerns are forcing companies to take a fresh view of the impact of supply chain operations on environment and society when designing a sustainable supply chain. A challenging task in today's food industry is distributing high quality perishable foods throughout the food supply chain. This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization model by integrating sustainability in decision-making, on distribution in a perishable food supply chain network (SCN). It introduces a two-echelon location-routing problem with time-windows (2E-LRPTW) for sustainable SCN design and optimizing economical and environmental objectives in a perishable food SCN. The goal of 2E-LRPTW is to determine the number and location facilities and to optimize the amount of products delivered to lower stages and routes at each level. It also aims to reduce costs caused by carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions throughout the network. The proposed method includes a novel multi-objective hybrid approach called MHPV, a hybrid of two known multi-objective algorithms: namely, multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and adapted multi-objective variable neighborhood search (AMOVNS). MHPV features two strategies for leader selection procedures (LSP), (i.e. Grids) and crowding distance is compared to common genetic algorithms based on metaheuristics (i.e. MOGA, NRGA and NSGA-II). Results indicate that the hybrid approach achieves better solutions compared to others, and that crowding distance method for LSP outperforms the former Grids method. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.ijpe.2013.12.028,International Journal of Production Economics,Food supply chain | Greenhouse gases emissions | Perishable foods | Robust multi-objective metaheuristic | Sustainability | Sustainable supply chain design | Two-echelon location-routing problem,84899922920,Two-echelon multiple-vehicle location-routing problem with time windows for optimization of sustainable supply chain network of perishable food,2014.0

Pallets are the most common unit-load platform used across the world and allow for efficient and seamless handling, storage, and transportation of goods. Every year, 500 million new pallets are manufactured and become part of the large pool (roughly 2 billion) of pallets that are in circulation in the United States. Wood remains the most common pallet material, accounting for more than 90 percent of the inventory and applications worldwide. As companies strive to become more sustainable, a thorough understanding of the environmental impacts of every aspect of their logistics operations becomes critical. Among the many factors affecting the life cycle of wood pallets are the pallet structural design, logistics management approach, and service environment conditions. This work is the result of a comprehensive 2-year study on the operations and practices that take place during a wood pallet life cycle. In this article, a prescribed approach for estimating the carbon footprint, or greenhouse gas emissions, that arise across all phases of a pallet life cycle, is presented.

742,"The food industry and its supply chains have significant sustainability implications. Effective supply chain management requires careful consideration of multiple tiers of partners, especially with respect to sustainability issues. Firms increasingly approach their sub-suppliers to drive compliance with social and environmental efforts. A number of complexities and unique challenges make sub-supplier management more difficult than direct supplier management, e.g. a lack of contractual relationships to sub-suppliers, few opportunities to put direct pressure on sub-suppliers, or lack of transparency concerning sub-suppliers' involvement in a focal firm's supply chains. The literature has not investigated, either from sustainability or other perspectives, the critical success factors (CSFs) for firms' sub-supplier management. Therefore, this study seeks to explore and increase understanding of critical factors that help to overcome the complexities and unique challenges of sub-supplier management, with a focus on the food industry. Using data and information from a year-long field study in two food supply chains, the research identified 14 CSFs that influence the success of sub-suppliers' compliance with corporate sustainability standards (CSS). The identified CSFs can be classified into (1) focal firm-related, (2) relationship-related, (3) supply chain partner-related, and (4) context-related CSFs. The present research expands on the theory of critical success factors by applying the theory to the sustainability and sub-supplier management context. In support of critical success theory, it was found that CSFs do exist and their management will be necessary for effective sub-supplier management success as highlighted and exemplified by field study insights from practitioners.

743,"Sustainable supply chain management is a topical area which is continuing to grow and evolve. Within supply chains, downstream distribution from producers to customers plays a significant role in the environmental performance of production supply chains. With consumer consciousness growing in the area of sustainable food supply, food distribution needs to embrace and adapt to improve its environmental performance, while still remaining economically competitive. With a particular focus on the dairy industry, a robust solution approach is presented for the design of a capacitated distribution network for a two-layer supply chain involved in the distribution of milk in Ireland. In particular the green multi-objective optimisation model minimises CO2 emissions from transportation and total costs in the distribution chain. These distribution channels are analysed to ensure the non-dominated solutions are distributed along the Pareto fronts. A multi-attribute decision-making approach, TOPSIS, has been used to rank the realistic feasible transportation routes resulting from the trade-offs between total costs and CO2 emissions. The refined realistic solution space allows the decision-makers to geographically locate the sustainable transportation routes. In addition to geographical mapping the decision maker is also presented with a number of alternative analysed scenarios which forcibly open closed distribution routes to build resiliency into the solution approach. In terms of model performance, three separate GA based optimisers have been evaluated and reported upon.

744,"Post-seismic inventory and logistics planning under incomplete and fuzzy information is an important yet understudied area in supply chain risk management. The goal of this paper is to propose a system dynamics model to analyze the behaviors of disrupted disaster relief supply chain by simulating the uncertainties associated with predicting post-seismic road network and delayed information. The simulation results indicate: (1) information delay has different influences over the relief head-quarter (the upstream) and the disaster-affected areas (the downstream); and (2) the change of road conditions and shipment schedules have impact on the on-time transportation rate in supply chain management. Furthermore, this paper defined and tested supplies' replenishment solutions combined with three inventory planning strategies and four forecasting methods under different lead time uncertainties. The results show that: (1) a strategy that considers information from both the post-seismic management center and the affected areas can provide a better logistic plan than an one takes information from one side; (2) the smooth-the-trend forecasting method is suitable for inventory and logistic planning when the post-seismic situations are volatile, while the quick-response forecasting method has good performance in stable environments.

746,"Fuels from biomass resources have emerged as a promising alternative to fossil fuel. Widely distributed source locations, varying feedstock, and specific regional conditions make it challenging to develop an optimization model that can be applied to any region to estimate the overall economics of producing these biofuels. The lack of a region specific, flexible optimization model makes it difficult for stakeholders like local policy makers, growers, and investors to make informed decisions about the economic viability and social and environmental impacts of biomass utilization. This novel contribution will illustrate an approach to develop a region specific optimization model which links various aspects of the biofuel supply chain such as feedstock source location, upstream and downstream logistics, as well as thermochemical and biochemical processing. This research shows how various individual optimization models can be combined, resulting in a complete, multivariable economic optimization model for a regional biomass network, paving a pathway for future work to develop an integrated framework for sustainability. The research demonstrated in this contribution illustrates the development of a model that can form the basis of a generalizable decision support tool that can guide investors and policy makers in making critical assessments on a local level in any particular region of interest.

747,"Concern related to green and sustainability is growing from past few years in the research area of supply chain management. Collectively, these concerns involves a higher number of interacting factors, which further can multiply complexity by the decrease in visibility of the risks in supply chain operations and so add to its vulnerability. To make supply chain (SC) capable to bear simultaneously regular and risk condition, one requires proactive planning and flexibility in the decisions making. To provide supply chain designers a proactive decision model, this paper proposes to use a flexible decision approach, i.e. Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) for recognizing the combined interactions between factors influencing sustainable risk bearing SC. However, the interpretation of the interactive relationships represented by directed links for the identified factors relatively lacks in the ISM approach, and thus may distort the process of decision making. Therefore, in this study, ISM is extended to the Total Interpretive Structural Modeling (TISM) approach to overcome these issues in interpreting the directed links in the structural model for considered factors. Further, by using relationship analysis, we graphically categorize factors on the basis of their impact on performance. Finally, TISM based the proposed model evaluates the causality and illustrate factors with interpretation of relations via directed links in the form of Interpretive Matrix, and suggests that factors at the bottom level are crucial for sustainability focused chain to build its capability on risks and risk issues. The implications at managerial level and conclusions are presented in the end. © Global Institute of Flexible Systems Management 2013.",10.1007/s40171-014-0059-8,Global Journal of Flexible Systems Management,Flexibility | Green | Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) | Performance improvement | Risk | Supply chain | Sustainability | Total Interpretive Structural Modeling (TISM),84905749571,Flexible decision approach for analysing performance of sustainable supply chains under risks/uncertainty,2014.0
748,"One approach to use solar radiation more effectively in solar cells is to stack, in series, multiple photoactive layers with complementary absorption spectra. Such devices are often termed tandem or multi-junction solar cells. The larger number of different materials and processing steps involved in their making when compared with the single junction solar cell has to be justified and compensated by a higher efficiency. A central question to ask is how much energy you need to invest in a system in order for it to produce energy and return the investment at least once and preferably a number of times. As an initial investigation into the potential viability of the tandem or multi-junction approach we have engaged in a detailed analysis based on the manufacturing energy for each step within the tandem module supply chain for full ambient processing of thin flexible polymer tandem solar cells prepared entirely by roll processing methods. We present a comprehensive overview of relevant research results on how the energy consumption affects the energy balance when using single and multi-junction solar cells. Based on the above question we calculate the minimum efficiency that the tandem or multi-junction should present to determine the minimum energy payback time; that is whether (or when) the increase in materials use and complexity of the tandem architecture is compensated by better performance. After analysing the performance and the consideration of a series of technical improvement opportunities, we project that the tandem solar cell has to be ~20% higher performing than the corresponding single junction solar cell to be warranted. We also highlight that there is a range in the reciprocal EBPT-efficiency relationship where the tandem solar cell is an advantage. Specific to polymer and organic solar cells are however that they embody very little energy and this implies that the single junction may be an advantage, especially in cases where land mass is not critical. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.solmat.2013.09.013,Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells,Energy payback time | Life-cycle assessment | Multi-junction solar cells | Organic photovoltaics | Roll-to-roll | Tandem solar cells,84889092020,Life cycle analysis of organic tandem solar cells: When are they warranted?,2014.0
749,"Supply chain network (SCN) modeling has gain a great research interest as companies realized that scientific approaches in managing their SCN's, rather than ""common-sense"" heuristics, are the roads to achieve sustainability, profitability, growth, and competiveness. Ever since, the relevant literature is supplied with models that aim to optimize SCN's design and/or operation. The former is a strategic process that designs network's infrastructure and concerns long term investments which undertake huge amounts of capitals. SCN managers should be able to evaluate how these decisions contribute to the overall performance of the company and not assess them with only cost oriented indicators. By employing advance financial management methods, such as sale and leaseback (SLB), fixed assets could be the medium to improve liquidity and strengthen credit solvency. This paper aims to enrich the SCN design literature by introducing a Mixed-Integer Non Linear Programming (MINLP) model that integrates SLB technique with SCN design decisions. By exploiting the properties of the MINLP model it is reformulated into an exact Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that is solved to global optimality. A real case study from a consumer goods company is utilized in order to show model's functionality and to evaluate its adaptability, robustness, and benefit.

754,"© 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. Previous research describes supplier integration as a competitive resource that manufacturers use to create economic rents. Considering the mixed results obtained from linking supplier integration with performance outcomes, a 'dynamic' component - or the ability to reconfigure the supply chain to adapt to changing environments - appears critical to creating a sustainable competitive advantage. This study identifies integration sensing, seizing and transforming as sub-capabilities that together form a dynamic capability, referred to herein as supplier integrative capability (SIC). That is, SIC enables buyers to sense changes in the supply environment by sharing information with suppliers, seize opportunities presented by establishing procedures to analyse this information and make long-term changes to existing processes. A global sample from the industrial sector reveals that the three capabilities exhibit complementarity and must exist simultaneously for the capability to be effective, which then enhances both process flexibility and cost efficiency and helps firms avoid the traditional trade-off of cost and flexibility. In addition, market and technological dynamics strengthen the effect of SIC on operational performance; supply base complexity attenuates this link.",10.1016/j.jom.2014.09.004,Journal of Operations Management,Buyer-supplier integration | Dynamic capability | Dynamics | Operational performance | Supply base complexity,84911908399,Developing supplier integration capabilities for sustainable competitive advantage: A dynamic capabilities approach,2014.0

Evaluation of the quality of natural waters used as sources for drinking water supply is very important for selection of the proper technological treatment system that would ensure the compliance of physical, chemical and microbiological parameters with the specific standards. The current study aims at investigating the quality of two natural waters used as sources for drinking water supply of Iasi City: Prut River (surface water) and Timisesti (groundwater). The experimental analysis of the water quality was performed by daily sampling and analysis of four of the main quality indicators that are critical for disinfection: temperature, pH value, turbidity and oxidability for both sources. Evaluation of monthly, seasonal and yearly averages and variations also has been accomplished. Based on the results of this study conducted for a period of almost five years (January 2009 – November 2013) it was found that the main quality indicators for the two natural water sources comply with the Romanian technical norm. The comparison of the average values of the analyzed parameters for the period 2009 – 2013 reveals a better quality of the Timisesti source that would require only a simple physical treatment followed by chlorination. Prut River water source, however, requires a physical and chemical treatment followed by disinfection through chlorination before being distributed to the water supply network of Iasi City.",10.30638/eemj.2014.257,Environmental Engineering and Management Journal,Drinking water supply | Oxidability | Prut | Sustainable development | Timisesti | Turbidity,84932651555,"Study on the quality of water supply sources for Iasi City, Romania",2014.0
756,"Effective production planning of manufacturing networks requires careful consideration of several factors, including capacity, production, yields, and resource failure costs. This is particularly critical in highly variable environments where multiple resource types are available during the planning and implementation processes. This paper presents a model to aid the decision makers to determine what production resources to select, and the amount of production to allocate to each resource in order to minimise the total costs. The model considers costs associated with the production resources and customer related costs such as late delivery and loss due to undelivered units. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to examine the robustness of the optimal solution with respect to late delivery costs and loss costs. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the model by providing insights into the interactions among the cost and resource variables. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",10.1504/IJAMS.2014.060889,International Journal of Applied Management Science,Manufacturing networks | Risk modelling | Supply chain management | Yield modelling,84899818238,"Production planning of parallel resources considering yields, failures and production costs",2014.0
757,"Single-use systems (also referred to as disposables) have become a huge part of the bioprocessing industry, which raised concern in the industry regarding quality and security of supply. Processes must be in place to assure the supply and control of outsourced activities and quality of purchased materials along the product life cycle. Quality and security of supply for single-use bioreactors (SUBs) are based on a multidisciplinary approach. Developing a state-of-the-art SUB-system based on quality by design (QbD) principles requires broad expertise and know-how including the cell culture application, polymer chemistry, regulatory requirements, and a deep understanding of the biopharmaceutical industry. Using standardized products reduces the complexity and strengthens the robustness of the supply chain. Well-established supplier relations including risk mitigation strategies are the basis for achieving long-term security of supply. Well-developed quality systems including change control approaches aligned with the requirements of the biopharmaceutical industry are a key factor in supporting long-term product availability.

758,"Railway transportation plays an important role in many disaster relief and other emergency supply chains. Based on the analysis of several recent disaster rescue operations in China, the paper proposes a mathematical model for emergency railway wagon scheduling, which considers multiple target stations requiring relief supplies, source stations for providing supplies, and central stations for allocating railway wagons. Under the emergency environment, the aim of the problem is to minimize the weighted time for delivering all the required supplies to the targets. For efficiently solving the problem, we develop a new hybrid biogeography-based optimization (BBO) algorithm, which uses a local ring topology of population to avoid premature convergence, includes the differential evolution (DE) mutation operator to perform effective exploration, and takes some problem-specific mechanisms for fine-tuning the search process and handling the constraints. Computational experiments show that our algorithm is robust and scalable, and outperforms some state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms on a set of problem instances. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.cor.2013.09.002,Computers and Operations Research,Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) | Differential evolution (DE) | Emergency relief supply | Railway wagon scheduling | Ring topology,84884611857,Emergency railway wagon scheduling by hybrid biogeography-based optimization,2014.0

In case of lack of preparedness and preventive and predictive programs and suitable staff training, any potential damage to these facilities may result in crisis and have adverse health, political and social impacts. Water transfer and distribution systems are one of the main elements in water supply facilities which are subject to qualitative and quantitative risks resulting from dangers and natural threats (earthquake and floods) as well as man-made risks (e.g. unstable flow, corrosion, high pressure, executive operation, etc.).Accidents in water supply networks especially water transmission lines annually create considerable damage for organizations. Negligence to potential dangers and determining vulnerability and risk in design, utilization and maintenance stages of facilities may create irreversible costs for operation of the water utilities, side facilities and the environment.

760,"© 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. Global environmental changes have led to frequent occurrences of climatic extremes. The increasingly frequent and high-magnitude natural disasters in Taiwan have caused significant mortality, injury, and property damage. In response, there have been requests to improve the capacity to cope with extreme climatic conditions through increased awareness and identification of vulnerability. Disruptions to transportation systems affect the resilience for sustaining daily operations. Among the various types of transportation systems, ports provide substantial employment and industrial activity, contributing to national and regional development. In addition, ports integrate the functions of supply chains such as services in logistics, information, and business, becoming the location of industrial clusters. Therefore, this study examines the risk of port failures from the perspective of vulnerability. Specifically, seven vulnerable factors derived from the extant literature and lessons learned from the previous disaster cases are evaluated using geographic information systems. The results reveal that port capacity and efficiency have a significant effect on port vulnerability in which the efficiency of gantry cranes, labor productivity, free trade zone business volume, and ground access networks play crucial roles in port failure. Moreover, the risks associated with port operation are evaluated by overlapping a hazard map of areas prone to debris flows and tsunami inundation. The risk maps can assist decision makers in understanding the vulnerability and adopting appropriate strategies to minimize disaster risks.",10.1007/s11069-014-1214-4,Natural Hazards,Disaster risk assessment | Geographic information system (GIS) | Hazard map | Port vulnerability,84939883254,Disaster risk assessment of ports based on the perspective of vulnerability,2014.0

Such a measure is needed to quantify the scale of impact and identify the root causes of disruptions. Design/methodology/approach-In order to develop this measure, an inductive approach was adopted, using four primary case studies to test the measure in an industrial environment. The case studies are from the fast moving consumer goods sector with primary and secondary distribution networks included. The “Extra Distance” measure has been evaluated against established generic criteria that define the quality of any performance measure. Findings-The research indicates good compliance with the criteria used to evaluate the “Extra Distance” measure. The measure is also found to be useful for practitioners who are able to directly relate the measure to their distribution network operations. Research limitations/implications-Further research should see the “Extra Distance” measure further tested in other freight transport operations and industrial sectors. Practical implications-The measure is directly related to a number of causes of uncertainty which helps freight transport managers to quickly identify potential solutions. The “Extra Distance” measure can be used to quantify the effects of disruptions which can occur in road freight transport networks generate unnecessary cost within distribution networks, potentially eroding profit margins which are known to be very low in the road freight transport industry.

762,"As Indonesia heads to the polls in 2014, its economy is slowing. The end of the commodities boom and the global return to more normal monetary policy has exposed some weaknesses. Exchange-rate depreciation has absorbed some of the adjustment; but structural rigidities are still likely to limit the expansion of non-commodity sectors, and the increased fuel-subsidy bill for imported oil is putting pressure on the current account and the budget. The immediate focus is on demand-side consolidation to manage inflation and the currentaccount deficit.For an economy like Indonesia's to be overheating, and for monetary and fiscal authorities to be engineering a soft landing, when growth is below 6%, points to major structural problems. If Indonesia is to prevent the current rate of growth from becoming the new normal, there will need to be a substantial supply-side response to lift productivity, as well as a restructuring of the economy and the introduction of policies that make the economy more flexible in adjusting to shocks. The current economic slowdown has yet to trigger sweeping reforms; policy coordination remains problematic as Indonesia enters a big political year.Compared with its neighbours, Indonesia is largely on the outside of the regional production networks, and its manufacturing sector does not play into factory Asia. Now, faced with lower commodity prices globally-and growth in non-resource sectors is critical- the lack of a large manufacturing base appears to be a weakness. Indonesia is attracting more foreign direct investment than ever and is climbing the global rankings of preferred economies in which to invest, but this is occurring without improvements to its investment environment or competitiveness. Indonesia can participate more fully in global supply chains and increase its potential for growth by upgrading its infrastructure, improving its investment environment, and using regional initiatives strategically to make strong commitments that reinforce its priorities for domestic reform.In its hosting of APEC in 2013, Indonesia championed infrastructure investment where the lack of structural reform and macroeconomic constraints are inhibiting much-needed expansion, both in Indonesia and in the region. The positive outcome, albeit only a small step forward for the Doha Round, at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Bali, in December, also builds momentum for better regional and global cooperation.

763,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate why developing country suppliers are adopting socially sustainable practices and how the implementation process is both impeded and enabled. Design/methodology/approach: A multi-case study approach is adopted based on four ready made garment (RMG) industry suppliers in Bangladesh and the Bangladeshi buying houses of two large UK retailers. The primary mode of data collection is exploratory face-to-face interviews with 14 senior representatives. Findings are later interpreted using the transaction cost economics (TCE) theory lens. Findings: One factor motivating implementation is labour retention - a skilled labour shortage means employees will migrate to other factories if suppliers do not improve certain social standards. Barriers to implementation include a misalignment between the requirements of western codes of conduct and the cultural and socio-economic context in Bangladesh. Enablers include a shift from auditing and monitoring to more open dialogue and trust between buyers and suppliers. The paper also reveals evidence of mock compliance, e.g. suppliers keeping two sets of timesheets, and of the complexities of social sustainability. For example, while some initiatives are unanimously positive, removing child labour from RMG industry suppliers has simply diverted it to other, less regulated and more hazardous industries such as construction. Research limitations/implications: An early, exploratory contribution is provided. The work could be extended, e.g. to other stakeholders such as third-party auditors and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). Practical implications: Being aware of the motivations, barriers and enablers will help multi-national corporations (MNCs) promote good practice and anticipate the challenges they are likely to face in improving the social sustainability of their supply chains. Use of TCE leads to suggesting MNCs need to move beyond immediate suppliers and incorporate tier-two suppliers in implementation efforts. Social implications: Social sustainability improvements should benefit vulnerable workers, help suppliers develop longer term relationships with MNCs, and contribute to economic growth.

764,"This study aims at highlighting the use of upstream supply chain in Rapid Productization (RP) by analyzing upstream supply chain practices in small firms. RP is a process of quickly supplementing a company's product or service offering to meet unexpected customer needs. A well-managed upstream supply chain network is a critical facilitator of RP for a small business. Selection of an upstream supplier during an RP process escalates the level of risk in fulfilling customer's needs. To avoid the mistakes resulting from the selection of the supplier, the company should use a smaller variety of suppliers and choose products that the suppliers know they can fulfill. Due to the nature of RP use, established supplier network resources are recommended. We also find evidence that a company's performance is positively associated with the use of RP.

The responsibility of producers to extend and reverse SCs is a critical and timely topic that captures increasing concerns over the way firms can adapt their business models to interlinking technical, socio-economic and environmental frameworks. This is particularly true when producers are not also reuse/recycle actors. By performing a critical review of the scientific literature on this field, this article develops nine elemental factors that can be considered for assessing the impacts of collaborative strategies as a means to implement extended producer responsibility (EPR) in open-loop SCs.

767,"Purpose: In the context of progress of sustainability science, life cycle thinking and, in particular, life cycle sustainability assessment may play a crucial role. Environmental, economic and social implications of the whole supply chain of products, both goods and services, their use and waste management, i.e. their entire life cycle from ""cradle to grave"" have to be considered to achieve more sustainable production and consumption patterns. Progress toward sustainability requires enhancing the methodologies for integrated assessment and mainstreaming of life cycle thinking from product development to strategic policy support. Life cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle costing (LCC) and social LCA (sLCA) already attempt to cover sustainability pillars, notwithstanding different levels of methodological development. An increasing concern on how to deal with the complexity of sustainability has promoted the development of life cycle sustainability frameworks. As a contribution to the ongoing scientific debate after the Rio+20 conference, this paper aims to present and discuss the state of the art of life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA), giving recommendations for its further development in line with ontological, epistemological and methodological aspects of sustainability science. Methods: Building on the review about the state of the art of sustainability science and sustainability assessment methods presented in part I, this paper discuss LCA, LCC, sLCA and LCSA against ontological, epistemological and methodological aspects of ongoing scientific debate on sustainability. Strengths and weaknesses of existing life cycle-based methodologies and methods are presented. Besides, existing frameworks for LCSA are evaluated against the criteria defined in part I in order to highlight coherence with sustainability science progress and to support better integration and mainstreaming of sustainability concepts. Conclusions and outlook: LCSA represents a promising approach for developing a transparent, robust and comprehensive assessment. Nevertheless, the ongoing developments should be in line with the most advanced scientific discussion on sustainability science, attempting to bridge the gaps between the current methods and methodologies for sustainability assessment. LCSA should develop so as to be hierarchically different from LCA, LCC and sLCA. It should represent the holistic approach which integrates (and not substitutes) the reductionist approach of the single part of the analysis. This implies maintaining the balance between analytical and descriptive approaches towards a goal and solution-oriented decision support methodology. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",10.1007/s11367-012-0509-5,International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,Life cycle sustainability assessment | Science-policy interface | Stakeholder involvement | Sustainability science | Value choices,84888643124,Life cycle sustainability assessment in the context of sustainability science progress (part 2),2013.0
768,"This paper provides a methodology for supply chain network (SCN) design under uncertainty. The problem is initially casted as a two-level organizational decision process: the design decisions must be made here and now, but the reengineered SCN can be used for daily operations only after an implementation period. The network structure can also be adapted during the planning horizon considered. When making the design decisions, the operational response and structural adaptation decisions taking place during the planning horizon must be anticipated. The methodology recognizes three event types to characterize the future SCN environment: random, hazardous and deep uncertainty events. At the design time, plausible futures are anticipated through a scenario planning approach. Several Monte Carlo scenario samples are generated and corresponding sample average approximation programs are solved in order to produce a set of alternative designs. A multi-criteria design evaluation approach is then applied to select the most effective and robust design among candidate solutions. An illustrative case, based on the location-transportation problem, is finally introduced to illustrate the approach, and computational experiments are performed to demonstrate its feasibility. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",10.1007/s00291-013-0327-6,OR Spectrum,Anticipation | Multi-hazards | Network disruptions | Robustness | Scenario planning | Stochastic programming | Supply chain network design | Uncertainty,84888043656,The design of robust value-creating supply chain networks,2013.0

770,"Material cycles have become increasingly coupled and interconnected in a globalizing era. While material flow analysis (MFA) has been widely used to characterize stocks and flows along technological life cycle within a specific geographical area, trade networks among individual cycles have remained largely unexplored. Here we developed a trade-linked multilevel MFA model to map the contemporary global journey of anthropogenic aluminum. We demonstrate that the anthropogenic aluminum cycle depends substantially on international trade of aluminum in all forms and becomes highly interconnected in nature. While the Southern hemisphere is the main primary resource supplier, aluminum production and consumption concentrate in the Northern hemisphere, where we also find the largest potential for recycling. The more developed countries tend to have a substantial and increasing presence throughout the stages after bauxite refining and possess highly consumption-based cycles, thus maintaining advantages both economically and environmentally. A small group of countries plays a key role in the global redistribution of aluminum and in the connectivity of the network, which may render some countries vulnerable to supply disruption.

771,"Purpose: The integration of business processes across multiple companies can provide economic benefits, thus ensuring the sustainability of the involved companies. However these advantages are accompanied by many potential risks. For instance, emerging disruptions within a supply chain can spread over several partners resulting in economic losses. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the development of a collaborative cross-supply chain framework that reduces the extent of loss after the occurrence of unforeseen damaging events in sensitive logistics nodes. Design/methodology/approach: To handle the impacts of unforeseen damaging events in sensitive logistics nodes, the focus of our approach lies on the implementation of a collaboratively applicable concept for sensitive logistics nodes that supports a rapid collaborative decision-making among the partners. Therefore, different damaging events as well as the logistics and transport processes in freight villages are determined and implemented in an agent-based simulation model. Findings: Multi-agent simulation can be used for a scenario-based collaborative risk management in sensitive logistics nodes. By executing simulation experiments the impacts of selected damaging events can be analysed and used for the development of scenario specific strategies for the partners in sensitive logistics nodes with the objective to maintain the flow of goods after disturbances. Practical implications: The paper proposes a multi-agent simulation, which can be used collaboratively in a cross-supply chain team to support decision-making processes in sensitive logistics nodes after a disruption has occurred. To get an effective and efficient tool, involved companies are included into the development and implementation processes.

Port activities have an important social, economic and environmental impact on neighbouring regions. Ports definitely generate added value and employment. However, at the same time, local populations increasingly perceive them as factors of negative externalities such as environmental pollution, security risks and traffic congestion. Their complex role in transport networks as well as in local territories inevitably makes seaports a great source of ""conflicts"". Various authors have already approached this topic adopting a stakeholder view, but only in relation to specific contexts and case studies and from a mono-disciplinary perspective.The aim of the paper is to investigate the nature and the dynamics of the major conflicts arising in ports. The manuscript, indeed, sets out the various types of port conflicts (e.g., social, institutional, operational, land use, etc.) and the diverse conflict processes impacting on port management.This study shows the results of preliminary fieldwork carried out in some selected ports in France and Italy.

Future smart grid supply chains must be secured to prevent cyber attacks from affecting energy infrastructure, and the societal and economic functions on which they depend. This perspective paper calls for a multiscale approach to address modeling and decision-making for energy system hardware supply chains.

775,"Within the supply chain context, schedule instability is caused by revisions to forecast demand from customers, problems with scheduled deliveries from suppliers, and disruptions to internal production. Supply chain partners attempt to address schedule instability by regular exchanges of information flows on current demand and delivery forecasts. However, if these updating information flows are unreliable and likely to be over-ridden by subsequent updated schedules, then the problem of schedule instability at the supplier-customer interface is not being solved. The research hypothesis investigated in this paper is whether supply chain partners may reduce schedule instability at the supplier-customer interface by identifying and omitting complexity-adding information flows. To this aim, previous work by the authors on an information-theoretic methodology for measuring complexity is extended and applied in this paper for identifying complexity-adding information flows. The application consists of comparing the complexity index of actual exchanged information flows with the complexity index of scenarios that omit one or more of these information flows. Using empirical results, it is shown that supply chain partners may reduce schedule instability at the supplier-customer interface by identifying and omitting complexity-adding information flows. The applied methodology is independent of the information systems used by the supplier and customer, and it provides an objective, integrative measure of schedule instability at the supplier-customer interface. Two case studies are presented, one in the commodity production environment of fast-moving consumer goods, and another in the customised production environment of electronic products sector. By applying the measurement and analysis methodology, relevant schedule instability-related insights about the specific case-studies are obtained. In light of the findings from these case studies, areas for further research and validation of the conditions in which the proposed research hypothesis holds are also proposed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.ijpe.2013.04.043,International Journal of Production Economics,Case studies | Entropy | Information flows | Operational complexity | Schedule instability | Supplier-customer interface,84880924324,Reducing schedule instability by identifying and omitting complexity-adding information flows at the supplier-customer interface,2013.0
776,"Reverse logistics networks are often implemented to ensure a sustainable product or material recovery and to improve a company's sustainability footprint. The most common approach for designing bi-directional networks is the independent design of reverse and forward networks. The joint integration of both networks is rarely considered. Here we study a strategic capacitated facility location problem with integrated bi-directional product flows through a network of multiple supply stages, including production allocations, uncertain data development, facility locations and flexible capacity adjustments. We extend the location and capacity problem by including the decision on the type of depot to install. Forwarding or collecting depots only process one designated direction. Hybrid sites process products of both flow directions. We first introduce a detailed deterministic model assessing the impact of incorporating reverse logistics into a forward-oriented supply chain. This is then extended to a robust capacitated facility location model, which minimizes the expectations of relative regrets for a set of scenarios over a multi-period planning horizon, while considering uncertainty regarding supplying and collecting goods. Example settings show the superior performance of the robust model compared to the deterministic model. The resulting network design mitigates the risks of higher costs and of not being able to fully satisfy demand. This is achieved at costs not significantly higher than the individual optimal solution and with solution times that are promising for applications in practice.

777,"This article provides a quality check of the degrowth movement's proposal of local currencies as tools for advancing socially equitable and ecologically sustainable degrowth. The article draws comprehensively upon mainly English-language academic research about four widespread local currency types - LETS, time banks, HOUR currencies, and convertible local currencies (CLCs) - to assess their performance with respect to four degrowth-related criteria: community-building, advancement of alternative values in economic exchange, facilitation of alternative livelihoods, and eco-localization. LETS have been found to support alternative livelihoods under quite uncommon conditions, and contribute indirectly to eco-localization by moderately facilitating informal resale, repair, and sharing of commercially produced goods, although their burdensome management and confinement to small memberships limit their usefulness. Time banks help expand social networks, and are best at reaching the socially excluded. However, they are confined to unskilled personal services and dependent on grant funding. HOUR currencies do not stand out with regard to any criteria, but may have a minor capacity to promote local purchasing. CLCs are best at attracting local businesses, but no significant evidence of their said capacity to localize supply chains has surfaced as yet, and their business-friendly design works to the detriment of other criteria. In sum, existing research provides a very weak basis for advocating local currencies as tools for purposive degrowth. Local currencies are here categorized as two utopian socialist approaches: the behind-society's-back variety of LETS and HOUR currencies, and the appeal-to-elites variety of time banks and CLCs. Marx and Engels's critiques of these approaches remain valid: successful monetary systems require resources that are not available behind society's back, notably the power to levy taxes and designate by which means they can be paid. Local currencies that appeal for elite support - without mass popular backing - have shaken off most radical connotations, and are vulnerable to changing policy agendas. Given the present historical conjuncture of popular outrage against the banking sector, this paper argues that the degrowth movement would improve its chances of contributing to purposive degrowth by prioritizing government-centred ecological reform of the monetary system over local currencies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

778,"The Egyptian economy and culture are centralized in the Greater Cairo region. Thus, it is essential that the built environment is able to withstand the possible earthquake events that may occur, and to continue to operate and function. Failure to do so would result in significant economic losses. This study presents the latter stages of a multi-tiered probabilistic earthquake loss estimation model for Greater Cairo and builds upon previous studies of the seismic hazard. In order to assess possible damage to the built environment, and the resulting economic losses, the vulnerability of the built environment is first evaluated. Through the use of satellite images, Egypts building census, previous studies and field surveys, a building-stock inventory is compiled. This building inventory is classified according to structural type and height, and is geocoded by district. Using existing fragility curves, the vulnerability of the building stock is assessed. In addition, the vulnerability of both the electricity and natural gas networks are assessed, through the use of fragility curves, cut sets and an evaluation of the supply networks. Based on the assessment of direct losses, the losses associated with building damage far exceed those associated with the considered network infrastructure. A macro-economic model is developed that takes into account damage to the built environment and provides estimates of indirect economic losses, as well as enabling the identification of the optimal recovery process. Using this model, it is shown that the indirect losses can exceed direct losses for extreme scenarios where the economy is brought to a near standstill. The framework developed and presented herein can be extended to include more networks, and is also applicable to other regions. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",10.1007/s10518-013-9426-7,Bulletin of Earthquake Engineering,Cairo | Direct economic loss | Earthquake loss estimation | Egypt | Indirect economic loss | Lifeline vulnerability | Network reliability | Recovery time,84880645021,Earthquake loss estimation for Greater Cairo and the national economic implications,2013.0
779,"Industrial ecosystems improve eco-efficiency at the system level through optimizing material and energy flows, which however raises a concern for system resilience because efficiency, as traditionally conceived, not necessarily promotes resilience. By drawing on the concept of resilience in ecological systems and in supply chains, resilience in industrial ecosystems is specified on the basis of a system's ability to maintain eco-efficient material and energy flows under disruptions. Using a network model that captures supply, asset, and organizational dependencies and propagation of disruptions among firms, the resilience, and particularly resistance as an important dimension of resilience, of two real industrial ecosystems and generalized specifications are examined. The results show that an industrial ecosystem is less resistant and less resilient with high inter-firm dependency, preferentially organized physical exchanges, and under disruptions targeted at highly connected firms. An industrial ecosystem with more firms and exchanges is less resistant, but has more eco-efficient flows and potentials, and therefore is less likely to lose its function of eco-efficiency. Taking these determinants for resilience into consideration improves the adaptability of an industrial ecosystem, which helps increase its resilience. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.02.052,Journal of Environmental Management,Adaptability | Industrial symbiosis | Material and energy flow | Network structure | Resilience | Resistance,84875822364,Exploring the resilience of industrial ecosystems,2013.0
780,"This article seeks to offer a systematic approach to establishing a reliable network of facilities in closed loop supply chains (CLSCs) under uncertainties. Facilities that are located in this article concurrently satisfy both traditional objective functions and reliability considerations in CLSC network designs. To attack this problem, a novel mathematical model is developed that integrates the network design decisions in both forward and reverse supply chain networks. The model also utilizes an effective reliability approach to find a robust network design. In order to make the results of this article more realistic, a CLSC for a case study in the iron and steel industry has been explored. The considered CLSC is multi-echelon, multi-facility, multi-product and multi-supplier. Furthermore, multiple facilities exist in the reverse logistics network leading to high complexities. Since the collection centres play an important role in this network, the reliability concept of these facilities is taken into consideration. To solve the proposed model, a novel interactive hybrid solution methodology is developed by combining a number of efficient solution approaches from the recent literature. The proposed solution methodology is a bi-objective interval fuzzy possibilistic chance-constraint mixed integer linear programming (BOIFPCCMILP). Finally, computational experiments are provided to demonstrate the applicability and suitability of the proposed model in a supply chain environment and to help decision makers facilitate their analyses. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",10.1080/0305215X.2012.704029,Engineering Optimization,chance-constrained programming | closed loop supply chain | fuzzy possibilistic | interval programming | network design | reliability,84878320783,Reliable design of a closed loop supply chain network under uncertainty: An interval fuzzy possibilistic chance-constrained model,2013.0
781,"Traditionally, corporate sustainability efforts have focused on the direct impacts of a company's waste or the emissions associated with its operations, buildings, and vehicles. However, the majority of the US economy's climate, water, and pollution impacts are the result of complex supply chains, strung together to deliver value-added products and services. To mitigate these indirect impacts (by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, for example) and adapt to new risks, leading companies must engage with upstream suppliers and embed sustainability as a joint objective. Companies failing to do so may suffer damage to their reputations and operations. In a changing climate, increasingly frequent and severe weather events are making supply networks more vulnerable to disruptions and unanticipated costs. Investors and other stakeholders are responding by pressuring companies to disclose and quantify emissions and other supply chain environmental impacts. Despite significant progress made by some corporations in reducing their emissions and their exposure to potential hazards hidden in upstream operations, sustainability must be a society-wide effort. © The Author(s) 2013.",10.1177/0096340213487310,Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,Climate change | Corporate sustainability | Globalization | Natural catastrophes | Reputation | Superstorm | Supply chain,84879364609,Climate change: Corporate sustainability in the supply chain,2013.0
782,"Inefficient delivery and inadequate coverage of water supply and sanitation services are major concerns for public health in the urban regions of developing countries. The contamination of the treated water within distribution system leads to frequent outbreaks of waterborne diseases. This demands a proactive approach that is based on risk assessment and a management methodology to ensure water safety. In this context, the paper presents a model study undertaken for the water supply network of a pilot area in Hyderabad city, India. The risk assessment methodology uses geospatial databases of the water supply network, sewer network, open drains, groundwater table, pressure in pipes, and soil data with a number of system-specific attributes. Fuzzy multi-criteria evaluation approach with qualitative and quantitative domain knowledge is employed in pipe condition assessment model. The physical parameters viz. pipe age, material, diameter; operational parameters viz. intermittency, number of breaks and bursts, and leakage in the system; and environmental parameters viz. workmanship, bedding condition, and traffic determine the vulnerability of pipes to contaminant intrusion. The zones of contamination formed in the soil near open drains and sewer crossings (i.e., hazards) are delineated using a contaminant ingress model. The risk of contaminant intrusion is assessed as a function of vulnerability and hazard. The results indicate that roughly 3% of pipes in the network are in Bad condition and require rehabilitation on a priority basis; about 46% of pipes are in Medium condition. The study describes a techno-economically feasible approach to assist water managers and policy makers in delivering safe drinking water. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2012.08.002,"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems",Contaminant ingress | Multi-criteria evaluation | Pipe condition assessment | Risk assessment | Water distribution system,84877623189,Model study for rehabilitation planning of water supply network,2013.0
783,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate empirically the critical factors for the diffusion of web technologies in supply chain management (SCM) functions, based on the technology-organizational-environment model, and to identify the benefits resulting from diffusion. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected, via an internet survey, from 251 respondents, ranging from middle-level to top-level managers, from firms which currently utilize web technologies for their supply chain activities. Structural equation modelling was employed for five factors: relative advantage; competitive pressure; complexity; trialability; and top management support, which have been hypothesized to affect the diffusion of web technologies in SCM functions. Findings: The results suggest that all the factors except trialability are significant predictors of web technologies' diffusion in supply chain functions. The results show also that by diffusing web technologies, organizations can enhance their supply chain activities. Research limitations/implications: The survey was conducted in a Malaysian context, using a limited set of variables, thus limiting the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications: This study provides a greater understanding of managers' perception of web technology diffusion in their organizational SCM functions, and benefits realizing from diffusion of web technology, such as operational efficiency.

784,"This paper presents a robust design for a multi-product, multi-echelon, closed-loop logistic network model in an uncertain environment. The model includes a general network structure considering both forward and reverse processes that can be used in various industries, such as electronics, digital equipment, and vehicles. Because logistic network design is a time consuming and costly project as well as a strategic and sensitive decision (i.e. the change of such decision is difficult in the future), a robust optimisation approach is adopted to cope with the uncertainty of demand and the return rate described by a finite set of possible scenarios. Hence, to obtain robust solutions with better time, the scenario relaxation algorithm is employed for the proposed model. Numerical examples and a sensitivity analysis are presented to demonstrate the significance and applicability of the presented model. It is shown that solutions resulted from the suggested approach insure more situations, especially in worst case ones. The results show that although the profit values of the robust configuration are less than the deterministic configuration, the robust configuration is more reliable than the deterministic one because the deterministic configuration is infeasible under some demand and return rates (i.e. in the worst cases). Moreover, the results show the computing time superiority of the algorithm compared to the extensive form model as well as optimality of the resulted solutions. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.",10.1007/s00170-012-4369-8,International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,Closed-loop logistic network | Robust optimisation | Scenario relaxation algorithm | Supply chain management | Uncertainty,84880570741,A robust design for a closed-loop supply chain network under an uncertain environment,2013.0
785,"Purpose: Low-carbon economy requires the pursuit of eco-efficiency, which is a win-win situation between economic and environmental efficiency. In this paper the question of trading off the economic and environmental effects embodied in eco-efficiency in the hybrid manufacturing/remanufacturing logistics network design in the context of low-carbon economy is examined. Design/methodology/approach: A multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model to find the optimal facility locations and materials flow allocation is established. In the objective function, three minimum targets are set: economic cost, CO2 emission and waste generation. Through an iterative algorithm, the Pareto Boundary of the problem is obtained. Findings: The results of numeric study show that in order to achieve a Pareto improvement over an original system, three of the critical rates (i.e. return rate, recovery rate, and cost substitute rate) should be increased. Practical implications: To meet the need of low-carbon dioxide, an iso- CO2 emission curve in which decision makers have a series of optimal choices with the same CO2 emission but different cost and waste generation is plotted. Each choice may have different network design but all of these are Pareto optimal solutions, which provide a comprehensive evaluation of both economics and ecology for the decision making. Originality/value: This research chooses carbon emission as one of the three objective functions and uses Pareto sets to analyze how to balance profitability and environmental impacts in designing remanufacturing closed-loop supply chain in the context of low-carbon economy.",10.3926/jiem.665,Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management,Eco-efficiency | Hybrid manufacturing/remanufacturing system | Logistic network design | Low-carbon economy | Pareto improvement | Tradeoff,84875503957,Eco-efficient based logistics network design in hybrid manufacturing/ remanufacturing system in low-carbon economy,2013.0
786,"Based upon an increasing academic and business interest in greening the industrial supply chains, this paper establishes the need for a state-of-the-art decision support system (DSS) for carbon emissions accounting and management, mainly across the product supply chains by identifying methodological shortcomings in existing tools, and proposing a supply chain (SC) framework which provide businesses with a holistic understanding of their supply chains and ensuring partners within supply chain collaborative networks have a shared understanding of their emissions. It describes the design and development of a DSS now known as supply chain environmental analysis tool (SCEnAT) in detail, putting its unique and innovative features into a comparative perspective vis-à-vis existing tools and software of different types. The methodological framework used to design and develop SCEnAT integrates different individual techniques/methods of supply chain (SC) mapping, SC carbon accounting, SC interventions and SC interventions evaluation on a range of key performance indicators (KPIs). These individual methods have been used and applied innovatively to the challenge of designing SCEnAT within the desired framework. Finally, we demonstrate the application of SCEnAT, especially the advantage of using a robust carbon accounting methodology, to a SC case study. The SCEnAT framework pushes the theoretical boundary by addressing the problems of intra-organisational approach in decision making for lowering carbon along the supply chain; with an open innovation, cutting edge, hybridised framework that considers the supply chain as a whole in co-decision making for lowering carbon along the supply chain with the most robust methodology of hybrid life cycle analysis (LCA) that considers direct and indirect emissions and interventional performance evaluation for low carbon technology investment and business case building in order to adapt and mitigate climate change problems.

787,"The presented approach aims to overcome the scarce data problem in service life modeling of water networks by combining subjective expert knowledge and local replacement data. A procedure to elicit imprecise quantile estimates of survival functions from experts, considering common cognitive biases, was developed and applied. The individual expert priors of the parameters of the service life distribution are obtained by regression over the stated distribution quantiles and aggregated into a single prior distribution. Furthermore, a likelihood function for the commonly encountered censored and truncated pipe replacement data is formulated. The suitability of the suggested Bayesian approach based on elicitation data from eight experts and real network data is demonstrated. Robust parameter estimates could be derived in data situations where frequentist maximum likelihood estimation is unsatisfactory, and to show how the consideration of imprecision and in-between-variance of experts improves posterior inference. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.11.013,Environmental Modelling and Software,Bayesian inference | Expert aggregation | Expert knowledge elicitation | Scarce data | Service life modeling | Water supply network,84874515592,Combining expert knowledge and local data for improved service life modeling of water supply networks,2013.0

789,"Building energy assessment is usually performed based on fundamentals of the First Law of Thermodynamics, which is especially concerned on quantitative energy aspects. However, this approach does not provide a faithful thermodynamic evaluation of the overall energy conversion processes that occur in buildings, and a more robust approach should be followed. The exergy analysis is a useful method that combines First Law and Second Law perspectives and has been applied in many related engineering fields, power plants analysis, CHP systems, heat pumps or building energy systems. In this study, the overall energy and exergy performance of eight space heating options is compared for different outdoor environmental conditions. The methodology follows an approach from demand (at building envelope) to supply side (primary energy supplied), assuming that each energy supply network (ESN) or heating option is divided into the following sub-systems: room, emission, heat generator and power plant. The related energy and exergy performance of each ESN is evaluated through the following indicators: primary energy ratio (PER) and primary exergy ratio (PExR). The results show that for similar primary energy performance, PExR may assume distinct values depending on outdoor environmental conditions. The most energy efficient ESN has a PER of 2.2, while the related PExR changes from 7% to 16% for Lisbon and Berlin, respectively. Furthermore, the assessment of irreversibility rate associated to each ESN sub-system reveals the sources of inefficiencies could be pinpointed and measured, leading to tangible suggestions for further improvements. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.enbuild.2013.02.023,Energy and Buildings,Exergy analysis | Irreversibility rate | Primary energy ratio | Primary exergy ratio | TRNSYS,84875182942,Comparative energy and exergy performance of heating options in buildings under different climatic conditions,2013.0

Primary data were gathered from a cluster of firms operating in a high-velocity environment. The results provide an insight about the FOSS adoption process to both practitioners and academics alike. Our results indicate that performance attitude of managers, data regulation and facilitating conditions are important determinants of a firm's behavioural intention (BI) to adopt and use FOSS.

791,"Transport networks have to provide carriers with time-efficient alternative routes in case of disruptions. It is, therefore, essential for transport network planners and operators to identify sections within the network which, if broken, have a considerable negative impact on the network's performance. Research on transport network analysis provides lots of different approaches and models in order to identify such critical sections. Most of them, however, are only applicable to mono-modal transport networks and calculate indices which represent the criticality of sections by using aggregated data. The model presented, in contrast, focuses on the analysis of intermodal transport networks by using a traffic micro simulation. Based on available, real-life data, our approach models a transport network as well as its actual traffic participants and their individual decisions in case of a disruption. The resulting transport delay time due to a specific disruption helps to identify critical sections and critical networks, as a whole. Therefore, the results are a valuable decision support for transport network planners and operators in order to make the infrastructure less vulnerable, more attractive for carriers and thus more economically sustainable. In order to show the applicability of the model we analyse the Austrian intermodal transport network and show how critical sections can be evaluated by this approach. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.dss.2012.05.060,Decision Support Systems,Intermodal transport network | Network vulnerability | Supply chain disruption | Traffic micro simulation | Transport network analysis,84875211538,Analysing the impact of disruptions in intermodal transport networks: A micro simulation-based model,2013.0

793,"For a regional port necessarily involved in global supply chains, the development of its hinterland region is critical to its long term sustainability. Such development can be fostered by a regional innovation system (RIS), although the risks of path dependency and lock-in may lead to a region decaying. A process for contributing to a RIS is the Regional Development Platform Model (RDPM), the focus of this paper. As a new approach to regional development, the RDPM is utilised and adapted to identify opportunities for potential development in a region. In this paper, the RDPM is linked to the role of a port authority and its potential to drive regional growth centred on its innovation network. Port authorities, by assuming the role of network leader, can shape the regional innovation network and create new development trajectories through their links to various levels of government and the wide range of stakeholders that utilise the port facilities. The inherent tensions in this role and the competing possibilities of path creation and path dependence to create value for a wide network of stakeholders are challenging.The paper investigates the use of the RDPM and how port authorities can influence development strategies for mutual benefit in this context. More specifically, a case study of the Burnie Port in Tasmania, Australia is conducted by utilising desktop research, interviews, an expert panel and industry roundtable to demonstrate that the RDPM has the potential as an approach beyond analysing the main sources of path dependency in a local region. By following the adaptation of the RDPM, it is argued that the trajectory of path dependency can be interrupted, for example by a port authority, enabling the potential for new paths to be created. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2012.06.015,Journal of Transport Geography,Path dependency | Port strategy | Regional development platform method | Regional innovation system,84872393250,Regional port authorities: Leading players in innovation networks?,2013.0

However, supply chains are susceptible to unanticipated events that make responsive supply chain management a challenging task. One such disruption event is a product stockout at the retailer. In this paper, we investigate retail stockouts through the development of an agent-based simulation model in order to develop a better understanding of the effect of different stockout lengths for different products (with different consumer response profiles to stockouts) on both the retailer and the manufacturer of the product.

795,"Because the supply network of an enterprise should be flexible enough to capture and overcome market dynamics, one of the major concerns of global enterprises is to make their supply network reconfigurable. Although many strategies for flexible management of a supply network have been proposed, especially for mitigating supply network risks, it still remains unclear how to apply the strategies to a supply network and how to reconfigure the supply network. This paper examines the influence of flexibility strategies in a dynamic global market environment on the structure of supply network, and proposes a method of reconfiguring the supply network of an enterprise to cope with its flexibility strategies. A reconfigurable supply network model is proposed, and flexibility strategies are classified, and critical indices of strategies are defined. In the proposed model, each business actor is defined as a network node and each node has its own goal. A node optimizes its goal to reduce and overcome the risk of market environments. The result of optimization indicates that the supply network structure is reconfigured dynamically. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

796,"Summary: A dissolved air flotation (DAF) system upgrade was proposed for an urban paper mill to recycle effluent. To understand the influence of operating variables on the environmental impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and water consumption, a dynamic supply chain model was linked with life cycle assessment (LCA) to produce an environmental inventory. Water is a critical natural resource, and understanding the environmental impacts of recycling water is paramount in continued development of sustainable supply chains involving water. The methodology used in this study bridged the gap between detailed process models and static LCA modeling so that operating variables beyond discrete scenario analysis could be investigated without creating unnecessarily complex models. The model performed well in evaluating environmental impacts. It was found that there was no single optimum operating regime for all environmental impacts. For a mill discharging 80 cubic meters of effluent per hour (m3/hour), GHGs could be minimized with a DAF capacity of 17.5 m3/hour, while water consumption could be minimized with a DAF capacity of 25 m3/hour, which allowed insight into where environmental trade-offs would occur. The study shows that more complexity can be achieved in supply chain modeling without requiring a full technical model. It also illustrates the need to consider multiple environmental impacts and highlights the trade-off of GHG emissions with water consumption in water recycling. The supply chain model used in this water treatment case study was able to identify the environmental trade-offs from the operating variables selected. © 2013 by Yale University.",10.1111/jiec.12029,Journal of Industrial Ecology,Dissolved air flotation | Industrial ecology | Life cycle inventory (LCI) | Pulp and paper | Water recycling | Water reuse,84885478011,Life cycle assessment of advanced industrial wastewater treatment within an urban environment,2013.0

However, this tendency of supply chain network complexity intensifies the uncertainty of supply chain network's operating environment; any node in the supply chain network occurs unexpected incident which will soon affect the associated upstream and downstream enterprises and then affect the all enterprises on the network. For cascading problems of supply chain, this study proposed a capacity reallocation strategy with local and global information integrated. Based on this strategy, three attacking methods were adopted to simulate emergency events of supply chain and the vulnerability of supply chain network is measured through maximum connected subgraph and network efficiency.

798,"Electric power supply companies increasingly rely on enterprise IT systems to provide them with a comprehensive view of the state of the distribution network. Within a utility-wide network, enterprise IT systems collect data from various metering devices. Such data can be effectively used for the prediction of power supply network vulnerability. The purpose of this paper is to present the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)-based Sensor Web integration solution that we have developed with the purpose of enabling prediction of power supply network vulnerability, in terms of a prediction of defect probability for a particular network element. We will give an example of its usage and demonstrate our vulnerability prediction model on data collected from two different power supply companies. The proposed solution is an extension of the GinisSense Sensor Web-based architecture for collecting, processing, analyzing, decision making and alerting based on the data received from heterogeneous data sources. In this case, GinisSense has been upgraded to be capable of operating in an ESB environment and combine Sensor Web and GIS technologies to enable prediction of electric power supply system vulnerability.

799,"© ExcelingTech Pub, UK. The success of JIT in Japan inspired many organizations to adopt JIT to the supply chain in order to reduce the waste and cost. These organizations have to face inherent challenging issues and complexities while implementing JIT concepts in supply chain. The manufacturer must be in position to identify challenging issues, its consequences so as to design a robust and reliable supply chain accordingly otherwise the manufacturing system may not provide the desired results. The focus of this paper is on the significant challenging issues in JIT supply chain from product variety perspective. Some challenging issues act as driver for sustainable implementation of JIT supply chain. For adoption of JIT supply chain, significant issues must be identified, analysed and discussed. In this research, study factors are the challenging issues for sustainable JIT supply chain implementation. Authors have identified ten significant issues from literature review. The main objectives are to identify and rank the challenging issues for implementation, to develop and to analysed the interaction between identified challenging issues using ISM and to prepare a framework for successful JIT supply chain implementation.",,International Journal of Supply Chain Management,Challenges | JIT supply chain | Just-in-time (JIT) | Lean | Product variety; Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM),84943198761,Interpretive structural modelling for challenging issues in jit supply chain: Product variety perspective,2013.0
800,"Green supply chain management consists of companies applying green concepts to managing their supply chains. It is a new way to enhance company competitiveness. In particular, reverse logistics aims to optimize reverse product flows to limit residual waste. One of the most critical problems in the reverse logistics field is the design of reverse logistic networks. The purpose of this work is to propose a comprehensive generic model that can help decision makers to design networks that cover remanufacturing activities. This model also aims to help devise strategies for the pricing of used and remanufactured products. More precisely a dynamic, multi-commodity, two-level capacitated facility-location problem for the green design of reverse logistic networks is presented. Therefore, both economic and ecological costs of reverse logistic activities are taken into account to help minimize the damages of the reverse supply chain on the environment. Last, in order to better reflect real cases, this model includes fundamental features of reverse logistics that have been overlooked in the literature, namely, uncertainty in product returns, time dependency of the decision variables, capacity constraints, and the possibility of treating multiple classes of products at one time. © KEDGE BS.",10.1080/16258312.2013.11517311,Supply Chain Forum,Dynamic facility location | Green supply chain design | Multi-commodity | Remanufacturing activities | Reverse logistics | Uncertain returns,84897083108,A generic model for network design including remanufacturing activities,2013.0
801,"From a past perspective, System Engineering was able to control the product data accuracy with respect to its requirements and towards product certification and delivery avoiding operational disruptions in the development lifecycle. But we usually do it by increasing the complexity of the product data management and administration what makes heavier the product integration. The trends indicate that the product complexity is intensifying and that the increasing load rate of changes will create serious efficiency disruptions if we persevere with today System Engineering approaches. New System Engineering paradigm is then proposed. It conducts to an innovative management of product identification and business integration. It is supported 4 key pillars: The Semantic Product IdentificationThe Business Driven IntelligenceThe Product Life-Cycle Social ManagementThe Data Management of Things It is highlighted the wide range of possibilities that could offer new product data aggregation laws based on correlating semantic context information. The other elements of the new PDM paradigm add an apparatus of synergy, management and lean architecture principles of the solutions.

802,"This paper aims at conceptualising and assessing operational environment of small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) in sustainable supply chains in regional context. The paper starts an attempt to explore how SMEs in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in Germany from transport, logistics related value-added services and especially from the air freight sector collaborate, perform and develop from supply chain management perspective, and what crucial determinants for burgeoning business performance and sustainable strategy are effectively to be linked for the benefits of SMEs. Using a qualitative case study approach, the paper bears on empirical evidences of the project ""Baltic.AirCargo.Net"" financed by the European Regional Development F und / European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument in the framework of the Baltic Sea Region Programme 2007-2013. The paper builds upon a qualitative research approach involving expert interviews, focus groups analysis and secondary data research based on relevant project documentation and field notes from project meetings and workshops. F indings of the case study from the German air cargo service providers are explored and discussed through key theoretical concepts pertaining to sustainable supply chains and logistics of SMEs. Based on the relevant scholarly work and results of empirical evidence and case studies, a conceptual model is designed with propositions and possible future directions for SMEs. The paper showcases empirical findings gathered from the practices of regional SMEs operating in the air cargo transport and logistics service field, thus expanding this poorly conceived research area. The research is based on direct information and insights from SMEs located in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and highlights how SMEs under the given circumstances may streamline their development paths operationally, tactically and strategically.

803,"The research proposes an approach based on modelling and simulation (M&S) for asymmetric threats (i.e., piracy, terrorism etc.) in complex, maritime scenarios in order to support decision makers and trainers in operational and organisational procedures. Considering that coordination and communication are really critical to face asymmetric threats and that the port is a complex network involving several actors, authors underline the importance of simulation and describe a set of simulation models for supporting decision making and training to face asymmetric threats. This paper provides an overview on a combined approach using interoperable M&S and data fusion techniques to analyse complex scenarios involving asymmetric threats in marine environments, in particular coastal areas and harbours; use of intelligent agents as driver for computer generated forces (IA-CGF) is a critical element for modelling events where many entities interact simultaneously (i.e., commercial and nautical traffic around a port). © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",10.1504/IJSPM.2013.057546,International Journal of Simulation and Process Modelling,Computer generated forces | Data fusion | HBM | Human behaviour modelling | IA-CGFs | Maritime and harbour security | Simulation,84887971706,Interoperable simulation for asymmetric threats in maritime scenarios: A case based on virtual simulation and intelligent agents,2013.0
804,"The efficient and effective movement of goods from raw material sites to processing facilities, component fabrication plants, finished goods assembly plants, distribution centres, retailers and customers are critical in today's competitive environment. These in turn depend on facility location decisions taken during strategic planning. These facilities are expensive to construct and difficult to modify. Inefficient locations for production and assembly plants as well as distribution centres will result in excess costs being incurred throughout the lifetime of the facilities, no matter how well the production plans, transportation options, inventory management, and information sharing decisions are optimised in response to changing conditions. This paper addresses design of network model for facility location and capacity allocation where in a set of customer locations with demands and a set of candidate facility locations will be known in advance. If a facility is located at a candidate site, a known fixed location cost is incurred. There is a known unit shipment cost between each candidate site and each customer location. The problem is to find the locations of the facilities and the shipment pattern between the facilities and the customers to minimise the combined facility location and shipment costs subject to a requirement that all customer demands be met. To optimise this, the distribution network model is mathematically represented and solved using hybrid PSO algorithm. © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",10.1504/IJBSR.2013.053754,International Journal of Business and Systems Research,Capacitated plant location model | Hybrid PSO | Supply chain network,84901055972,Constrained optimisation of distribution network using new hybrid PSO optimiser,2013.0
805,"This paper provides a risk modeling approach to facilitate the evaluation and the design of Supply Chain Networks (SCNs) operating under uncertainty. The usefulness of the approach is demonstrated with two realistic case studies. Three event types are defined to describe plausible future SCN environments: random, hazardous and deeply uncertain events. A three-phase hazard modeling approach is also proposed. It involves a characterization of SCN hazards in terms of multihazards, vulnerability sources and exposure levels; the estimation of incident arrival, intensity and duration processes; and the assessment of SCN hit consequences in terms of damage and time to recovery. Based on these descriptive models, a Monte Carlo approach is then proposed to generate plausible future scenarios. The two cases studied illustrate the key aspects of the approach, and how it can be used to obtain resilient SCNs under disruptions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

806,"Mountain regions and peripheral communities, which often depend on few economic sectors, are among the most exposed and sensitive to climate change. Governance of such socio-economic-ecological networks plays a strong role in determining their resilience. Social processes of governance, such as collaboration between communities, can be systematically assessed through the existence and strength of connections between actors and their embeddedness in the broader socio-economic network by social network analysis (SNA). This paper examines how network governance of the tourism industry-dependent Swiss Gotthard region relates to resilience to climate change by SNA. The paper argues that economic diversification and a network structure supporting stability, flexibility, and innovation increase regional resilience to climate change. The Gotthard network has a high diversification capability due to high cohesion and close collaboration, limited innovative capacity by the existence of only two subgroups, and considerable flexibility through the centralized structure. Main weaknesses are a low density, uneven distribution of power, and a lack of integration of some supply chain sectors into the overall network. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/s10113-012-0294-5,Regional Environmental Change,Adaptive capacity | Mountain communities | Regional environmental change | Social network analysis | Vulnerability,84869190943,Network governance and regional resilience to climate change: Empirical evidence from mountain tourism communities in the Swiss Gotthard region,2012.0
807,"The importance of social responsibility of corporate and business units is increasingly emphasized by researchers and practitioners in recent years. Since supply chains play important roles in todays business environment, the issue of social responsibility should be considered carefully when designing and planning of supply chains to move towards sustainability. This paper addresses the problem of socially responsible supply chain network design under uncertain conditions. To this aim, first a bi-objective mathematical programming model is developed wherein its objective functions include minimizing the total cost and maximizing the supply chain social responsibility. Then, for coping with uncertain parameters effectively, a novel possibilistic programming approach, called robust possibilistic programming (RPP), is proposed. Several varieties of RPP models are developed and their differences, weaknesses, strengths and the most suitable conditions for being used are discussed. A real industrial case study is provided to illustrate the performance and applicability of the proposed RPP models in practice. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.fss.2012.04.010,Fuzzy Sets and Systems,Corporate social responsibility | Fuzzy mathematical programming | Necessity measure | Robust possibilistic programming | Supply chain network design,84864579681,Robust possibilistic programming for socially responsible supply chain network design: A new approach,2012.0
808,"QC laboratories are one of the most complicated environments to schedule, especially in labs that have a high product mix and diversified products that are tested with large number of analysts and instruments. In order to schedule this level of complexity, a robust computerized solution is required to minimize the time spent by the supervisors and provide the flexibility to react to schedule changes and optimize the overall lab performance in terms of cycle time, on-time delivery, and efficiency. Improving campaigning by leveraging a computerized solution can significantly reduce overtime and improve efficiency. These are key in reducing lab costs and provide a more reliable supply chain partner to the manufacturing. While having the right number of resources using a resource model is key in ensuring the lab ability to support incoming samples, the ability to effectively schedule the lab will help manage the daily and weekly fluctuations that are inherent in our current business conditions that call for low inventory and an agile supply chain.",,Pharmaceutical Engineering,,84872149337,Resource scheduling in QC laboratories,2012.0
809,"It is critical to facilitate business partners to be seamlessly interoperable with each other as the network-centric manufacturing (NCM) paradigm becomes a major trend in today's manufacturing environment. In this work, we propose a semantic e-Kanban inventory system where a semantic gateway is acting as a mapping hub to enable heterogeneous messages to be seamlessly exchanged between business partners on demand. The semantic gateway uses reasoning rules to map business partners' proprietary data schemas and provides interoperability required for NCM. To observe the network dynamics of our proposed system, a discrete time dynamic model is built and shows its growth to a scale-free network with a convergence rate depending on the initial connectivity of the semantic gateway and preferential attachment parameters. To analyse the proposed system from an economic perspective, analytical and numerical studies are conducted showing that it has enough potential to reduce supply chain costs in comparison to those of the traditional approach. Finally, this study attempts to address the cost-sharing issue encountered when multiple partners are direct beneficiaries of the efficiency gain through a joint network-centric capability, but it is questionable who should pay for the capability implementation. The cost-sharing issue must be investigated because most network-centric capabilities would not be economically or technically feasible for an individual company to achieve. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.",10.1080/00207543.2011.618147,International Journal of Production Research,Cost sharing | e-Kanban | Information value | Interoperability | Network-centric manufacturing | Preferential attachment | RDF | Semantic gateway | Web service | XML,84867068766,"A semantic e-Kanban system for network-centric manufacturing: Technology, scale-free convergence, value and cost-sharing considerations",2012.0
810,"Supplier selection has been a popular topic since the selection of the most appropriate supplier for cooperation is being increasingly important for the success of an enterprise. The problem is multi-criteria in nature, and a variety of multi-criteria decision making methodologies have been proposed. However, most of them did not take into account the interrelationships among the critical success factors and the fuzziness of the data involved in deciding the preferences of the factors. The objective of this research is to propose a fuzzy analytic network process model to evaluate various aspects of suppliers. With the consultation with the experts, the proposed model can consider the feedback and interdependency of factors in a network, and the factors are pairwise compared under an uncertain environment. The weights of factors can be calculated, and the final priority of suppliers obtained.

812,"In this study, a general comprehensive model is proposed for strategic closed-loop supply chain network design under interval data uncertainty. The proposed model considers various assumptions such as multiple periods, multiple products, and multiple supply chain echelons as well as uncertain demand and purchasing cost. In addition, bill of materials for each product is considered via a new approach in management of forward and reverse flows of products for producing new products and reusing or disassembling returned products. Uncertainty of parameters in the proposed model is handled via an interval robust optimisation technique. The model assumptions are well matched with decision making environments of food and high-tech electronics manufacturing industries. The factors that make these two industries similar are time-dependent properties of products such as prices and warehousing lifetime period.

813,"Supply chain is a typical scenario of exploiting Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. Its growing use in all the supply chain areas makes the presence of many close RFID readers more common. In such environment, interferences among readers are critical. Many protocols have been proposed to reduce reader-to-reader collisions. Experimental data showed that the Neighbor Friendly Reader Anticollision (NFRA) protocol (IEEE Trans. Ind. Electron., vol. 56, no. 7, pp. 2326-2336, July 2009) maximizes the network throughput. However, it does not take into account the delay between the request and the granting of query tags, causing delays for some readers.

814,"The water industry is capital intensive and dependent on complex supply networks in the delivery of service characteristics, making procurement a critical activity. This paper rejects 'the lowest bid' form of procurement of the past and advocates the total cost and strategic relationship management procurement of the future. The authors develop arguments for more effective procurement leading to real cost reduction and service enhancement on a sustainable basis. This requires a range of strategic activities from the approach to the acquisition of major capital goods and associated services through to the management of relationships with contractors, suppliers and supply chains. The paper considers the differing procurement practices in Europe, Australia and the USA, and how, in comparison, equivalent practices result in higher costs in the UK than elsewhere. From this they propose a model for best practice procurement in the utilities industries and a step-by-step set of actions for improving performance.

The model and decision framework aid the decision maker in forming a construction project team that can most benefit the overall goal of sustainability and compatibility amongst the subcontractors (supply chain) from a number of trade industries. The model uses both the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Analytic Network Process (ANP) as its basis. Once the generic decision model is defined, an example application is described to show its use and feasibility. The robustness of the solution is demonstrated using sensitivity analysis, allowing the decision maker to appreciate the complexities in this decision environment.

816,"The global supplier network is becoming an increasingly important asset for many firms. If successfully managed, supplier relationships may support the firm's strategic orientation and become a sustainable advantage on the global market. A key question is thus how the firm can develop and maintain such relationships. The market-driving strategy has recently been advanced as a more pro-active type of market orientation that aims to reconfigure the supply chain, change the nature of competition and the values of the customers. We especially investigate how market-driving firms can develop their supplier relationships so that they actively support this strategy. We present a set of propositions that specify factors critical for the development of the market-driving firm's supplier relationships and develop a theoretical framework that specifies how these different factors interact in order to strengthen the market-driving orientation of a supplier relationship.

817,"The term ""system"" is defined as a: ""...set or arrangement of elements (people, products, (hardware, software) and processes (facilities, equipment, material, and procedures)) that are related and whose behavior satisfies customer/operational needs, and provides for the life cycle sustainment of the products"" [1]. Similarly, ""enterprise"" is described as a: ""goal-directed complex system of resources -human, information, financial, and physical-and activities, usually a significant operational scope, complication, risk, and duration"" [2], However, the necessities of today's market governed by intense competition, globalizations, and battles among supply chains, have changed the focus on how an enterprise conducts its business. Enterprises are gradually moving on from operating as a stand-alone entity to producing goods and services through a network of independent or semi-independent organizations [3]. As a result, enterprises are becoming extended network-based organisms able to operate in extremely complex environments [4]. In order to capture the dynamic nature of such entities, existing approaches can be combined to introduce an Extended Enterprise System (EES) as ""a complex network of distinctive yet distributed and interdependent organizational systems that are connected in an autonomic way to achieve objectives beyond reaching capacities of each"" [5]. The type of interactions among constituent systems of such a network might be defined based on hierarchy, collaboration, coordination, or a combinatorial form. Regardless of the interconnectivity rules and forms that results in an increased flexibility and adaptability, an EES is not devoid of being susceptible to sudden, unforeseen vulnerability that can put it in a position of great risk through astronomical financial losses and a steep decline in its overall market share, thereby leading to the loss in its competitive advantage. Since developing a ""risk free"" strategy that enables the ""ideal"" functioning of an EES is nearly impossible in the currently prevailing business environment, having a clear understanding of the critical risks associated with the functioning of an EES is absolutely necessary for its growth and sustenance in the business environment. Furthermore, the boundaries for evaluation and management of risks associated with an EES are inherited from a plethora of intra- as well as inter-organizational relationships [6,7] that stretches well beyond those associated with its enterprise-centric counterparts, and therefore warrants a great deal of attention from policy-makers as a part of designing a well-structured risk mitigation strategy. However, despite the rapidly growing popularity of EES among practitioners, there is still a considerable void in the open literature on evaluating the critical risks associated with an EES, something that the current research is trying to shed some light on. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",10.1109/MAES.2012.6226688,IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine,,84863486090,Evaluating risks associated with extended enterprise systems (EES),2012.0

819,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to report insights on supply chain issues in small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) based on an analysis of six case organizations. Design/methodology/approach: A broad range of qualitative and quantitative data was collected during interviews and field visits in a multi-case study research design. In total, six manufacturing SME units were investigated and analyzed. Findings: The deliverables ofthe paper are two-fold. First, the paper documents six cases uncovering supply chain and operations complexities in manufacturing SMEs. Second, based on the critical analysis of the case organizations, insights developed are reported with a set of recommendations. Practical implications: The field of supply chain management (SCM) is reaching a new stage. After a period dominated by enthusiasm for the newness of the idea of managing the stream of products across the whole chain, from supply through manufacturing to end-users, it is now realized that ""one size does not fit all"". SCM has been considered an effective strategy for integrating suppliers and customers with the objective of improving responsiveness and flexibility of manufacturing organizations. It seems that the supply chain issues are much explored in the context of large enterprises but less attention is paid to SMEs. Originality/value: This paper draws an attention towards select supply chain issues in Indian manufacturing SMEs. The paper includes six cases highlighting their supply chain issues in the Indian environment. Subsequently, an analysis is reported to acquaint industry practitioners and contemporary researchers with the issues that influence managing supply chain in SME sectors.

820,"With the world's population now in excess of 7 billion, it is vital to ensure the chemical and microbiological safety of our food, while maintaining the sustainability of its production, distribution and trade. Using UN databases, here we show that the international agro-food trade network (IFTN), with nodes and edges representing countries and import-export fluxes, respectively, has evolved into a highly heterogeneous, complex supply-chain network. Seven countries form the core of the IFTN, with high values of betweenness centrality and each trading with over 77% of all the countries in the world. Graph theoretical analysis and a dynamic food flux model show that the IFTN provides a vehicle suitable for the fast distribution of potential contaminants but unsuitable for tracing their origin. In particular, we show that high values of node betweenness and vulnerability correlate well with recorded large food poisoning outbreaks. © 2012 Ercsey-Ravasz et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0037810,PLoS ONE,,84861702402,Complexity of the international agro-food trade network and its impact on food safety,2012.0

822,"Before the Gulf War, the population of Iraq enjoyed a relatively high level of water supply and sanitation services. The sector operated efficiently, utilizing then-current technologies. Since, the water supply and sanitation sector has experienced a steady but devastating decline. Aging infrastructure, poorly maintained equipment, leaking water and sewer networks, and low technical capacity and morale are some of the key problems of the sector. The lack of funding led to insufficient imports, lack of maintenance, and curtailment of needed expansion. These services were surpassed by other national priorities, which resulted in a serious degradation of the quality and extent of services delivered. Diseases associated with poor sanitation, unsafe water, and unhygienic practices had increased to alarming rates. For the purpose of this study, samples were collected from eight stations along the Tigris River. The major sources of data are the Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Water Resources.

823,"Due to the IT advances, the logistics management faces a change to the new era. This article proposes a novel method to evaluate the real-time overall performance of a logistics network for a supply chain. The corresponding strategies to manage the underperformed channels can be subsequently obtained in the method. Thus, the logistics network can be managed timely under the stochastic environment, and it makes the SCM robust. The overall performance of the logistics network is integrated by the individual logistics channel real-time performance which can be easily obtained by the new IT technologies such as RFID, etc. The fuzzy-scorecard is introduced to indicate the measured key performance indicators (KPI) for the network. Some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the various scenarios of management for the proposed method. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

824,"The knowledge-based bio-economy has gained prominence as a research and innovation policy of the European Union. As a policy framework the knowledge-based bio-economy has attracted two contending visions, which can be analyzed as imaginaries - strategic discourses prefiguring a possible, desirable future. In the dominant vision, life sciences will enhance productivity for European competitive advantage in global value chains. A rival vision links agroecology and shorter food supply chains, as a means for farmers to gain more from the value that they add. Each vision favors a different diagnosis of unsustainable agriculture and eco-efficient remedies. Each extends a different paradigm of agri-innovation, foreseeing an economic community that can gain from future markets. These two contending visions give different meanings to the same key terms - knowledge, biological resources and economy. In the EU's research program for a knowledge-based bio-economy, a life sciences vision dominates the priorities, though agroecology has also gained a significant place in response to proposals from stakeholder networks.

It differs from the existing vertical supply chain federation (VSCF) models in terms of establishing federation and dynamic pricing. There is a need to develop algorithms that can capture this complexity and used to solve distributed VM allocation problem in HDCF platform. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic solution to this problem that ensures mutual benefits to the CPs in a HDCF platform. We study two resource allocation games - non cooperative and cooperative games to analyze interaction among CPs in HDCF environment. We use price-based resource allocation strategies and present both centralized and distributed algorithms to find optimal solutions which have low overhead and robust performance. Various simulations were carried out to validate and verify the effectiveness of the proposed resource allocation games.

829,"Copyright © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd. Over the past decade, the concepts of supply chain risk and supply chain risk management (SCRM) have grown in importance. These concepts have become prerequisite to the development of sustainable supply chain. Managing risks effectively in today’s complicated and long supply networks requires well focused efforts as disruption in the supply chain needs to be avoided or at least mitigated. Risk distribution is a risk management strategy which has been used to manage risks in other fields such as finance and law. However, a review of the supply chain literature observed that there is a lack of references related to risk distribution strategy in supply chains. This paper therefore tries to address this significant gap by defining the risk distribution concept, and by positioning risk distribution as part of supply chain strategy. A description of the risk distribution concept in other academic fields as well as an understanding of its characteristics derived from the literature is presented. These characteristics form the main elements of risk distribution that can be applied to supply chain management and enable the supply chain to become more sustainable.",10.1504/IJASM.2012.045897,International Journal of Agile Systems and Management,Literature review | Risk | Risk distribution | Risk management strategy | SCRM | Supply chain | Supply chain risk management,85032862961,Conceptualising risk distribution for supply chain sustainability,2012.0

At the same line, this paper presents an efficient mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that is able to consider the key characteristics of agile supply chain, which is the best competitive strategy for high turbulent environments, such as direct shipments, outsourcing, different transportation modes, discount, alliance (process and information integration) between opened facilities and maximum waiting time of customers for deliveries. Additionally, the robust stochastic programming approach is applied to handle both operational and disruption risks of the agile supply chain network.

832,"Fishing effort reduction forced by the new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) designed to achieve sustainable stock levels has caused a fall-off in the incomes of fishermen and coastal communities. These events are particularly dramatic for the small pelagic fish market, which is characterized by low prices, a low level of consumption and poor market penetration. This paper evaluates the value of the social capital network as substance of relationships among the Adriatic small pelagic fish (Engraulis encrasicolus anchovies, Sardina pilchardus sardines and Scomber scombrus mackerel) supply chain actors; starting from the definition of each marketplace role and commercial flows, the paper defines the supply chain value-system and the possibility to enhance the fishery's share value, according to increasing relationships. Applied approach of the value chain to different supply chains of the Adriatic fishery system made it possible to estimate value distribution among the phases of the chain and to understand the fishery firms' competitive position. Critical aspects causing fishing firms' low profitability were detected and analyzed through the Social Network Analysis (SNA). Five local small pelagic fishery systems (Manfredonia, Molfetta, Ancona, Martinsicuro and Chioggia) were studied. For each of them, small pelagic fish supply chains were defined with particular reference to the role of local fish marketplaces and operators involved. Analysis of production areas revealed profound differences both in structural aspects (fleet composition, vessels, type and structure of local fish markets, fish ranges and prices) and in the business relations and management of supply chain dealers.",,New Medit,Small pelagic fish supply chain | Social network analysis | Value system,84862082768,The social capital for adriatic small pelagic fish value-enhancing: A network analysis,2012.0
833,"Consider a supplier who is concerned with choosing a contract offered to the retailer. In addition to a wholesale price, the supplier looks for additional contract levers to improve performance. The three commonly used levers are inventory buyback, fixed payment and revenue sharing. This paper shows that the effectiveness of each of these contracts depends critically on the presence of three characteristics that define the complexity of the operating environment: demand uncertainty, demand price-sensitivity and information asymmetry. When the complexity is only about demand uncertainty, it is known that any of the three contracts can be utilised effectively by the supplier to extract all the first-best channel profit. When price-sensitivity of demand is added to the complexity, both revenue sharing and fixed payment remain perfectly effective. Inventory buyback, however, becomes a useless contract lever. We show that when the system is further complicated with information asymmetry, revenue sharing continues to be (almost) perfectly effective and inventory return stays to be useless. On the other hand, fixed payment proves to be useful, allowing the supplier to improve performance, but not to the degree of achieving first-best channel profit. © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",10.1504/IJOR.2012.049481,International Journal of Operational Research,Contracting | Endogenous pricing | Game theory | Supply chain management,84867468140,"Contract efficiency: Demand uncertainty, price sensitivity and information asymmetry",2012.0
834,"This article investigates the robustness of different tactical planning and control policies for a softwood supply chain using an agent-based environment that simulates a distributed advanced planning and scheduling system and its corresponding supply chain operations. Simulations were modelled using a novel agent-based methodology combined with a robust experimental design approach and an industrial data set obtained from two companies in Eastern Canada. Experimental results provide insights about the dynamic relations among factors related to control levels, planning methods and planning horizon lengths. Results indicate that supply chain control levels play a relevant role in defining robust service levels, while the planning horizon and the planning method have lower impact in this context. In addition, from the supply chain inventory level point of view, we verified that the three investigated tactical rules have to be configured together if one desires to maximise their contribution for a robust supply chain system capable of coping with uncertainties from the business environment. When these rules are evaluated individually, it is not possible to make the most of their potential due to interactions between them. The article concludes by proposing an optimum robust configuration of the tactical rules to minimise the impact of supply chain uncertainties. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",10.1080/09537287.2010.543561,Production Planning and Control,Agent-based simulation | Robust design | Softwood lumber industry | Supply chain management | Tactical planning,84855758512,Agent-based experimental investigations of the robustness of tactical planning and control policies in a softwood lumber supply chain,2011.0
835,"In today's global business environment, supply chains have increased in both length and complexity. This increase in length and complexity coupled with a focus on improving efficiency, such as lean manufacturing practices, may lead to higher levels of supply chain risk where the likelihood of a disruption severely impacting supply chain performance increases. Resilient supply chains have been touted as a means to reduce the likelihood and severity of supply chain disruptions. However, there is little empirical evidence relative to the factors that contribute to or detract from supply resiliency. Using systems theory and the resource-based view of the firm as the theoretical underpinnings, this study provides an in-depth systematic investigation of supply resiliency. Adopting a theory-building approach based on a multi-industry empirical investigation, this study derives empirical generalizations linking 19 supply chain characteristics to supply resiliency. The study culminates in a framework that could be used to assess the level of resiliency in a supply base. Building on this framework, the study also provides a supply resiliency matrix that can be utilized to classify supply chains, or supply chains segments according to the level of resiliency realized.

836,"The need for integrated methodological framework for sustainability assessment has been widely discussed and is urgent due to increasingly complex environmental system problems. These problems have impacts on ecosystems and human well-being which represent a threat to economic performance of countries and corporations. Integrated assessment crosses issues; spans spatial and temporal scales; looks forward and backward; and incorporates multi-stakeholder inputs. This study aims to develop an integrated methodology by capitalizing the complementary strengths of different methods used by industrial ecologists and biophysical economists. The computational methodology proposed here is systems perspective, integrative, and holistic approach for sustainability assessment which attempts to link basic science and technology to policy formulation. The framework adopts life cycle thinking methods-LCA, LCC, and SLCA; stakeholders analysis supported by multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA); and dynamic system modelling. Following Pareto principle, the critical sustainability criteria, indicators and metrics (i.e., hotspots) can be identified and further modelled using system dynamics or agent based modelling and improved by data envelopment analysis (DEA) and sustainability network theory (SNT).

837,"This paper reviews existing literature to determine the drivers of and barriers to Enterprise Resource Planning II (ERPII) implementation. The ERPII literature is then extended through interviews with potential players in ERPII implementations to identify the critical success factors (CSFs) or preconditions required for successful implementation throughout supply chains. These interviews were conducted with leading ERP vendors/consultants and organisations involved in the entire supply chain to gather evidence on the success, or lack thereof, of ERPII implementations. The results were compared and contrasted to existing literature on ERPII, collaborative networks, and the extended enterprise. We found more barriers to than drivers of successful ERPII implementation. This leads prospective implementers to have a pessimistic forecast for ERPII implementation success. Our research reveals that main reason for this negativity is a general lack of understanding and appreciation of the capabilities of the extended enterprise network. Second, the research presents two sets of CSFs: CSFs which apply to traditional ERP and carry forward to apply to ERPII, and CSFs that are tailored to the new needs for successful ERPII implementations. Finally, the research questions the suitability of ERPII in today's modern business environment, and suggests that technology may have overtaken management's capabilities to capture the full benefits of such an advanced enterprise system. Future trends in ERPII development are also considered in an attempt to find the next phase in the enterprise system life cycle. Beyond ERPII, the research suggests that infrastructure such as large-scale business intelligence (BI) systems must be heavily incorporated into modern enterprise systems to fully understand how information flows throughout an organisation and to make sense of that information. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

839,"The inherent and growing complexity characterizing today's infrastructure systems has considerably increased their vulnerability to external disruptions. Recent world events have demonstrated how damage to one or more infrastructure components can result in disastrous political, social, and economic effects. This, in turn, has fostered the development of sophisticated quantitative methods that identify cost-effective ways of strengthening supply systems in the face of disruption. Stochastic and robust optimization can be used to tackle these strategic problems when uncertainty is present. The uncertainty dealt with in this article is related to the extent to which supply systems can be disrupted. More specifically, we propose and analyze different protection optimization models for minimizing the damage to a system resulting from the disruption of an uncertain number of system components. We compare a cost-based model and two original regret models that, to the best of our knowledge, represent the state of the art in the field of protection in location analysis. Also, we discuss how to build an operational envelope for the models considered, which can be used to identify the range of possible impacts associated with different protection strategies.

840,"Growing concerns about the environment make a supply chains' eco-footprint increasingly important, presuming that footprints are a more effective (policy) instrument than those currently in use. The eco-footprint comprises all kinds of environmental impact, but often is narrowed down to one aspect; e.g. the carbon footprint, material footprint, the water footprint, and so on. Although returns give rise to an additional goods flow from customers back to producers, it usually improves the eco-footprint due to the substitution effect. The reverse channel supplies high quality (recovered) products, components and materials to the forward channel thereby reducing the need for virgin sourcing and production. We refer to this as closed-loop recovery, as opposed to recovery for cascade markets which lacks substitution. To maximize substitution, the recovered items must re-enter the original supply chain. The feasibility of closed-loop recovery depends partly on the geographical proximity of forward and reverse facilities. We develop a decision framework for optimizing closed loop network configurations, i.e. the combined disposition and location-transport decision. We apply the framework to a single case study concerning one type of footprint (namely the carbon footprint) of a copier (closed-loop) supply chain. The main implication is that a regional network, with combined forward and reverse facilities per continent, proves most efficient and most robust in view of uncertain exogenous variables, but only when a full set of closed-loop options is available (including closed-loop recycling). As an embedded case, main contribution value of it lies in the discovery of a new phenomenon with generic implications; namely that not only the closed-loop supply chains footprint strongly depends on the substitution effect, but that in turn the feasibility of closed-loop recovery options depends heavily on the network design.

842,"Providing food, energy and materials for the rising global population is a challenge which is compounded by increased pressure on natural resources such as land, water and fossil sources of raw materials. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human activities have increased with industrial development and population expansion, and it is anticipated that resulting climate change might further limit agricultural productivity, through changes to weather patterns and global availability/distribution of agriculturally productive land. Growing crops as feedstocks for industrial uses is seen as one way of reducing GHG emissions and dependency on fossil resources. However, determining the extent to which the development of crops for industrial use will effect GHG balances and provide for a more energy efficient manufacturing system requires the development and use of appropriate calculation methodologies.Research at the Porter Institute has identified over 250 different scenarios for bioenergy production systems using commodity crops. In order to rationalise this complexity and diversity, a modular approach to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and sustainability analysis has been taken. This allows characterisation of discrete sections of supply chains and enables comparisons to be made between different crop production systems, different process systems and different end product uses. The purposes of this paper are to introduce the concepts of biofuel GHG and sustainability metrics, to introduce the approach taken by our organization and to use the example of UK grown willow in a lignocellulosic ethanol production system to demonstrate how GHG emission outcomes can be reviewed for "" new"" crops and technologies.The results show a range of variation, in both growing and process systems and how outcomes such as energy and GHG balances can be affected by various activities.LCA methodologies provide data to inform governments and industry of the potential specific supply chains may have for energy and GHG saving. However, methodological approaches can also affect assessment outcomes. Unresolved issues in LCA methodology must also be evaluated e.g. impacts resulting from land use change. Sustainability assessments of crop growing systems, irrespective of the end use, also assist in the assessment of environmental impacts of supply chains. However, it is critical that data continue to be collected, analysed and reviewed, to ensure that the most appropriate crops are grown and processed for the most appropriate end use. © 2011.",10.1016/j.indcrop.2010.12.002,Industrial Crops and Products,Advanced biofuel technology | Greenhouse gas (GHG) | Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) | Lignocellulosic ethanol | Sustainability | Willow,79958759380,"Life Cycle Assessment and sustainability methodologies for assessing industrial crops, processes and end products",2011.0

This study addresses a new mathematical robust model for a cellular manufacturing problem integrated with tactical aspects under supply chain network characteristics in the presence of uncertain internal parameter (processing times) and external parameter (demands). The model aims to minimize total cost consisting expected value and variance of tactical cost (scheduling), strategic cost (employment of suppliers in supply chain network) to produce exceptional elements as well as the cost of resource underutilization. The model can give up a series of the solutions that are less sensitive to the changes in input data.

844,"The aim of this Nakhon Pathom area-based research was to develop a rice communication model as well as a research and management strategy in relation to the rice commodity supply chain. Data were collected from purposively selected samples consisting of 30 marketing-based and 40 sufficiency-based rice farmers, 6 rice-millers and 4 rice modifying industrial managers which were purposively and snowball selected. Data collection techniques involved documentary investigation along with a field study involving a questionnaire, interviews and observation. Analysis on knowledge status and gaps was conducted. The preliminary findings were then presented to a forum of 47 key participants to secure reflections and recommendations from the stakeholders in the rice commodity chain. Rice production in Nakhon Pathom province is predominantly marketing-based, with an exportoriented aim. Regarding the knowledge status, it was evident that the farmers were knowledgeable and skillful in rice production due to the availability of knowledge from local research and extension organizations. The farmers were able to apply the existing knowledge and also to advance it further in practice. Regarding the knowledge gap, the farmers needed more technical knowledge and systematic management that could directly solve emerging production problems. More efficient rice mechanization was also needed to suit local rice fields. For the rice agro-industry, marketing support for new products was needed. Most importantly, knowledge on quality and sustainable rice seed production was critically lacking among farmers. Communication of knowledge on rice production to farmers must take into account the holistic realm of production problems. As such, the researchers proposed an integrated model for rice communication and development.

845,"Climate change is predicted to have major impacts on small-scale farmers in Mexico whose livelihoods depend on rain-fed maize. We examined the capacity of traditional maize seed systems to provide these farmers with appropriate genetic material under predicted agro-ecological conditions associated with climate change. We studied the structure and spatial scope of seed systems of 20 communities in four transects across an altitudinal gradient from 10-2,980 m above sea level in five states of eastern Mexico. Results indicate that 90% of all of the seed lots are obtained within 10 km of a community and 87% within an altitudinal range of ±50 m but with variation across four agro-climate environments: wet lowland, dry lowland, wet upper midlatitude, and highlands. Climate models suggest a drying and warming trend for the entire study area during the main maize season, leading to substantial shifts in the spatial distribution patterns of agro-climate environments. For all communities except those in the highlands, predicted future maize environments already are represented within the 10-km radial zones, indicating that in the future farmers will have easy access to adapted planting material. Farmers in the highlands are the most vulnerable and probably will need to acquire seed fromoutside their traditional geographical ranges. This change in seed sources probably will entail important information costs and the development of new seed and associated social networks, including improved linkages between traditional and formal seed systems and more effective and efficient seed-supply chains.

846,"Engineering changes to products aim to correct design faults, exploit new market opportunities, improve overall product performance, or reduce production costs. These changes are thus considered as opportunities to stay competitive in the market place and companies strive to implement them in their products at the lowest possible costs. Such engineering changes in a collaborative environment require the original equipment manufacturer to work together with suppliers for designing, manufacturing, and marketing a product profitably. Simulation of an engineering change management process provides an understanding of important factors affecting the engineering change management process and helps in identifying any critical components of the entire process.

To address the complexity of the models, several standard templates have been developed and used. © 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited.",10.1007/s00170-010-3143-z,International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,Collaborative networks | Engineering change management | Modeling and simulation | New product development | System dynamics,79961020476,System dynamics modeling of engineering change management in a collaborative environment,2011.0
847,Any decision a company takes concerning the global expansion of its value network has major economic implications and is highly complex. Many diverse aspects must be taken into consideration when such a decision is made to ensure that a robust network is configured which will allow the company to be economically successful in the future in spite of the volatile environment it is affected by. It is against this context that the LMP and the wbk jointly developed a decision support method for the configuration and evaluation of the global expansion of value networks. The successful implementation and application of the approach are shown on the basis of a practical case study. © 2011 CIRP.,10.1016/j.cirpj.2011.06.012,CIRP Journal of Manufacturing Science and Technology,Decision making | Global production | Global sourcing | Value-added network,82955162973,Supply chain design for the global expansion of manufacturing capacity in emerging markets,2011.0
848,"We are witnessing an explosion in carbon calculators for estimating the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (i.e., carbon footprint) of households, buildings, cities, and processes. Seeking to capitalize on the emergent ""green"" consumer, corporations are leading the next iteration in carbon footprinting: consumer products. This potentially lucrative low-carbon frontier, however, faces steep challenges due to complexities of scale, largely a function of the number of actors and geographies involved in globalized commodity and energy networks, and scope, which increasingly demands inclusion of emissions due to land use change (e.g., bio fuel production, timber harvest, livestock grazing, mining). Life cycle assessment (LCA)-the principal method behind product level GHG emissions footprint protocols-frequently avoids these challenges by narrowly delineating system boundaries, thereby excluding the ""messiness"" of space and place. Through a comparative model of energy sources and emissions in the globalized paper industry, this article reveals how complexities associated with geographic variation and land use change create indeterminacy in footprints based on these protocols. Using industry and trade data, the authors develop geographic information system transportation and energy models to map the globally dispersed pulp supply networks and to rescale Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change GHG inventory guidelines to include carbon loss associated with land use change in the carbon footprint of coated paper. Given their integrative abilities to conceptualize and model coupled human-ecological systems, sophisticated understanding of time-space dynamics and critical theoretical insights, geographers have much to contribute to the LCA and product carbon footprinting enterprise, which to date has been largely the intellectual domain of engineers. © 2011 by Association of American Geographers.",10.1080/00045608.2011.567929,Annals of the Association of American Geographers,Carbon labels | Emissions | Land use change | Life cycle assessment | Paper industry,79958703036,"""Papering"" over space and place: Product carbon footprint modeling in the global paper industry",2011.0

Study level/applicability: Master's courses: Entrepreneurship, Strategic management. Case overview: In 2002, potential risks deriving from emerging normative demands in the CSR debate prompted Axel Springer (AS) to rethink their supply chain strategy for Russian wood. Being one of the first movers in CSR in the publishing business, AS realized that current practices could spark future public discussion that might put pressure on AS, a key player in these supply chains. In early 2002, AS and one of their main suppliers, Stora Enso, started a joint initiative to redesign the supply chain processes in two of the major Russian logging regions to improve their social and ecological performance. Sometime later, other major players in the publishing sector as well as critical reviewers from several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were invited to participate in the design of the new voluntary sustainability initiative called “Tikhvin Chalna project”, the second phase of which was accomplished by the end of 2006. outcomes: Learn that organizations (specifically high-brand owners) are responsible for practices within their entire supply chains (social as well as environmental performance).

850,"Purpose: The intent of the paper is to develop the Service Marketing Logic (S-D Logic) strategy that is centered on service as a means to differentiate global strategy from those of competitors. The context of the paper is to examine S-D logical in global supply chains. Design/Methodology: The paper is a theory driven conceptual piece. Findings: Globalization emphasizes complex interconnected systems, while S-D Logic emphasizes the importance of leveraging operant resources in order to achieve sustainable competitive advantage. Both S-D Logic and globalization apply in the supply chain context. This paper focuses on the global supply chain and the importance of leveraging service based operant resources. Because the focus of management has shifted from a domestic to a more complex, three-dimensional network, it is critical for practitioners and researchers to understand how to optimize service based operant resources in the global marketplace. Practical Implications: Because the focus of management has shifted from a domestic to a more complex, three-dimensional global network, it is critical for practitioners and researchers to understand how to optimize service based operant resources in the global marketplace. We suggest that in this dynamic marketplace, both globalization and S-D logic are required to fully explain supply chain performance. Specifically, we suggest that managers develop a global 'supply-chain management' perspective allowing for the key operant resource - human capital -- to create synergistic partner relationships and customer experiences resulting in superior performance. Originality/Value: This is one of the first (if not the first) paper that examines S-D Logic in a global context.

851,"The purpose of this paper is to aid just-in-time (JIT) manufacturers in selecting the most appropriate suppliers and in evaluating supplier performance. Many manufacturers employ the JIT philosophy in order to be more competitive in today's global market. The success of JIT on the production floor has led many firms to expand the JIT philosophy to the entire supply chain. The procurement of parts and materials is a very important issue in the successful and effective implementation of JIT; thus, supplier selection and performance evaluation in long-term relationships have became more critical in JIT production environments. The proposed systems can assist manufacturers in handling these issues. In this research, neural network based supplier selection and supplier performance evaluation systems are presented. The proposed approach is not limited to JIT supply. It can assist manufacturers in selecting the most appropriate suppliers and in evaluating supplier performance. The proposed neural network based systems are tested with data taken from an automotive factory, and the results show that the proposed systems can be used effectively. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

852,"Purpose: The European Union (EU) energy supply environment is changing significantly and in a dynamic way, establishing the issue of safe energy imports as main priority. Greece relies heavily on energy imports. Furthermore, Greece aims to be elevated into an energy cross road for the energy supply to the EU. In this respect, the aim of this paper is the investigation of the suitability of graph theory concepts on energy supply networks and its application to represent energy corridors to Greece. Design/methodology/approach: Supporting frameworks to represent and assess the vulnerability of the corridors satisfying the Greek demand in oil and gas are considered a crucial issue and are presented in this paper, based on the graph theory approach. In addition, a pilot application of the shortest path algorithm and the maximum flow at minimum risk algorithm for the oil and gas corridors to Greece is presented and discussed. Findings: This paper introduces the application of graph theory to energy policy analysis. Indeed, the pilot application in oil and gas supply corridors to Greece, although quite simplified, has indicated the applicability of graph theory concepts in such problems and is considered a step forward of the existing studies, supporting the design efforts towards the development of a more reliable energy supply system. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, graph theory's application to energy corridors is not available in the international literature. In this respect, the added value of the paper is the provision of a sufficient decision support framework for the representation and assessment of the energy corridors' risk of energy availability, through the application of graph theory. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",10.1108/17506221111120901,International Journal of Energy Sector Management,Energy industry | Graph theory | Greece,79955685392,Graph theory-based approach for energy corridors network to Greece,2011.0
853,"Various disasters with serious results are reported and happen around our lives. Most of them are unconventional contingency events. Emergency relief is an important activity dealing with the disasters to transfer a large number of materials to the destroyed places for casualties and reconstruction for the country, even the world. Container multimodal transportation will play an important role because of its superior characteristics. The relations in the process of supply and transportation build up the container supply chain. It is critical to schedule the multimodal transportation flow of the chain with time efficiency of higher reliability. In this study, the system of container multimodal transportation emergency relief is modeled as an affinity network inspired by the immune system. An integer linear programming model is proposed to build the path selection for container supply chain in the context of emergency relief. The simulation study shows the promising effects of the model. The study is valuable for designing the emergency logistics management system with optimal path selection and flow design of container supply chain in disaster environments. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Consumer, supply chain and network analyses are critical to finding an optimal solution that is sustainable enough to meet the changing environment. Industry-specific information regarding the structure and function of the beef value chain was gathered through interviews with industry leaders and experts; and specific consumer information was gathered through a consumer survey. The South African beef industry, like many other South African supply chains, is challenged by the increasing complexity and demand brought about by globalisation, increased volumes and competition, the shortage of skilled staff and pressures to meet changing customer needs. Consequently, the power has shifted from the supply side to the consumer.

855,"The concern about significant changes in the business environment (such as customer demands and transportation costs) has spurred an interest in designing scalable and robust supply chains. This paper proposes a robust optimization model for handling the inherent uncertainty of input data in a closed-loop supply chain network design problem. First, a deterministic mixed-integer linear programming model is developed for designing a closed-loop supply chain network. Then, the robust counterpart of the proposed mixed-integer linear programming model is presented by using the recent extensions in robust optimization theory. Finally, to assess the robustness of the solutions obtained by the novel robust optimization model, they are compared to those generated by the deterministic mixed-integer linear programming model in a number of realizations under different test problems. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.apm.2010.07.013,Applied Mathematical Modelling,Closed-loop supply chain network | Reverse logistics | Robust optimization,77956182227,A robust optimization approach to closed-loop supply chain network design under uncertainty,2011.0
856,"In this work, we propose a single period stochastic inventory decision-making model that captures the trade-off between inventory policies and disruption risks for unreliable (both uncapacitated and capacitated) dual-sourcing reverse supply chain networks. Risk-management has emerged high at the corporate agenda as globalised supply chain networks are more stretched than ever due to offshoring and thus are more exposed to disruptions, while reverse logistics has been proven to constitute a profit center. In this environment, global companies have to scrutinize especially the role of major Asian economies (with large manufacturing capacities and huge markets), while conducting their strategic procurement planning. The developed model can be applied to a number of different scenario types encompassing various instances of disruptions to the collection of the end-of-life products, of the transportation system, and of the remanufacturing yield and capacity. Analytical closed-form solutions are obtained and important managerial insights on the merit of contingency strategies in managing uncertainties for reverse logistics networks are discussed. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Co. & Operational Research Society of Singapore.",10.1142/S0217595911003090,Asia-Pacific Journal of Operational Research,inventory policies | Reverse logistics | sourcing decisions | stochastic modeling | supply chain disruptions | supply chain management,79952051163,Optimal sourcing decisions for unreliable reverse supply chains,2011.0

This paper explores the planning process for adaptation strategies, emphasizing current research and modelling constraints and comparing resilience strategies. The flood hazard, vulnerability and impact were assessed based on information provided by the Environment Agency, local knowledge and network modelling of outages. Improvements in flood estimation were suggested to extend the range of scenarios analysed and the geographic cover and scope of models, whilst reducing and quantifying associated uncertainty. For evaluating consequences of widespread flooding, information on joint flood probabilities would be relevant, particularly where sites are interconnected. Considering the uncertainties in the approach, two strategies were explored to manage the flood risk, i.e. enhanced asset and system resilience. Low-regret options designed to protect a site from flooding were chosen and, where the population at risk is high, those were complemented with long term strategies for increased robustness of supply network to a multiplicity of risks. © 2011 IWA Publishing.",10.2166/aqua.2011.070,Journal of Water Supply: Research and Technology - AQUA,Adaptation | Asset management | Flood mitigation | Flood risk | Resilience | Water supply network,79251476887,Practical Paper Alleviating the flood risk of critical water supply sites: Asset and system resilience,2011.0
858,"Rapid changes and complexities in business environments have stressed the importance of interactions between partners and competitors, leading supply chains to become the most important element of contemporary business environments. There is a concomitant need for foresight in describing supply chain performance in all operating environments, including those involving punctuated disruptions. Furthermore, the urban metropolis is now widely recognized to be an environment which is especially vulnerable to supply chain disruptions and for which integrated supply chain decisions can produce very substantial net benefits. Accordingly, this paper presents a dynamic supply chain network model formulated as a differential variational inequality; the model is fashioned to allow consideration of supply chain disruption threats to producers, freight carriers, and retail enterprises. The DVI is solved using a fixed-point algorithm, and a simple numerical example, introduced to illustrate how the impacts of supply chain disruptions may be quantified, is presented. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.trb.2011.05.005,Transportation Research Part B: Methodological,City logistics | Differential variational inequalities | Disruptions | Dynamic supply chains | Supply chain networks | Urban supply chains,80051951647,Competition and disruption in a dynamic urban supply chain,2011.0
859,"Despite the potential benefits the Internet and other related technologies offer, current supply chain management techniques do not take full advantage of these benefits. E-business environments provide a facilitating infrastructure for solving the issues concerning the traditional supply chain, such as the scalability and flexibility for the efficient collaboration between partners. Both internal and external uncertainties to the supply chain can hinder collaboration between partners, and thus also hinder their ability to achieve their best possible performance. This research proposes using agent-based web services to better support collaboration within a supply chain. An advantage of agent-based web services is that they combine the strengths of both web services and multi-agents. Two different collaboration situations are used in order to demonstrate the flexibility of the system. Scalability is demonstrated when the supply chain faces changes in the partnership candidates. Simulation methods are used in order to validate the feasibility of this approach, and statistical tests reveal the robustness of the experimental results across diverse uncertainties. © 2012 Sharif University of Technology.

Supply chain is a network of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers that act together to control, manage, and improve the overall supply chain performance. The most important and critical part of decision making is identifying the different sides of supply chain's performance. Evaluating the performance of the whole supply chain is a complex task, due to the complexity inherent in the structure and operations of the supply chain. This study presents a suggestion for a comprehensive system to evaluate the performance of the supply chain in eight dimensions (i.e., financial, customer, internal operations, learning and growth, people, environmental, and political perspectives).

861,"Competitive pressure forces companies to exert themselves in order to survive and to grow. When competition is intense, only excellent companies are positioned to survive. Competitive excellence derives from managerial excellence which has turned to the creation of world-class supply chain operations, along with its philosophies, approaches, tools and technologies to assure excellence. Even though talk of protectionism has surfaced with the strains of the downturn in the world economy, globalisation has changed the fabric of competition in the market and has imposed new and more exacting requirements on companies and their supply chains. In the global market, a company must achieve excellence on five critical competitive requirements, namely on quality, cost, flexibility, innovation and customer service, creating a compelling paradigm by which supply chain operations will be judged. This paper explores how companies can pursue competitive excellence in their supply chain, and thereby gain a global mindset, rapid response time and sustainable competitive performance. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",10.1504/IJSEM.2011.039431,"International Journal of Services, Economics and Management",global business | global networks | supply chain management,84952964967,Competitive excellence in the global supply chain,2011.0
862,"Biofuels supply chain comprises a wide set of activities involving a rather complex set of parameters. Cultivation of the raw materials is closely related to the agricultural sector whereas the production of the final product presumes the operation of a conversion plant. The distribution network aims at delivering the final product close to the consumption. The extent of the involvement of each one of the previously mentioned sectors is the result of strategic and operational planning of the whole supply chain and, in the general case, determines the efficiency of the biofuels sector. Taking also into account the very rapidly changing opinions related to the environmental behaviour of the whole biofuels supply chain, it becomes very clear that the parameters in the sector are continuously changing. Therefore, the consideration of an integrated supply chain appropriately modelled is believed to be very critical and could result in the optimal solution per case, economically and/or environmentally speaking. In this paper the development of a mathematical model for the optimal design and operation of Biofuels Supply Chain is proposed as an integrated approach that can take into account both technical and economic parameters affecting the performance of the whole value chain. Model implementation would facilitate and support the decision taking in various planning and operational issues such as infrastructure investments, the quantities of raw materials to be cultivated, the quantities of biofuels to be produced in the domestic market or imported, identifying the best available solution for the optimal design and operation of the biofuels supply chain. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.energy.2011.08.013,Energy,Biodiesel conversion | Integrated biofuels planning | Transportation fuels,80053448022,Development and implementation of an optimisation model for biofuels supply chain,2011.0
863,"The advances in information technology have prompted the development of many supply chain information-sharing strategies, including electronic point of sales (EPOS), vendor-managed inventory (VMI), e-shopping, emergency transshipments, and so on. However, variations in the business environment can produce uncertainty and increase decision-making complexity for enterprises selecting from various supply chain information-sharing strategies. An effective and efficient supply chain strategy should be capable of reducing costs and raising customer-service levels, and should be capable of enhancing the robustness of the supply chain. In this study, the robustness of different supply chain strategies under various uncertain environments is studied using the simulated beer game. Techniques included Taguchi methodology and multiple criteria decision-making methods (MCDMs), including simple multiple attribute rating technology (SMART), technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), and grey relational analysis (GRA). The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio for each criterion is calculated to indicate the robustness of performance. This S/N ratio is used to determine an overall evaluation among various supply chain information-sharing strategies.

We determine a new metric, 'SC adaptation potential', and propose a method for its assessment based on the system entropy. This makes it possible to integrate the analysis of SC structure complexity and adaptability. Consequently, we consider the usage of adaptation potential for SC structuring. The adaptation potential can be used as an additional indicator to select a SC configuration. The analysis of adaptation potential makes it possible to take the decisions on the determination of a number of elements in a SC, their variety, and the interrelations between them with regard to the potential ability SC to adapt SC structurally in order to ensure flexibility and resilience.

865,"Globalisation presents business organisations with some special challenges that they have never met before; they have to manage their activities in the ambit of global supply chain networks. Traditional managerial approaches, techniques and principles are no longer effective in dealing with these challenges. This article examines logistics and inventory problems in a supply chain operating in two countries where decisions have to be made with uncertain customer information. There are some differentials between two countries in terms of vehicle operation cost and capacity, labour cost, warehousing cost, etc. This article proposes three different types of robust models to integrate logistics and inventory processes between the two counties for coping with uncertain customer shipment information and the risk it entails. The first model is called the robust optimisation model with solution robustness, which provides an integrated logistics and inventory solution that is less sensitive to realisations of stochastic parameters. The second type of model is called the robust optimisation model with model robustness allowing late delivery (if it is profitable). The third type of model is called the robust optimisation model with trade-off between solution robustness and model robustness. It provides a direct way to measure the trade-off between risk and cost during the international transportation process. A series of experiments demonstrate that the proposed robust models can provide effective integrated logistics and inventory systems between two countries, which is important in today's highly competitive and dynamic business environment. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",10.1080/0951192X.2011.554875,International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing,global supply chain | international logistics | inventory | road transport | robust optimisation,79953003182,Linear robust models for international logistics and inventory problems under uncertainty,2011.0
866,"Purpose: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been identified as one of Unilever's priority environmental impact themes: this assessment was therefore conducted to help the Knorr brand measure and understand the GHG emissions related to its product portfolio, identify opportunities to manage GHG emissions in the Unilever-owned operations (manufacture) and influence managed reductions elsewhere in the Knorr product lifecycles, and assess the impact of the brand's innovation and portfolio strategies on its GHG footprint. Methods: A bottom-up product-based life cycle assessment (LCA) approach was considered impractical to assess Knorr's portfolio's complexity. Thus, a meta-product-based accounting LCA approach was followed (Milà i Canals et al. 2009). Up to 16 product types or ""meta-products"" were assessed in each geographical region, with a total of 36 meta-products assessed globally. Then, the Knorr GHG footprint was derived by multiplying the impacts calculated per tonne of each product type with the sales volumes in 2007. Data for ingredients and processing technologies were gathered from the literature and suppliers; data from Knorr factories were used for the manufacturing stage. The variability in ingredients' production and processing and in manufacture was factored in and propagated through the calculations to assess the robustness of the results. Results: The profiles of different meta-products within a product group (e.g. dry soups) follow similar patterns in terms of absolute GHG per tonne and distribution of such emissions along the life cycle. Variations are observed due to recipe composition and electricity mixes in the different regions. The range of variability around absolute results is significant and varies between meta-products. Aggregating the results for individual meta-products with their production volumes, the global Knorr brand GHG footprint in 2007 was estimated to be in the region of 3-5 million tonnes CO2e/annum (95% confidence interval). In spite of the significant variability ranges found, the results are useful for target setting and identification of opportunities for improvement. Conclusions: This is the world's first life cycle GHG assessment at brand's product portfolio level. The meta-product approach simultaneously allows for the assessment and comparison of individual product types as well as for the estimation of a brand's total GHG. The variability assessment enhanced robustness of the results by identifying a confidence range; given the complexity of the studied supply chains and the current data quality translated in wide confidence ranges, single number on-pack carbon labels seem questionable and not robust enough to inform consumers. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/s11367-010-0239-5,International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,Bouillons | Greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint | Knorr | Meta-product | Soups,79951683408,Estimating the greenhouse gas footprint of Knorr,2011.0
867,"Purchasing order methods and inventory control are vital elements in fulfilling customer orders and building internal performance; this is particularly the case in retailing operations. In this manuscript, we develop different scenarios for various order methods for a wood retailer, where the performance of the different methods is evaluated through simulation, whereupon the fit between environments and methods is compared. Our results indicate that only simple environments follow analytical cost and service level calculations, while increasing complexity increases the synchronisation need between forecasts and reordering methods. In our research we also compare different ordering methods, and find that while the reorder point method is the most robust solution from the retailer's perspective, it could lead to distortion within entire wood supply chain.

868,"Expandable cavity sealers have become a critical component of the overall acoustic package that contributes to the documented noise reduction in passenger car applications over the course of the last twenty years. They encompass a variety of technologies, some of which are delivered into the supply chain as bulk materials and others which are highly engineered parts and assemblies. As the market for smaller and more fuel efficient vehicles continues to expand, design architectures of the base vehicle platforms are evolving to include body designs with smaller spaces between adjacent layers of sheet metal. As this space, or cavity, between the adjacent layers of sheet metal is shrinking, the complexity of components that must be integrated into the space between these layers of steel is increasing. Complex arrays of airbags, corresponding wire harnesses, and water management tools are now standard requirements in the design process. To manage the complexity of these lightweight and fuel efficient vehicle architectures, new engineering design solutions are required to meet stringent acoustic requirements. The supply base of acoustic products to the automotive OEMs has also matured over this time period, creating a very competitive environment, both regionally and globally. Design solutions that go beyond the basic functionality of a cavity filler are becoming more common. This paper will evaluate a recent design challenge presented by an OEM to improve visibility for the driver. Here, the hardware to direct water drainage is moved from outside the windshield pillar cavity body metal to inside the cavity metal. A new cavity filler solution is conceptualized to manage this unique packaging and acoustic performance need. Although it's in its infancy, the solution, along with other means of water management, are measured for Insertion Loss and compared. This initial study supports the promise for acoustic performance of a solution that does not exist in the market today.

869,"In this paper, the Inoperability Input-Output Model (IIM) is deployed for assessing the impacts of disruptive events on supply chain networks under an unsafe environment. The IIM for supply chain networks has been proposed, based on the original IIM used in macro-economics. A new method called the OWA (Ordered Weighted Averaging) Operator has been formulated to evaluate the interdependency matrix, a key component of the IIM. Similar to the capability of the basic IIM to describe the propagation impacts of disruptions to macroeconomic systems, the IIM for supply chain networks is capable of describing the propagation effects of disruptions to interdependent supply chain components. IIM assesses the impacts of disruptions to supply chain networks with ""inoperability"" and ""economic losses"" metrics, which can provide helpful insights for risk management of supply chain networks. An example supply chain network is used to illustrate the application of IIM for systemic risk assessment of supply chains under an unsafe environment. A risk mitigation strategy by increasing the number of suppliers has been considered to reduce the adverse effects caused by the supply reduction of the single secondary supplier in the example supply chain network. In addition, a simulation model integrated with Monte Carlo simulation method has been developed to validate the accuracy of the IIM for supply chain. The example shows that the application of IIM can provide useful guidance toward supply chain risk management or mitigation strategies and it could also be used to test the effectiveness of these strategies. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/sys.20153,Systems Engineering,decision analysis | disruptions | inoperability input-output model | robustness metrics | supply chain safety,78649867611,Inoperability input-output modeling (IIM) of disruptions to supply chain networks,2010.0
870,"The supply chain networks could be very fragile in global environment due to unexpected events such as emergencies, normal disruptions and industrial accidents. The supply chain members may lose their production capacities temporarily, which might have significant impacts on the performance of the whole supply chain network. This article proposes a discrete time model to characterise the unreliable production capacity in serial supply chain networks. Based on the proposed model, the exact probability distributions are available for the performance analysis of a single-stage system in the lost sales scenario. The iterative methods are developed to derive the approximate performance measures for single-stage systems in the backorder scenario and multi-stage systems in both the lost sales and backorder scenarios. The proposed methods are verified through a series of numerical experiments. The analysis results suggest that the performance of the supply chain network suffers more from the downstream-stage unreliability than the upstream-stage unreliability. Furthermore, some application examples are illustrated to show the possible solutions for practical problems. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",10.1080/09537281003674222,Production Planning and Control,aggregation | Bernoulli server | discrete time Markov chain | risk | supply chain management,78649512963,Performance analysis of serial supply chain networks considering system disruptions,2010.0
871,"Like many others, Textileapparel companies have to deal with a very competitive environment and have to manage consumers which become more demanding. Thus, to stay competitive, companies rely on sophisticated information systems and logistic skills, and especially accurate and reliable forecasting systems. However, forecasters have to deal with some singular constraints of the textileapparel market such as for instance the volatile demand, the strong seasonality of sales, the wide number of items with short life cycle or the lack of historical data. To respond to these constraints, companies have implemented specific forecasting systems often simple but robust. After the study of existing practices in the clothing industry, we propose different forecasting models which perform more accurate and more reliable sales forecasts. These models rely on advanced methods such as fuzzy logic, neural networks and data mining. In order to evaluate the benefits of these methods for the supply chain and more especially for the reduction of the bullwhip effect, a simulation based on real data of sourcing and forecasting processes is performed and analyzed. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

872,"When environmental problems are the focus, conflicts between the general public and company stakeholders affect both regional and global cooperation prompting conflicts in many areas. As a consequence, various initiatives have been designed and adopted that improve environmental performance while maintaining sustainable development. Green purchasing is applied as a useful tool to mitigate the environmental impacts of consumption and to promote clean production technology. The supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model is proposed by a supply chain council as a standard supply chain performance evaluation model. This model has been widely embraced by many modern organisations. The SCOR model can be applied to analyse supply chain performance in a systematic way. It can also aid in communication among all members in the supply chain, and can assist in the development of a design for a better supply chain network. To further improve the performance of the green purchasing process, which is critical in numerous industries, this study explores the relationship between the plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycle of green purchasing and the SCOR purchasing/sourcing process and its performance indices/metrics. In this study, those companies which produce Taiwanese green label products are taken as samples. The PDSA cycle of green purchasing and the SCOR model are used to construct a structural equation model (SEM). An SEM analysis is conducted to establish the relationship between the PDSA of green purchasing, the sourcing process, and its performance on the SCOR model. The results of this study provide some suggestions for companies conducting green purchasing. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",10.1080/14783363.2010.529361,Total Quality Management and Business Excellence,Green purchasing | PDSA cycle | Structural equation model (SEM) | Supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model,78650298980,A study on the relationship between the PDSA cycle of green purchasing and the performance of the SCOR model,2010.0
873,"In a global economic environment, many enterprises expend their overseas markets and implement outsourcing of logistics activities to external carriers. Many enterprises pay close attention to successful delivery of their freight. Hence, how to determine the optimal carrier selection is a very critical issue for global enterprises. Generally, there are several carriers to serve on each route connecting two cities (or transfer stations) in the logistics network. Each carrier owns multiple available capacities with a probability distribution because the carrier's capacity may be partially reserved for other orders. A carrier selection means selecting exact one carrier on each route, and the logistics network according to the carrier selection is thus a stochastic logistic network. The network reliability is a performance index of freight delivery for supply chain management and is defined as the probability that d units of commodity are successfully transmitted from a supplier to a customer. This study focuses on the optimal carrier selection problem based on network reliability criterion. A GA-based algorithm that combines the minimal paths and the recursive sum of disjoint products is developed to determine the optimal carrier selection with the maximal network reliability. A practical logistics example of the LCD monitors delivery from Asia to Europe is presented to illustrate the solution procedure. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

874,"Recent supply chain accidents due to epidemics, terrorist attacks and severe earthquake in Haiti killing thousands of people as well as typhoon over Manila causing flood to wash out millions worth of property, indicate that firms are vulnerable in today's highly integrated supply chains. Global financial crisis started in the mid 2007 has also brought further implications on supply chain problems. As economic recession reached the bottom line, supply chain managers experience a different kind of risks as the source of vulnerability. The effectiveness of supply chain mitigation strategy which provide a greater ability to respond volatile circumstances is immediate important. This study explores the perspectives of managers in the manufacturing firms on supply chain vulnerability and mitigation strategy within Indonesian environment.

This research examines the carbon footprint across supply chains and thus contributes to the knowledge and practice of green supply chain management. The analytical model uses the long-range Lagrangian and the Eulerian transport methods. Analytical and finite difference methods are used to approximate the three-dimensional infinite footprint model. A simplified numerical example validates and illustrates the proposed approach. The results show that carbon emissions across stages in a supply chain can constitute a significant threat that warrants careful attention in the design phase of supply chains. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.,10.1016/j.ijpe.2010.01.018,International Journal of Production Economics,Carbon footprint | Eulerian box model | Green supply chain management | Heat link | Lagrangian box model,77957822063,Modeling carbon footprints across the supply chain,2010.0

877,"The development of renewable energy sources has clearly emerged as a promising policy towards enhancing the fragile global energy system with its limited fossil fuel resources, as well as for reducing the related environmental problems. In this context, waste biomass utilization has emerged as a viable alternative for energy production, encompassing a wide range of potential thermochemical, physicochemical and bio-chemical processes. Two significant bottlenecks that hinder the increased biomass utilization for energy production are the cost and complexity of its logistics operations. In this manuscript, we present a critical synthesis of the relative state-of-the-art literature as this applies to all stakeholders involved in the design and management of waste biomass supply chains (WBSCs). We begin by presenting the generic system components and then the unique characteristics of WBSCs that differentiate them from traditional supply chains. We proceed by discussing state-of-the-art energy conversion technologies along with the resulting classification of all relevant literature. We then recognize the natural hierarchy of the decision-making process for the design and planning of WBSCs and provide a taxonomy of all research efforts as these are mapped on the relevant strategic, tactical and operational levels of the hierarchy. Our critical synthesis demonstrates that biomass-to-energy production is a rapidly evolving research field focusing mainly on biomass-to-energy production technologies. However, very few studies address the critical supply chain management issues, and the ones that do that, focus mainly on (i) the assessment of the potential biomass and (ii) the allocation of biomass collection sites and energy production facilities. Our analysis further allows for the identification of gaps and overlaps in the existing literature, as well as of critical future research areas. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.wasman.2010.02.030,Waste Management,,77956262709,Waste biomass-to-energy supply chain management: A critical synthesis,2010.0
878,"In recent years, with the raising of awareness in environmental protection and sustainable development in enterprises, the green issue has become more and more critical in supply chain management. This study intends to develop a green supplier selection model which integrates artificial neural network (ANN) and two multi-attribute decision analysis (MADA) methods: data envelopment analysis (DEA) and analytic network process (ANP). It is called ANN-MADA hybrid method. ANN-MADA hybrid method considers both practicality in traditional supplier selection criteria and environmental regulations. It also overcomes traditional DEA drawbacks, limitations of data accuracy and decision-making units (DMUs) amounts constraint. The model evaluation results of an international well-known camera manufacturer indicate that the ANN-MADA hybrid method outperforms two other hybrid methods, ANN-DEA and ANP-DEA. It was also discovered that ANN-MADA has better power of discrimination and noise-insensitivity in evaluating green suppliers' performances. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

879,"As low cost manufacturing locations have emerged, and economic pressures have made manufacturing in Western countries less viable, more and more companies have turned to outsourcing and brand development as strategies for survival and growth. However, with strict delivery dates, high production volumes and low margins, this ""new business model"" has set a number of challenges. For manufacturers, strict delivery dates, high production volumes and low margins make effective resource utilisation critical. Brand owners who outsource production are dependent upon their suppliers to deliver the right product, at the right time and to the right quality standards. Retailers-who tend to hold the bargaining power-are developing their own private brands and moving back up the supply chain. As they do so, they are finding that the complexity they have to manage is increasing. Furthermore, in Western economies, most textile and apparel markets are fairly saturated, so it is a challenge for retailers and brand owners to grow their market share. In many Asian countries, by contrast, consumer markets are continuing to grow, and in many cases they are growing rapidly. Textile and apparel companies can adopt a number of different business models to grow their businesses and differentiate their products in the market place. Key elements to consider when building a new business model or evolving an existing one include: outsourcing production; sourcing strategically or opportunistically; increasing the number of collections in a year and having shorter product life cycles; extending the brand; expanding into retail; multichannel selling; offering fast fashion; vertical integration; increasing control of the supply chain and agility in reacting to changes; multi-sourcing; and building customer intimacy. Innovative business models can offer textile and apparel companies a competitive advantage for at least a period of time. Often a textile and apparel company's business model has core competencies embedded within it which are hard to copy. It is recommended, therefore, that all apparel and textile companies should regularly review their business models, seek and develop business models which differentiate their offering, and evaluate their use of technology and information systems. © Textiles Intelligence Limited 2010.",,Textile Outlook International,,79952971265,Evolving business models in the textile and apparel industry,2010.0
880,"Lately, the use of solar energy has seen considerable development. Transformation in electric energy is one of its applications which attracts considerable interest, owing to the fact that it makes it possible to solve a major problem in isolated cities that lack electrical supply networks. For solar energy use, the current drawback remains its high cost. This problem can be resolved through different improvements in terms of power production. For that, different axis of research can be explored [1-3]. Over the past few years, solar cells arrays (SCA) have been connected to various loads in a direct coupled method. A PV module can produce the power at a point, called an operating point, anywhere on the current- voltage (I-V) curve. The coordinates of the Operating point are the operating voltage and current. There is a unique point near the knee of the I-V curve, called a maximum power point (MPP), at which the module operates with the maximum efficiency and produces the maximum output power. The point of maximum power is the desired operating point for a PV array to obtain maximum efficiency. A PV array is usually oversized to compensate for a low power yield during winter months. This mismatching between a PV module and a load requires further over-sizing of the PV array and thus increases the overall system cost [3-5]. To mitigate this problem, different methods have been developed [6-12]. A maximum power point tracker (MPPT) can be used to maintain the PV module's operating point at the MPP. The system in a direct coupled method cannot always operate at maximum power point (MPP) of the solar array when the load, irradiance or temperature changes. A PV-load coupling system should be able to maximize the energy output of the PV generator, which should operate always at its maximum power point (MPP) in order to achieve maximum global efficiency. Some authors have supported the direct coupling between the PV generator and the load [2-3]. Several methods and algorithms to track the maximum power point have been developed [2-12]. We focused our effort on improving the matching between PV sources and loads through the development of new performing methods. In this paper, a rapid approach for peak power tracking is proposed. The system PV generator - load is optimized, when the working point in direct coupling is quite near the MPP of the PV generator, so that the global efficiency of the system is acceptable. Another method is proposed. It is based on reconfiguring on-line the SCA by changing the connections between different modules in order to minimize the losses due to load and operation conditions. Two strategies for improvements are chosen for testing in this study, whatever the loads and operating conditions. he experimental system used a microcontroller. It is robust when undergoing environment changes and load variations. The performance of the methods is verified through simulations and experiments.",,Acta Polytechnica Hungarica,Configuration | MPPT | Optimum power | Photovoltaic | Switching,77954654266,Proposed methods to increase the output efficiency of a photovoltaic (PV) system,2010.0
881,"This paper discusses Supply Chain Network (SCN) design problem under uncertainty, and presents a critical review of the optimization models proposed in the literature. Some drawbacks and missing aspects in the literature are pointed out, thus motivating the development of a comprehensive SCN design methodology. Through an analysis of supply chains uncertainty sources and risk exposures, the paper reviews key random environmental factors and discusses the nature of major disruptive events threatening SCN. It also discusses relevant strategic SCN design evaluation criteria, and it reviews their use in existing models. We argue for the assessment of SCN robustness as a necessary condition to ensure sustainable value creation. Several definitions of robustness, responsiveness and resilience are reviewed, and the importance of these concepts for SCN design is discussed.

882,"An efficient integration of production and distribution plans into a unified framework is critical to achieving competitive advantage. This paper addresses the production and distribution planning problem in a supply chain system that involves the allocation of production volumes among the different production lines in the manufacturing plants, and the delivery of the products to the distribution centers. An integrated optimization model for production and distribution planning is proposed, with the aimed of optimally coordinating important and interrelated logistics decisions. However, a real supply chain operates in a highly dynamic and uncertain environment. Therefore, this model is transformed into fuzzy models taking into account the fuzziness in the capacity constraints, and the aspiration level of costs using different aggregation operators.

883,"Geographical indications (GIs) are place-based names that conveythe geographical origin, as well as the cultural and historical identity, of agricultural products. GIs are unique, in that they provide ameans of ensuring that control over production and sales of a product stays within a local area, but at the same time they make use of extralocal markets. Although control over GIs largely rests with local actors, GIs are nested in wider regional, national, and international networks; and the passage from local to extralocal markets introduces new costs and benefits and new relations of power into the supply chain. The degree to which GI protection spurs development and protects local environmental and cultural resources depends on the structure of the GI legislation and on the territorial context in which protection is embedded. Using a commodity-chains approach, I compare two GI production systems, tequila in Mexico and Comté cheese in France, in order to develop a theory of the factors that contribute to more sustainable, equitable GI production systems. I argue that three key differences in the design of the GI schemes help to explain the varying effects of the two cases: (1) the manner in which supply-chain actors define quality, (2) the way that the GI valorizes the terroir of the region, and (3) the strength and cohesion that the collective organizing body exhibits. Moreover, the institutional and political context in which GI supply chains ""touch down"" plays a critical role. Contrary to a conceptualization of GIs as compatible with a purely market-oriented model, my comparison of these two cases indicates that some level of state involvement, in order to level the playing field and empower small farmers, is a necessary, although not sufficient, precondition for successful and sustainable GIs. © 2010, by the Rural Sociological Society.",10.1111/j.1549-0831.2009.00007.x,Rural Sociology,,77954771241,Embedding local places in global spaces: Geographical indications as a territorial development strategy,2010.0
884,"Introduction: The biannual Life Cycle Management conference series aims to create a platform for users and developers of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and related tools to share their experiences. A key concern of the LCM community has been to move beyond the production of LCA reports toward using the developed knowledge. This paper reports and evaluates some of the main outcomes of the 4th International Life Cycle Management Conference (LCM 2009). Results: Conference focus: While the focus of the conference was LCM, LCA remains a main analytical tool for supporting LCM. This is clearly shown by the overall program in which roughly half of the contributions focused on or used LCA. Some products and resources and environmental themes were markedly represented in the presentation subjects. Conference participation: The 180 delegates included 40 South Africans, 20 from other African countries, and 140 from as far afield as Brazil, Sweden, Japan, and Australia. The surveyable number of delegates and conference rooms, in combination with the well-balanced scientific and social program, facilitated optimal professional exchange and discussion. Conference structure: LCM 2009 featured some 140 contributions from 47 leading environmental practitioners, consultants, and academic researchers. The interactive conference format included three plenary sessions and training workshops. Conclusions: LCM 2009 successfully engaged with the critical questions of what it means to manage (not merely shift) the environmental and social impacts of global economic activity, what this entails for industry and public services in emerging economies, and how supply chains, networks, and partnerships can be stimulated and managed to deliver truly sustainable practice. © 2010 US Government.",10.1007/s11367-010-0167-4,International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,Conference | Life cycle assessment | Life cycle management | Social impacts | Sustainability,77953028933,From life cycle talking to taking action: The 4th International Conference on Life Cycle Management: The Global Challenge of Managing Life Cycles,2010.0
885,"The traditional definition of sustainability calls for policies and strategies that meet society's present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Through the 1970 National Environmental Policy Act, U.S. policy formally established the goal of creating and maintaining ""conditions under which [humans] and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans."" However, we have not yet succeeded in making sustainability operational. The long-standing and current debates on setting energy policy, regulating greenhouse gases, and promoting alternate fuels illustrate the complexity of making sustainability operational. Achieving operational sustainability requires three critical elements: advances in science and technology, application of effective government regulations and policies, and green business practices. Not only are these elements necessary, all three must work together across the economy. A key lesson drawn from the history of environmental regulation and especially in the climate debate is that sustainability cannot be advanced without a convergence of government and business interests even when the requisite technology is available. The biofuel system presents an immediate and tangible test case for the successful interaction of these three critical elements. The massive investments in science and technology by both government and industry to develop new feedstocks and conversion methods are showing promise. From a regulatory perspective, existing statutes and new mandates impact all parts of the biofuel supply chain-a complex system involving feedstocks, conversion technologies, transport, storage, handling, and end use. Forward-looking businesses in the biofuel sector are integrating sustainability objectives into their business strategies, such as designing feedstock conversion processes to generate biofuel coproducts that can add substantial revenue. The combination and coordination of such activities have the potential to achieve sustainable biofuel production and to demonstrate the kind of critical approaches that are essential to making sustainability operational in this and other energy sectors. © 2010 U.S. Government.",10.1063/1.3384210,Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy,,79952596063,Perspectives on achieving sustainable energy production and use,2010.0
886,"Capacity planning in the reverse channel of closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) involves complex issues due to the different lifecycles of product offerings in combination with the variability regarding product usage time, quality level of used products and return patterns. (Georgiadis, P., Vlachos, D., Tagaras, G., 2006. The impact of product lifecycle on capacity planning of closed-loop supply chains with remanufacturing. Production and Operations Management 15; 514-527) developed a system dynamics (SD) model to study a CLSC with remanufacturing for a single product which incorporates a dynamic capacity modeling approach. We extend this SD model for two sequential product-types under two alternative scenarios regarding the market preferences over the product-types; in the first scenario, the market is considered showing no preferences, while in the second scenario, the demand over a product-type can be satisfied only by providing units of the specific type. We study how the joint lifecycles of two product-types, entry time of the second product-type to the market and used product return patterns affect the optimal policies regarding expansion and contraction of collection and remanufacturing capacities. The results of extensive numerical investigation are tested for their statistical significance using analysis of variance (ANOVA). In the first scenario, the results show that the system performs best when the two lifecycles form a trapezoid pattern for total demand while in the second scenario, when the two lifecycles form a triangular pattern. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We then integrate the risk management procedures into design, planning, and performance evaluation process of supply chain networks through Petri net (PN) based simulation. The developed PN model provides an efficient environment for defining uncertainties in the system and evaluating the added value of the risk mitigation actions.

888,"Purpose: Within the context of a sustainable supply chain, the purpose of this paper is to report on empirical longitudinal research on supply chain network evolution and dynamics of governance in a multi-stakeholder supply chain sustainability initiative led by Nespresso, the speciality coffee division of Nestlé. Design/methodology/approach: The paper proposes a framework to study the creation and evolution of governance mechanisms over a five-year period. Data from 48 semi-structured interviews and 15 recent and historic documents were also analysed. The interviews were conducted among current and past representatives of all the organisations concerned including coffee traders, NGOs and farmers. Findings: In contrast with literature on the subject, governance mechanisms initially relied mostly on informal mechanisms. Formal governance mechanisms were incorporated into the relationships to enable the supply chain network to grow and to provide clarity to all actors. Relational quality processes that increased trust were critical elements in the early phase, and were explicitly built into a second phase of development. Research limitations/implications: Being a single case study, some caution needs to be applied to generalise findings beyond the specific context studied. An additional methodological limitation is the limited number of actors involved in the overall supply chain network. Practical implications: The paper shows the importance of treating governance mechanisms within the supply chain not as a fixed variable to be determined once and for all in the beginning of a relationship, but rather to adapt the coordination mechanisms of the relationships. Originality/value: The evolution of relationships over time has been ""often called for but rarely chosen"".

The explosion in long-distance sourcing is exposing supply chains and shareholder value at ever increasing operational and disruption risks. It is well established, both in academia and in real-world business environments, that resource flexibility is an effective method for hedging against supply chain disruption risks. In this contextual framework, we propose a single period stochastic inventory decision-making model that could be employed for capturing the trade-off between inventory policies and disruption risks for an unreliable dual sourcing supply network for both the capacitated and uncapacitated cases.

890,"Agri-food enterprises operate in a complex and dynamic environment. To meet increasing demands of consumers, government and business partners, enterprises continuously have to work on innovations of products, processes and ways of cooperation in agri-food supply chain networks (AFSCN). Hence, a development towards a more knowledge-based economy is needed. The Lisbon strategy, launched by the European Union, to attain this knowledge-based economy, has failed so far. This paper argues that information sharing and organizing ICT are main critical areas to overcome this deadlock. However, ICT development in AFSCN involves an information integration task that has to deal with technical and organizational requirements and starts with an existing installed base. Traditional software engineering approaches are inadequate to address these issues. This paper provides an overall method for analysis, design and implementation of information integration, taking technical as well as organizational development into account. The method was derived from experiences in a research and development program in the Dutch arable farming sector. A generic integration framework forms the backbone of the method to ensure systematic and sustainable ICT development. Business process management (BPM), in combination with reference information models, plays an important role. The technical architecture and infrastructure are based on a service-oriented architecture (SOA). Attention is paid to the organizational infrastructure that is needed to embed the results in the right context, so that they will be broadly supported and used. The method is divided into three phases: analysis, basic design and iterative implementation. Analysis of the current situation in AFSCN is supported by an information integration framework. The basic design is a first version of the generic integration framework. In the iterative implementation phase, pilot projects are guided by this basic design, which results in incremental growth of the framework. The pilot projects follow a Living Lab (LL) approach. LLs represent a user-centric, open innovation approach for sensing, prototyping, validating and refining complex solutions in multiple and evolving real life contexts. The method is illustrated by an application to the Dutch arable farming sector. It can be concluded that the contribution of the presented method lies in combining different methodologies into a design approach for information integration, based on a sound architecture. The presented method leads to ICT that follows the business processes in real life and thus enhances appropriate information sharing to support a knowledge-based economy. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Indeed, we can view any current structure and organization that characterize a system as being forged out of the past events and crises that led to change and innovation. Each individual, group, firm, corporation, shareholder and observer experience path-dependent learning, whereby current learning is conditional by the events and decisions taken in the past. In reality, the new system or structure that comes into being at a given time, although initially seen as a successful response to some past problem, will move into an unknowable future that will necessarily end in some new crisis, the emergence of some unexpected new factors, effects or implications that will have to be dealt with. A simple probabilistic model of event dynamics is presented showing that the discussions of power laws and self-organized criticality assume a stationary situation and the probability of given events. We contrast this with examples from human systems that are about qualitative, structural change and path-dependent learning. The first example involves the handling of severe motorway traffic accidents and the second describes the evolution of supply chains by trial and error, as new practices are adopted or rejected in a changing competitive economic environment. Social and economic systems must evolve, and will do so through the occurrence of seemingly extreme events, requiring adaptation and change. The important lesson therefore is to accept that there will be always a potential for unexpected and surprising events and that we need to build systems that are robust and resilient to their occurrence. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.",10.1057/rm.2009.15,Risk Management,Complexity | Evolution | Instability | Power laws,76249098656,The evolutionary complexity of social and economic systems: The inevitability of uncertainty and surprise,2010.0

893,"Colleges and universities are moving away from the traditional focus on single exchange transactions and towards an emphasis on creating and maintaining longer-term buyer-supplier relationships. These strategic relationships generate managed supply chain relationships that encompass activities associated with the flow of goods and services, as well as the flow of information. The need to understand the complexities of the relationships in the supply chain and how these relationships are viewed by both buyers and suppliers is critical.

894,"Operations research (OR) methodologies in optimization have been extensively applied to problems in different agricultural value chains in recent years. We take a critical stock take of such applications to date, and reflect on their contribution to value chain sustainability and resilience. The stock take shows that the rate of industry or policy adoption has been limited, partly due to the complex interactions across the segments of agricultural value chains, and the mathematical representation being different to the way the decision maker understands the problem. OR practice in agriculture is also being asked to cover greater spatial scales and engage more stakeholders, and is required to embrace resilience and sustainability objectives. A single-minded focus on optimizing parts of these complex systems without considering the whole system is no longer adequate, and new methods and approaches are required. Complex systems science methods are being applied to analyse the dynamics of complex social-ecological systems, and are starting to find a home in industrial supply chain analysis. We demonstrate how three complex system methods, agent-based modelling, dynamical systems modelling and network analysis, can be applied to agricultural value chains as a means of gaining insights into system dynamics under different and dynamic conditions. The relevance and utility of OR in ensuring the success of agricultural value chains into the future will require practitioners to understand and model value chains as complex adaptive systems. © 2010 Operational Research Society Ltd.

895,"This paper examines a number of electronic data interchange (EDI) usage and implementation factors and their role in improving a firm's efficiency, productivity and competitiveness. Unlike other studies in the literature that use exclusively linear models, we apply nonlinear neural networks to model the relationship between performance improvement and a set of predictor variables of EDI usage and supply chain coordination activities. A variable selection method is employed to identify key factors to predict a firm's operational excellence due to EDI implementation. In addition, a bootstrap resampling scheme is used to evaluate the robustness of the results. Note to Practitioners-Competing successfully in a highly competitive environment requires firms to coordinate well with their suppliers and customers. In this paper, we study the issue of how EDI implementation activities and usage affect a firm's performance. Our research has several important implications to practitioners. First, although a firm's performance improvement in several key areas may be attributed to many different aspects of EDI use and coordination activities, only a few key variables are critical. By focusing on a few key coordination activities and EDI implementation issues, managers are able to achieve significant performance improvement in efficiency, productivity, and competitiveness. Second, we find that coordination activities through the implementation of EDI can clearly improve many facets of a firm's performance, developing strategic alliances with supply chain partners is essential in enhancing both a firm's and its supply chain's competitiveness. Third, while using the basic routine EDI can improve efficiency, it is the enhanced use of the EDI system that contributes more to the productivity improvement and firm competitiveness. © 2009 IEEE.",10.1109/TASE.2009.2016351,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,Electronic data interchange | Neural networks | Nonlinear modeling | Resampling | Supply chain management | Variable selection,73849108598,Modeling the relationship between EDI implementation and firm performance improvement with neural networks,2010.0
896,"The notion of social capital or embeddedness has received increased attention in the field of supply chain management. However, although embeddedness has both a structural and a relational aspect, the structural has received more focus. In addition, circumstances that may affect the development of social capital, and the role and import of a focal firm's supply management function on aspects of social capital, remain unclear. This study draws on the social network perspective to explore factors associated with the relational embeddedness of social capital, and investigate the role of supply management on the process. Using empirical data collected from 204 U.S. manufacturing firms, an empirical framework is proposed and tested using structural equation modeling. The results of this study suggest a mechanism through which social capital affects firm performance, and indicate that the supply management function may contribute to sustainable competitive advantage. The study confirms that the relational embeddedness aspect of social capital should be treated as a critical antecedent to performance. It also highlights the potential role of the supply management function in developing social capital in dyadic network interactions. © 2009 Institute for Supply Management, Inc.™.",10.1111/j.1745-493X.2009.03185.x,Journal of Supply Chain Management,Relational embeddedness | Social capital | Social network analysis | Strategic purchasing | Supply interactions | Supply management | Survey methods,72449164889,The effect of supply management on aspects of social capital and the impact on performance: A social network perspective,2010.0

898,"Many firms implemented various initiatives such as outsourced manufacturing which could make a supply chain (SC) more vulnerable to various types of disruptions. So managing risk has become a critical component of SC management. Different types of SC vulnerability management methodologies have been proposed for managing SC risk, most offer only point-based solutions that deal with a limited set of risks. This research aims to reinforce SC risk management by proposing an integrated approach. SC risks are identified and a risk index classification structure is created. Then we develop a SC risk assessment approach based on the analytic network process (ANP) and the VIKOR methods under the fuzzy environment where the vagueness and subjectivity are handled with linguistic terms parameterized by triangular fuzzy numbers. By using FANP, risks weights are calculated and then inserted to the FVIKOR to rank the SC members and find the most risky partner.",,"World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology",Analytic network process (ANP) | Fuzzy sets | Supply chain risk management (SCRM) | VIšekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR),78651535031,A combined fuzzy decision making approach to supply chain risk assessment,2009.0
899,"A preliminary study in comparative ecological network analysis was conducted to identify key assumptions and methodological challenges, test initial hypotheses and explore systemic and network structural characteristics for environmentally sustainable ecosystems. A nitrogen network for the U.S. beef supply chain - a small sub-network of the industrial food system analyzed as a pilot study - was constructed and compared to four non-human carbon and nitrogen trophic networks for the Chesapeake Bay and the Florida Everglades. These non-human food webs served as sustainable reference systems. Contrary to the main original hypothesis, the ""window of vitality"" and the number of network roles did not clearly differentiate between a human sub-network and the more complete non-human networks. The effective trophic level of humans (a partial estimate of trophic level based on the single food source of beef) was much higher (8.1) than any non-human species (maximum of 4.88). Network connectance, entropy, total dependency coefficients, trophic efficiencies and the ascendency to capacity ratio also indicated differences that serve as hypotheses for future tests on more comprehensive human food webs. The study elucidated important issues related to (1) the steady state assumption, which is more problematic for industrial human systems, (2) the absence or dearth of data on contributions of dead humans and human wastes to feed other species in an integrated food web, (3) the ambiguity of defining some industrial compartments as living versus non-living, and (4) challenges with constructing compartments and trophic transfers in industrial versus non-human food webs. The two main novel results are (1) the progress made toward adapting ecological network analysis (ENA) methodology for analysis of human food networks in industrial cultures and (2) characterizing the critical aspects of comparative ENA for understanding potential causes of the problems, and providing avenues for solutions, for environmental sustainability. Based on this work, construction and comparative network analysis of a more comprehensive industrial human food network seems warranted and likely to provide valuable insights for modifying structures of industrial food networks to be more like natural networks and more sustainable. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

900,"The design and management of a multi-stage production-distribution system is one of the most critical problems in logistics and in facility management. Companies need to be able to evaluate and design different configurations for their logistic networks as quickly as possible. This means coordinating the entire supply chain effectively in order to minimize costs and simultaneously optimize facilities location, the allocation of customer demand to production/distribution centers, the inbound and outbound transportation activities, the product flows between production and/or warehousing facilities, the reverse logistics activities, etc. Full optimization of supply chain is achieved by integrating strategic, tactical, and operational decision-making in terms of the design, management, and control of activities. The cost-based and mixed-integer programming model presented in this study has been developed to support management in making the following decisions: the number of facilities (e.g. warehousing systems, distribution centers), the choice of their locations and the assignment of customer demand to them, and also incorporate tactical decisions regarding inventory control, production rates, and service-level determination in a stochastic environment. This paper presents an original model for the dynamic location-allocation problem with control of customer service level and safety stock optimization. An experimental analysis identifies the most critical factors affecting the logistics cost, and to finish, an industrial application is illustrated demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed optimization approach. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

902,"Purpose: This paper aims to systematically document drivers of change and the implications they will have on international supply chain management in the coming two decades. Design/methodology/approach: This study was commissioned by the World Customs Organization (WCO) at the end of June 2006. Because of increased trade volumes, emerging complex supply networks and heightened security concerns, the WCO saw the need to assess future trends and drivers in supply chain management. The Delphi method was applied to identify a set of foreseeable drivers of change and to assess their predicted impact on global supply chain management in the coming ten to 20 years. Based on a literature review of 150 recent publications and interviews among 33 industry, academic and customs experts, a survey was designed and conducted to collect current and potential change drivers in global supply chains. These drivers were compiled and prioritized by an eclectic team of 12 specialists. Findings: The main results of the study are strongly connected to strategic and operational supply chain planning for the next ten to 20 years. They are related to increased off-shoring of operations through truly global manufacturing, characterized by its intercontinental supply of materials; increased product complexity with shorter product life cycles; increased importance of business-to-government networking for operational and security efficiency; introduction of new supply chain services integrating financial, physical and information flows leading to further consolidation in the logistics markets; and the overall increase in risks and vulnerabilities in international supply chains.

903,"The construction industry has incurred a considerable amount of waste as a result of poor logistics supply chain network management. Therefore, managing logistics in the construction industry is critical. An effective logistic system ensures delivery of the right products and services to the right players at the right time while minimising costs and rewarding all sectors based on value added to the supply chain. This paper reports on an on-going research study on the concept of context-aware services delivery in the construction project supply chain logistics. As part of the emerging wireless technologies, an Intelligent Wireless Web (IWW) using context-aware computing capability represents the next generation ICT application to construction-logistics management. This intelligent system has the potential of serving and improving the construction logistics through access to context-specific data, information and services. Existing mobile communication deployments in the construction industry rely on static modes of information delivery and do not take into account the worker's changing context and dynamic project conditions. The major problems in these applications are lack of context-specificity in the distribution of information, services and other project resources, and lack of cohesion with the existing desktop based ICT infrastructure. The research works focus on identifying the context dimension such as user context, environmental context and project context, selection of technologies to capture context-parameters such wireless sensors and RFID, selection of supporting technologies such as wireless communication, Semantic Web, Web Services, agents, etc. The process of integration of Context-Aware Computing and Web-Services to facilitate the creation of intelligent collaboration environment for managing construction logistics will take into account all the necessary critical parameters such as storage, transportation, distribution, assembly, etc. within off and on-site project. © 2009 The authors.",,Electronic Journal of Information Technology in Construction,Construction-logistics | Context-aware | Intelligent wireless web | Wireless networking,70350168448,Intelligent wireless web services: Context-aware computing in construction-logistics supply chain,2009.0
904,"Competitive pressures are forcing companies to adopt practices and supply chain structures that will produce high quality, reliable, reasonably priced products with continuously shorter lead times. In order to meet these goals, companies are utilizing flatter organizational structures and narrower supply chains. Flatter structures and narrower supply chains typically reap the benefits of reduced coordination costs and improved organizational efficiencies. However, there exists an associated burden of an increased risk of a single point of failure that could leave the supply chain unable to deliver products to the market in a timely manner. This research study develops a model of risk, called the risk assessment index, to assess the vulnerability of different supply chain structures. It is determined that there exists significant trade-offs between the number of suppliers in the supplier base, product diversification, supply chain coordination, and supply chain efficiency that must be examined for a supply chain to remain competitive in a highly risky, vulnerable environment.",10.1080/10466690902934532,Journal of Marketing Channels,Marketing channels | Network design | Risk | Supply chain,71049154098,Mitigating supply chain vulnerability,2009.0
905,"The production costs reduction in a highly competitive environment is a critical success factor. In particular, in fields where outsourcing is used frequently and the impact of the material costs is high, a significant cost reduction can be achieved making more efficient value chain. Moreover, the use of outsourcing is a way to adjust production capacity depending on demand. Therefore the coordination and planning of the various rings of the chain and the estimate of the productive capability of the various production units become fundamental for a coherent evaluation of promised delivery times. More and more frequently and in greater detail the Companies at the ""end of the network"" require, through capacity assessment a verification of the available productive capacity of the manufacturing units, both from a quality and quantity point of view, that each single firm can dedicate to a certain type of production. In this paper it is presented a simulation model that allows the elaboration of an operative plan of production through the verification of finite capacity scheduling of resources. The model tends to minimize costs of stocking and set-up, considering other production costs as constant. The simulation is a technique that allows the checking with better precision of the use of the resources with variation of the ties. This approach lead to a high performing instrument in the field of the advanced planning and scheduling through analysis of the various possible views. The auxiliary use of the optimizing tool available in the ARENA software allows an optimal solution, confirming the validity of the study of new applications of the simulative instrument for the verification of productive capacity in the short term.",,WSEAS Transactions on Information Science and Applications,Advanced planning and scheduling | Capacity management | Finite capacity scheduling | Simulation | Supply chain management,66349127117,Optimization of production plan through simulation techniques,2009.0
906,"Supply risk or the likelihood of supply disruptions is emerging as a key challenge to supply chain management. The ability to identify which supplier has greater potential of a disruption is a critical first step in managing the frequency and impact of these disruptions that often significantly impact on the supply chain. This paper presents preliminary research concepts regarding a new approach to the identification and prediction of supply risk. This approach to the assessment and classification of suppliers is based on supplier's attributes, performances and supply chain characteristics, while it is also modified by factors in the supplier's specific environment. The challenges posed to supply chains due to a turbulent environment (both from within the industry and external influences) are examined. A new method for the assessment and classification of suppliers based on their characteristics, performances and the environment of the industry in which they operate is presented.

907,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to empirically assess the importance of knowledge management (KM) for sustainable development. Two main hypotheses about the critical success factors of knowledge and technology contribution to sustainable development are tested. Design/methodology/approach - The research is carried out using surveys and interviews among a KM/integrated information and communication technologies (IICTs) sustainable development community. Findings - Results show that KM is critical for innovation, prioritization and efficient use of resources. A significant linear association between IICTs and KM across time and geography is detected. IICTs improve the quality of shared decision making in inter- and intra-organizational settings. Paradoxically, IICTs lead to information overload, and digitization leads to knowledge dilution 'de-contextualization'. Nevertheless, these drawbacks are outweighed by the multitude of the converged technologies benefits. Research limitations/implications - There is a limited amount of data subjected to the statistical analysis. This may skew some of the results, and inflate the experimental error. However, the limited data are due to the restricted targeted population itself. Originality/value - The results in this paper led to the proposal of the knowledge iterative supply network (KISN) framework, which describes knowledge lifecycle that lessens technology negative impacts.

In today's competitive and dynamic environment, application of the resource sharing approach has become the focal point of attention for business managers. By resource sharing and through common platform guidelines, the possibility of producing an extended variety of products using the least variable production elements is provided.

909,"Purpose – There is significant anecdotal evidence of increasing global supply chain fragility; and, for this reason, robustness and operational sustainability are of notable concern to senior executives. Though the issues are myriad, four factors dominate these concerns: increasing complexity of products, processes, and technologies, increasing structural complexity of supply chains, increasing diversity and global nature of business systems, and the environmental costs and impacts of extended supply chains. This paper aims to focus on these factors. Design/methodology/approach – This conceptual, theoretical paper differentiates corporate sustainability and operational robustness in terms of profitability and costs, then defines and develops internal, external, and uncontrollable fragility factors. A process that measures and integrates these factors is proposed for brainstorming and decision making. Additionally, methods to represent and compare alternatives, progress against internal or external targets, and industry goals or known competitor values are offered. Findings – This study describes and demonstrates an easy/to/implement process to address the potentially disastrous consequences of supply chain fragility. Practical implications – This study offers both academicians and practitioners a model to research, assess, and identify the risks and costs of current levels of supply chain fragility and to weigh various solutions. Originality/value – Unfortunately, few research efforts define these issues or identify the associated risks. Further, little has been put forward to posit, model, and facilitate the practical decision process to address these factor relationships. To these ends, the paper proposes a “fragility index” to help supply chain managers assess sources and potential costs of fragility, sustainability, and the associated environmental stress in their supply chains. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",10.1108/17410380910929600,Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management,Risk management | Supply chain management,84993099357,Weak links in the supply chain: Measuring fragility and sustainability,2009.0
910,"The emerging paradigm of network competition is increasingly in evidence across many industrial sectors and provides further support for the idea that 'supply chains compete, not companies'. It can be argued that network competition requires a much greater focus on managing the interfaces that connect the individual players in that network and exchanging and leveraging knowledge across the network. This paper sets out to establish a framework whereby the critical interfaces and the knowledge sharing benefits can be identified and how the strength of the relationships at those interfaces can become the basis for building organisational reputation and create an environment more conducive to co-operation and knowledge sharing. Finally, the paper analyses the potential impact of reputational risks in influencing the perception of stakeholders about the organisation. Whilst the idea of value-adding networks based on closely connected providers of capabilities and resources is appealing, it should be recognised that, if not properly managed, the actions of the stakeholders in those networks can impact the risk profile of the business significantly-particularly reputational risk. The more that organisations become part of complex global networks, the more dependent they become upon the other network members for knowledge and other resources. Because of this dependency there is always the danger that the reputation of the focal firm can be damaged by the actions of other network members, hence reducing the likelihood of future collaborative working and knowledge exploitation. Using examples drawn from a variety of industries, the paper highlights the potential for reputational risk if the critical network interfaces are not closely managed. It will be argued that by actively managing relationships with stakeholders in the network the risk to the organisation's reputation can be mitigated and the sharing of knowledge simultaneously enhanced. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Robust Bayesian belief networks with interval probabilities are used to estimate imprecise posterior probabilities in probabilistic inference.

The existing conventional water treatment plants were not designed for these unidentified contaminants. The endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) comprise pharmaceuticals, personal care products, surfactants, various industrial additives and numerous chemicals purported to be endocrine disrupter. These have become a threat to our water supply network. The current wastewater treatment system is not effective in elimination of these different classes of emerging contaminants as these have not been monitored due to the absence of stringent regulation specific to these contaminants.

The times when the scope of optimization just included the flow of materials is over. By now indirect processes and global value streams are implied, too. Lean supply chains do request an optimization of networks and not only the notion of a supplier-plant-relation. Together with suppliers and service providers the supply chains have to be optimized on the base of partnership. Another leverage of lean management is the possibility to shift the problem identification and solution to the early periods of the innovation and development process (frontloading). The sequential product and process planning has to be removed. One of the crucial principles in the planning period is clearness. © Carl Hanser Verlag.",10.3139/104.110033,ZWF Zeitschrift fuer Wirtschaftlichen Fabrikbetrieb,,65749111919,The second lean wave The Seven Theses,2009.0
916,"Reproducibility is a pillar of the scientific endeavour. We view computer simulations as laboratories for electronic experimentation and therefore as tools for science. Recent studies have addressed model reproduction and found it to be surprisingly difficult to replicate published findings. There have been enough failed simulation replications to raise the question, “can computer models be fully replicated?” This paper answers in the affirmative by reporting on a successful reproduction study using Mathematica, Repast and Swarm for the Beer Game supply chain model. The reproduction process was valuable because it demonstrated the original result’s robustness across modelling methodologies and implementation environments. © 2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",10.1504/IJSPM.2009.031099,International Journal of Simulation and Process Modelling,agent-based modelling | replication | reproduction | systems dynamics | verification,79951643734,Agent-based modelling and systems dynamics model reproduction,2009.0
917,"This paper presents a new mathematical model for designing distribution networks in a supply chain system considering service level constraint optimizing strategic decisions (location), tactical decisions (inventory), and assigning decisions. In real-world cases, demand, traveling time or any parameters in classical models may change over the period of time. So, considering uncertainty yields more flexibility for the results and the proposed model. In our study, environmental uncertainty is described by discrete scenarios. In this model, we have service level constraint in order to prevent inventory lost in distribution centers (DCs). Also, we assume that customer's demand is stochastic with Poisson distribution function and DCs have coverage radius constraints thus any DC cannot service all the customers. In this model, location of DCs is selected and optimized and the best flow of products from supplier to DCs also from DCs to customers is determined. In this way, the customers' demand should be satisfied at least service level. To solve this nonlinear integer programming model we first present a new and robust solution based on a genetic search framework and then based on genetic algorithm results and some optimizer rules we propose a new heuristic method. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

918,"Decentralized resource management is a promising field as it has the ability to lessen impact on Earth's climate change, assist with renewable technology development, increase equity in the distribution and consumption of resources, decrease vulnerability and enable participation of local people and businesses in the supply of technologies. Alternative energy and water resources are widely researched to provide self-sufficiency in scales of single houses to communities, but are still limited to demographical, technological, economical and social factors, which vary around the globe. Infra-Free (IF) is an academic research that seeks a synergy between relevant research fields to promote different decentralization scenarios for combined energy and water technologies with best-performance. The Infra-Free Motherboard (IF M ) is a proposal for a standardized platform, where installed technologies integrate within a household as robotic systems that evolve into a self-aware artificial platform to provide customized resource management. It addresses a multidirectional, real-time processing artificial resource management system that could develop its own skills by close interaction with the environment and the user. The system is enhanced with algorithms and dynamic systems to provide communication between different co-evolving systems that plug-in, adapt, evaluate and finally, customize themselves to dynamically changing environments due to resource availability, local needs, technology readiness and individual choices. The multidirectional real-time processing system further extends into a community application, where intelligent self-learning systems are aware of the amount and availability of resources in the whole network (community) and control the distribution between subsystems (houses) using best performance principles. Finally, this provides a dynamically transforming community that learns, adapts and redesigns itself. In this paper; at first, we introduce the standardized IF M and modular sub-system architecture. Next, we describe the hardware (platform) and software (self-learning process) architecture for the purpose to realize a customized real-time energy management system in a community of interconnected houses with a special focus on energy equation strategies. Next, we study a scenario to apply IF M in a small-scale community (100 people) in Masdar in 2012; integrated with a plug-in car concept, CO 2 recycle, evaporative cooling and Stirling engine system. Finally, we analyze the energy equalization potential of IF M in a computer simulation for a 6-household cluster (25 people).",10.3130/jaabe.8.407,Journal of Asian Architecture and Building Engineering,Decentralization | Infra-Free | Integrated source management | Intelligent design | Real-time energy equalization,72049127290,Application of infra-free motherboard (IF <sup>M</sup> ) in a decentralized community for a customized real-time processing multidirectional energy supply network,2009.0
919,"The pursuit of so-called ""green jobs"" - employment that contributes to protecting the environment and reducing humanity's carbon foot-print - will be a key economic driver of the 21st century. ""Climate-proofing"" the global economy will involve large-scale investments in new technologies, equipment, buildings, and infrastructure, which will provide a major stimulus for much-needed new employment and an opportunity for retaining and transforming existing jobs. The number of green jobs is on the rise. The renewable energy sector has seen rapid expansion in recent years, with current employment in renewables and supplier industries estimated at a conservative 2.3 million worldwide. The wind power industry employs some 300,000 people, the solar photovoltaics (PV) sector an estimated 170,000, and the solar thermal industry more than 600,000. More than I million jobs are found in the biofuels industry growing and processing a variety of feedstocks into ethanol and biodiesel. Construction jobs can be greened by ensuring that new buildings meet high performance standards. And retrofitting existing buildings to make them more energy-efficient has huge job potential for construction workers, architects, energy auditors, engineers, and others. The weatherization of some 200,000 apartments in Germany created 25,000 new jobs and helped retain 116,000 existing jobs in 2002-04. The transportation industry is a cornerstone of modern economics, but it also has the fastest-rising carbon emissions of any sector. Relatively green auto manufacturing jobs - those in manufacturing the most-efficient cars currently available - today number no more than about 250,000 out of roughly 8 million in the auto sector worldwide. Modern rail and urban transit systems offer a greener alternative, but they need fresh commitment and investments to reverse the job erosion of recent decades. In growing numbers of cities, good jobs are being generated by the emergence of bus rapid transit systems. There are also substantial green employment opportunities in retrofitting old diesel buses to reduce air pollutants and in replacing old equipment with cleaner compressed natural gas (CNG) or hybrid-electric buses. In New Delhi, the introduction of 6,100 CNG buses by 2009 is expected to create 18,000 new jobs. The steel, aluminum, cement, and paper industries are highly energy-intensive and polluting. But increasing scrap use, greater energy efficiency, and reliance on alternative energy sources may at least render them a pale shade of green. Worldwide, more than 40 percent of steel output and one-quarter of aluminum production is based on recycled scrap, possibly employing more than a quarter million people. Recycling and remanufacturing jobs worldwide number many millions, but incompatible definitions and a lack of data gathering make a global tally impossible. China alone is thought to have some 10 million jobs in this sector, and the United States has more than 1 million. In developing countries, recycling is often done by informal networks of scavengers. Brazil, which boasts a high rate of aluminum recycling, relies on some 500,000 scrap collectors. Cairo's 70,000 Zabaleen recycle as much as 85 percent of the materials they collect. Agriculture and forestry often still account for the bulk of employment and livelihoods in many developing countries. Small farms are more labor- and knowledge-intensive than agroindustrial farms are, and they use fewer energy and chemical inputs. But relatively sustainable forms of smallholder agriculture are being squeezed hard by energy- and pesticide-intensive farms and by global supply chains. Organic farming is still limited. But because it is more labor-intensive than industrialized agriculture, it can be a source of growing green employment. Afforestation and reforestation efforts, as well as better stewardship of critical ecosystems more generally, could support livelihoods among the more than 1 billion people who depend on forests, often through non-timber forest products. Planting trees creates large numbers of jobs, although these are often seasonal and low paid. Agroforestry, which combines tree planting with traditional farming, offers significant environmental benefits in degraded areas - including carbon sequestration. Some 1.2 billion people already depend on it to some extent. There is additional job potential in efforts to adapt to, and cope with, climate change. Building flood barriers, terracing land, and rehabilitating wetlands is labor-intensive work. Efforts to protect croplands from environmental degradation and to adapt farming to climate change by raising water efficiency, preventing erosion, planting trees, using conservation tillage, and rehabilitating degraded crop and pastureland can also support rural livelihoods. The potential for green jobs is immense. But much of it will not materialize without massive and sustained investments in the public and private sectors. Governments need to establish a firm framework for greening all aspects of the economy, with the help of targets and mandates, business incentives, and reformed tax and subsidy policies. It will also be critical to develop innovative forms of technology transfer to spread green methods around the world at the scale and speed required to avoid full-fledged climate change. Cooperative technology development and technology-sharing programs could help expedite the process of replicating best practices. To provide as many workers as possible with the qualifications they will increasingly need, an expansion of green education, training, and skill-building programs in a broad range of occupations is crucial. Resource extraction and energy-intensive industries are likely to feel the greatest impact in transitioning to a low-carbon future, and regions and communities highly dependent on them will need assistance in diversifying their economic base, creating alternative jobs and livelihoods, and acquiring new skills. This is known as a ""just transition."" Green jobs need to be decent jobs - offering good wages and income security, safe working conditions, dignity at work, and adequate workers' rights. Sadly, this is not always the case today. Recycling work is sometimes precarious, involving serious occupational health hazards and often generating less than living wages and incomes. Growing crops at biofuels plantations in countries like Brazil, Colombia, Malaysia, and Indonesia often involves excessive workloads, poor pay, exposure to pesticides, and oppression of workers. These cautionary aspects highlight the need for sustainable employment to be good not only for the environment but also for the people holding the jobs. Still, an economy that reconciles human aspirations with the planet's limits is eminently possible.",,Worldwatch Paper,,56449125974,Green jobs: Working for people and the environment,2008.0

921,"Recent economic and international threats to western industries have encouraged companies to increase their performance in all ways possible. Many look to deal quickly with disturbances, reduce inventory, and exchange information promptly throughout the supply chain. In other words they want to become more agile. To reach this objective it is critical for planning systems to present planning strategies adapted to the different contexts, to attain better performances. Due to consolidation, the development of integrated supply chains and the use of inter-organizational information systems have increased business interdependencies and in turn the need for increased collaboration to deal with disturbance in a synchronized way. Thus, agility and synchronization in supply chains are critical to maintain overall performance. In order to develop tools to increase the agility of the supply chain and to promote the collaborative management of such disturbances, agent-based technology takes advantage of the ability of agents to make autonomous decisions in a distributed network through the use of advanced collaboration mechanisms. Moreover, because of the highly instable and dynamic environment of today's supply chains, planning agents must handle multiple problem solving approaches. This paper proposes a Multi-behavior planning agent model using different planning strategies when decisions are supported by a distributed planning system. The implementation of this solution is realized through the FOR@C experimental agent-based platform, dedicated to supply chain planning for the lumber industry. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

922,"Transitioning to more sustainable operations is widely considered to be among the premier challenges facing the chemical industry today. The motivators for such change include an increasingly tightening regulatory regime, increased consumer awareness, and inclination of investors to consider risks associated with lendings to hazardous material industries. As an effort to become ""greener"", chemical industries are making conscious efforts to reduce their resource intensities or footprints. Such efforts need to be supported by models that can quantify the broad economic and environmental implications of industrial decisions. This manuscript uses the recently developed Ecologically Based Life Cycle Assessment (EcoLCA) model of the United States economy to analyze resource intensities of chemical industry sectors, comparing them with each other and with other industry sectors. The raw numbers are normalized by national flows to gain insight into possible resource vulnerabilities of industrial sectors. These numbers are also aggregated based on their mass or exergy to reduce their dimensionality and permit easier interpretation. Ecological cumulative exergy consumption (ECEC) allows consideration of a wide variety of ecosystem goods and services, human resources and emissions and their impacts on a consistent basis, and is shown to provide unique insight in addition to conventional measures based on mass and Industrial cumulative exergy consumption (ICEC). Ratios of ECEC to money indicate the relative throughputs of natural to economic capital, and are used for investigating supply chains of selected sectors and identifying likely keystone sectors. The insights obtained by juxtaposing resource intensities of chemical industry sectors amongst themselves and with those of the rest of economy are used to identify opportunities for reducing resources intensities of chemical industry sectors that could enable improvement of their environmental sustainability. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

923,"Reverse supply chains for the reuse, recycling, and disposal of goods are globalizing. This article critically reviews the environmental, economic, and social issues associated with international reuse and recycling of personal computers. Computers and other e-waste are often exported for reuse and recycling abroad. On the environmental side, our analysis suggests that the risk of leaching of toxic materials in computers from well-managed sanitary landfills is very small. On the other hand, there is an increasing body of scientific evidence that the environmental impacts of informal recycling in developing countries are serious. On the basis of existing evidence informal recycling is the most pressing environmental issue associated with e-waste. Socially, used markets abroad improve access to information technology by making low-priced computers available. Economically, the reuse and recycling sector provides employment. Existing policies efforts to manage e-waste focus on mandating domestic recycling systems and reducing toxic content of processes. We argue that existing policy directions will mitigate but not solve the problem of the environmental impacts of informal recycling.

926,"Planning and Scheduling are the interrelated manufacturing functions and should be solved simultaneously to achieve the real motives of integration in manufacturing. In this paper, we have addressed the advanced integrated planning and scheduling problem in a rapidly changing environment, where the selection of outsourcing machine/operation, meeting the customers (single or multiple) due date, minimizing the makespan are the main objectives while satisfying several technological constraints. We developed a mixed integer programming model for integrated planning and scheduling across the outsourcing supply chain and showed how such models can be used to make strategic decisions. It is a computationally complex and mathematically intractable problem to solve. In this paper, a Chaos-based fast Tabu-simulated annealing (CFTSA) incorporating the features of SA, Tabu and Chaos theory is proposed and applied to solve a large number of problems with increased complexity. In CFTSA algorithm, five types of perturbation schemes are developed and Cauchy probability function is used to escape from local minima and achieve the optimal/near optimal solution in a lesser number of iterations.

927,"Purpose - Global supply chains are more risky than domestic supply chains due to numerous links interconnecting a wide network of firms. These links are prone to disruptions, bankruptcies, breakdowns, macroeconomic and political changes, and disasters leading to higher risks and making risk management difficult. The purpose of this paper is to explore the phenomenon of risk management and risk management strategies in global supply chains. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is based on an extensive literature review and a qualitative study comprising 14 in-depth interviews and a focus group meeting with senior supply chain executives. Findings - The study provides insights into the applicability of six risk management strategies with respect to environmental conditions and the role of three moderators. Research limitations/implications - The model is developed in a global manufacturing supply chain context. It should be tested in other contexts and with other methods to provide generalizability. The study takes a much needed step toward building a theory of risk management in global supply chains, which opens important future research directions. Practical implications - This research provides direction to managers for choosing risk management strategies based on the global supply chain environment. Moderators have practical implications for global supply chain managers.

929,"To avert risk, today's companies perform business with little capital investment. They invest only on the core activities which gain higher profit and outsource non-critical production activities to their partner companies (subcontractors or sourcing companies). Hence, a customer order is normally completed by a collaborative production network formed by the partner companies. However, co-ordinating those loosely and distributed companies to meet the uncertain demands from the final customers is not simple. This research suggests an order confirmation mechanism that allows synchronizing the available capacities over the supply network. The mechanism is developed based on a factory agent system and a design of three protocols: (1) protocol for normal condition, (2) protocol for abnormal condition, and (3) protocol for cancellation. Based on the protocols, messages and procedures are designed. The design is also deployed on a distributed computing environment to illustrate the feasibility and applicability.",10.1080/00207540600844019,International Journal of Production Research,Agent-based manufacturing systems | Communication protocols | Distributed production planning | Order Management | Product production structure,36248943462,Order confirmation mechanism for collaborative production networks,2008.0
930,"Reverse auctions in business-to-business (B2B) exchanges provide numerous benefits to participants. Arguably the most notable benefit is that of lowered prices driven by increased competition in such auctions. The competition between sellers in reverse auctions has been analyzed using a game-theoretic framework and equilibria have been established for several scenarios. One finding of note is that, in a setting in which sellers can meet total demand with the highest-bidding seller being able to sell only a fraction of the total capacity, the sellers resort to a mixed-strategy equilibrium. Although price randomization in industrial bidding is an accepted norm, one might argue that in reality managers do not utilize advanced game theory calculations in placing bids. More likely, managers adopt simple learning strategies. In this situation, it remains an open question as to whether the bid prices converge to the theoretical equilibrium over time. To address this question, we model reverse-auction bidding behavior by artificial agents as both two-player and n-player games in a simulation environment. The agents begin the game with a minimal understanding of the environment but over time analyze wins and losses for use in determining future bids. To test for convergence, the agents explore the price space and exploit prices where profits are higher, given varying cost and capacity scenarios. In the two-player case, the agents do indeed converge toward the theoretical equilibrium. The n-player case provides results that reinforce our understanding of the theoretical equilibria. These results are promising enough to further consider the use of artificial learning mechanisms in reverse auctions and other electronic market transactions, especially as more sophisticated mechanisms are developed to tackle real-life complexities. We also develop the analytical results when one agent does not behave strategically while the other agent does and show that our simulations for this environment also result in convergence toward the theoretical equilibrium. Because the nature of the best response in the new setting is very different (pure strategy as opposed to mixed), it indicates the robustness of the devised algorithm. The use of artificial agents can also overcome the limitations in rationality demonstrated by human managers. The results thus have interesting implications for designing artificial agents in automating bid responses for large numbers of bids where human intervention might not always be possible. © 2008, Decision Sciences Institute.",10.1111/j.1540-5915.2008.00181.x,Decision Sciences,B2B e-Commerce | Strategic decision making | Supply chain-information systems interface,41549103804,Reverse auctions with multiple reinforcement learning agents,2008.0
931,"Agent-based simulation, advanced planning and scheduling, lumber supply chain. Recent developments in supply chain planning have emerged from the field of agent technology and distributed decision making. Although several attempts have been made to exploit agent technology to design supply chain simulation tools, the integration of simulation with distributed supply chain planning tools is still a challenge. This paper aims at investigating this aspect of supply chain planning simulation through the use of theoretical contributions found in the field of simulation, systems theory, distributed decision making and agent-based software engineering. More specifically, this paper first proposes a conceptual framework for modeling ""distributed agent-based Advanced Planning and Scheduling"" (d-APS). Next, derived from this framework, it proposes some specific methods for understanding and modeling simulation problems at the initial phase of the modeling effort. This early phase is critical because it considerably influences the whole development process and the resulting simulation environment, but it is usually neglected in the concerned literature.

932,"Outsourcing has been a very popular strategy in many industries to reduce production costs and allow companies to focus on their core competencies. Unfortunately, there are few models available in the literature that can aid management in the outsourcing decision. This paper presents a model that considers two critical characteristics relevant to the outsourcing decision-making process in manufacturing supply chains: failure costs due to not meeting the production requirements (resulting in lost orders and customers) and operating costs (including fixed costs associated with the management and control of the production stages, as well as the variable unit costs per production stage). The proposed model, motivated by the rapidly growing contract manufacturing environment in the pharmaceutical industry, determines the optimal manufacturing network consisting of in-house and Contract Manufacturers (CMs). The results demonstrate the sensitivity of the outsourcing decision to the reliability, cost of lost production and the replacement ability of the manufacturing network. Specifically, we show that when manufacturing network is unreliable parallel processing can result in lower total costs. Also, high failure costs results in redundant production and parallel processing.

933,"© Emerald Group Publishing Limited. Purpose - The purpose of this study is to use current literature in conjunction with the insights from a detailed analysis of current practice to clarify and extend the knowledge of networks of clusters. Design/methodology/approach - This research is an exploratory study of cluster formation and global competitiveness. By applying cluster and network theory, this study examines critical elements of high-technology networks and clusters. A case study of two clusters in Taiwan and two in China reveals both intra- and inter-cluster network relationships. Findings - This research concludes that networks of clusters do exist and they carry potential advantages for both firms’ and clusters’ competitive advantage and innovation. Close network relationships and interdependences of industrial clusters have contributed significantly to the competitiveness of high-technology clusters in the Asia-Pacific region. Research limitations/implications - Further research is needed to determine what conditions best promote inter-cluster networks and when such networks are likely to generate the most value. Practical implications - First, the relationship among firms in an industrial cluster may be viewed as not only extended supply chains but also as more complex network forms. Firms in a cluster may work together to co-evolve for the purpose of enhancing competitiveness. This process is worthy of further attention from managers looking to more rapidly develop the competitiveness of their firms. Second, the industrial clusters offer a relatively favorable environment that allows the participating firms to more easily pool the resources, investments, and synergies necessary for them to become competitive in the global arena. Third, to the extent that specialization may increase comparative advantage, an industrial cluster can concentrate firms and industries in a region dedicated to a particular product or competence. Finally, once a cluster successfully pools the resources and develops the core products and competences, the phenomena of networks of clusters is likely to emerge for participating parties to share complementarities across both national and geographical boundaries. Originality/value - Most studies on high-technology clusters are focused on intra-cluster interaction. This study broadens the scope of analysis to explore the inter-cluster network structure that enhances global competitiveness of both firms and clusters in an effective and efficient manner.

934,"Avian influenza viruses are now widely recognized as important threats to agricultural biosecurity and public health, and as the potential source for pandemic human influenza viruses. Human infections with avian influenza viruses have been reported from Asia (H5N1, H5N2, H9N2), Africa (H5N1, H10N7), Europe (H7N7, H7N3, H7N2), and North America (H7N3, H7N2, H11N9). Direct and indirect public health risks from avian influenzas are not restricted to the highly pathogenic H5N1 ""bird flu"" virus, and include low pathogenic as well as high pathogenic strains of other avian influenza virus subtypes, e. g., H1N1, H7N2, H7N3, H7N7, and H9N2. Research has shown that the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic was caused by an H1N1 influenza virus of avian origins, and during the past decade, fatal human disease and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed among persons infected with H5N1 and H7N7 avian influenza viruses. Our ability to accurately assess and map the potential economic and public health risks associated with avian influenza outbreaks is currently constrained by uncertainties regarding key aspects of the ecology and epidemiology of avian influenza viruses in birds and humans, and the mechanisms by which highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses are transmitted between and among wild birds, domestic poultry, mammals, and humans. Key factors needing further investigation from a risk management perspective include identification of the driving forces behind the emergence and persistence of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses within poultry populations, and a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms regulating transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses between industrial poultry farms and backyard poultry flocks. More information is needed regarding the extent to which migratory bird populations to contribute to the transnational and transcontinental spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, and the potential for wild bird populations to serve as reservoirs for highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. There are still uncertainties regarding the epidemiological and ecological mechanisms that regulate ""spill-over"" and ""spill-back"" transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses between poultry and wild bird populations, and the interspecies transmission of avian influenza from infected birds to humans and other species of mammals. Further investigations are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of poultry vaccination programs for the control and eradication of avian influenza in poultry populations at the national and regional level, and the effect of long term poultry vaccination programs on human public health risks from avian influenza viruses. There is a need to determine risk factors associated with the extent of direct human involvement in the spread and proliferation of avian influenza viruses through commercial supply chain and transportation networks, and specific risk factors associated with domestic and international trade in live poultry, captive wild birds, poultry food products, (meat, eggs), poultry by-products (feathers, poultry meal), poultry manure, and poultry litter. Addressing these issues will greatly enhance our ability to implement economically and ecologically sustainable programs for the control of avian influenza outbreaks in wild and domesticated birds, increase our capability for promoting the protection of wild bird populations from disease and disruption, and help improve food security and public health in countries worldwide.",10.5751/ES-02548-130221,Ecology and Society,Avian influenza | Biosecurity | Epidemiology | Geographic distribution | Health | Risk assessment | Risk mapping,58749106300,Public health and epidemiological considerations for avian influenza risk mapping and risk assessment,2008.0
935,"It is widely accepted that firms play an important stewardship role in addressing sustainable development concerns. A key challenge in this role is to balance the often conflicting pressures created by sustainable development-firm-level economic performance versus environmental degradation and social disruption. Drawing on complexity theory, risk management, stakeholder theory and the innovation dynamics literature, we discuss the problems of integrating sustainable development concerns in the supply chain, specifically the applicability of life cycle assessment (LCA). Many authors have emphasized the importance of the ""cradle to grave"" approach of LCA in optimizing closed-loop supply chains, improving product design and stewardship. Based on two case studies (an agricultural biotechnology and an oil and gas company) with supporting data collected from key stakeholders, we argue that sustainable development pressures have increased complexities and presented ambiguous challenges that many current environmental management techniques cannot adequately address. We provide a framework that addresses these deficiencies and discuss implications for practitioners and management theory. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

936,"Environmental awareness and legislative pressures have made manufacturers responsible for the take-back and end-of-life treatment of their products. To competitively exploit these products, one option is to incorporate used components in ""new"" or remanufactured products. However, this option is partly limited by a firm's ability to assess the reliability of used components. A comprehensive two-step approach is proposed. The first stage phase statistically analyzes the behavior of components for reuse. A well-known reliability assessment method, the Weibull analysis, is applied to the time-to-failure data to assess the mean life of components. In the second phase, the degradation and condition monitoring data are analyzed by developing an artificial neural network (ANN) model. The advantages of this approach over traditional approaches employing multiple regression analysis are highlighted with empirical data from a consumer product. Finally, the Weibull analysis and the ANN model are then integrated to assess the remaining useful life of components for reuse. This is a critical advance in sustainable management of supply chains since it allows for a better understanding of not only service requirements of product, but the remaining life in a product and hence its suitability for reuse or remanufacture. Future work should assess: (1) reduction in downtime of process equipment through the implementation of this technique as a means to better manage preventative maintenance; (2) reduce field failure of remanufactured product; (3) selling-service strategy through implementation of the proposed methodology. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

937,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to show that a proactive sourcing strategy can be just as important as a proactive marketing strategy in achieving sustainable competitive advantage. Design/methodology/approach The paper reports on action research carried out in the UK beef industry, with a focus on the food service supply chain. The methodology is inductive and qualitative, using a multi-case, multi-site approach. The supply chains presented in the case were analysed from farm gate to consumer, interviewing multiple participants at each stage of the supply chain. Findings This study offers some partial support for configuration-based approaches. However, the case also raises some doubts about the validity of configuration thinking, as it is not the complexity or ambiguity of the relationships that is key in the case, but the fact that brand ownership and contracts create property rights for their owner that create a relatively permanent power resource for Pioneer, the case study company, in its market struggle with its customers and competitors. This interpretation supports the power and property rights views of strategic management rather than the configuration approach. Research limitations/implications The research is based upon in-depth knowledge of the UK beef and red meat industry. It would be beneficial if further in-depth studies could be undertaken in other agri-food supply chains to further validate the findings. Practical implications Although the focus of this article has been upon choosing appropriate sourcing strategies, the case study has also illustrated the importance for business managers of linking this sourcing strategy with a firm's marketing, and more specifically its branding strategy. Originality/value The paper analyses the key differences in demand, supply and power and leverage characteristics in the food service beef supply chain to highlight the need for government agencies, think-tanks and industry participants to have a more robust understanding of industries before advocating the adoption of any one approach for all UK agri-food supply chains.

938,"Using a supply chain network, we demonstrate the feasibility, viability, and robustness of applying machine learning and genetic algorithms to respectively model, understand, and optimize such data intensive environments. Deployment of these algorithms, which learn from and optimize data, can obviate the need to perform more complex, expensive, and time consuming design of experiments (DOE), which usually disrupt system operations. We apply and compare the behavior and performance of the proposed machine learning algorithms to that obtained via DOE in a simulated Vendor Managed Replenishment system, developed for an actual firm. The results show that the models resulting from the proposed algorithms had strong explanatory and predictive power, comparable to that of DOE. The optimal system settings and profit were also similar to that obtained from DOE. The virtues of using machine learning and evolutionary algorithms to model and optimize data rich environments thus seem promising because they are automatic, involving little human intervention and expertise. We believe and are exploring how they can be made adaptive to improve parameter estimates with increasing data, as well as seamlessly detecting system (and therefore model) changes, thus being capable of recursively updating and reoptimizing a modified or new model. © 2006.",10.1016/j.ejor.2006.03.040,European Journal of Operational Research,Decision support systems | Genetic algorithms | Machine learning | Supply chain management | Support vector machines,33846369793,Modeling and optimizing a vendor managed replenishment system using machine learning and genetic algorithms,2007.0
939,"Knowledge is an increasingly significant factor of production in modern agriculture. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) can accelerate agricultural development by facilitating knowledge management. Based on an evaluation of several ICT initiatives in rural India, a framework to guide policy and implementation of ICTs in Indian agriculture is proposed. In this framework, agricultural development is visualized from two perspectives, a rural incomes and livelihoods perspective at the farm level, and a sustainability perspective at the regional level. The implementation of ICTs is proposed in three unique institutional environments: (i) closed vertical supply chain network for agribusiness enterprises, (ii) an open chain network with dynamically evolving partners and supply chain situations for the public, non-governmental and multilateral organizations, and (iii) a spatial data services network to address natural resources management and sustainability concerns. Each environment is assessed to identify its appropriate business models centered around ICTs, required technologies, scope for up-scaling the models, and required institutional and policy initiatives. In the future, as ICT infrastructure grows and connectivity and hardware costs decline, the critical constraints are likely to be the development of appropriate policy and institutional environments for the creation and delivery of information and knowledge to the end users. Significant policy, institutional networking and capacity building initiatives will be required at various levels to overcome the constraints and effectively integrate ICTs into the agricultural development process in India. © 2006.",10.1016/j.techfore.2006.02.002,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,Agriculture | Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) | Rural incomes | Sustainable development,34147109233,A framework for implementing information and communication technologies in agricultural development in India,2007.0
940,"Timber scarcity relates to the evolution of stocks in both natural forests and tree plantations, relative to the demand from timber processing industries. Several economic indicators are used to evaluate timber scarcity. In particular, the market price of timber stumpage is believed to send a signal to investors in timber growing and to further regulate mill investments, thus preventing industrial overcapacities from emerging relative to future available wood supply. Our analysis of the Indonesian Pulp and Paper industry, one that expanded impressively in the 1990's and installed large overcapacities, gives us the elements to discuss the applicability of market price as a scarcity signal. Specific conditions, usually found in the developing world, most importantly weak or compromised public governance, flawed corporate governance, and the monopsony character of wood supply mechanisms, prevent the development of a market price scarcity signal. In this paper, special attention is paid to the complexity of the wood supply chain and the nature of the actors involved. This, together with the absence of pricing transparency, allows industrial overcapacities to occur, leading to the depletion of the natural forest. A key unresolved mystery here is why the private capital providers made no effort to detect this obvious and critical risk to the repayment capacity of their investments. The apparent absence of any government role in enforcing sustainable harvest or capacity levels results from state capture and governance failure, topics fully discussed elsewhere in the Indonesian case. The situation has implications for supply modeling as well as for public and private policies. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - This research follows a constructivist approach, based on the following activities: recompilation, analysis and study of scientific knowledge, acquisition of main postulates and construction of initial framework. Findings - This paper describes a performance measurement system called PMS-EN that can be used for managing performance in the enterprise networks context. After analysing different frameworks relating to such a thematic, and once their main weaknesses were identified, it was decided to develop a PMS that will overcome these difficulties and, at the same time, provide enterprises operating within these environments, with a simple, efficient, robust and useful framework. Research limitations/implications - This PMS has been built upon the framework called PMS IE-GIP, but thought could be given to building it upon other frameworks existing within the literature. Practical implications - Even though this proposal has been successfully applied to an enterprises network, it should be tested further by implementing it to other enterprises networks, with the main objective of enriching and extending it to other sectors. Originality/value - This paper has described a new performance measurement system called PMS-EN that can be used for managing performance in the enterprise networks context. It provides enterprises operating in this context a simple, efficient, robust and useful framework.

942,"Modern businesses in the maritime transport industry are interfacing with a dynamic, increasingly complex, information-driven world. Information and knowledge are increasingly the intangible assets on which business sustainability and growth are founded. Knowledge is a dynamic, social resource. Trading networks are significant communities of practice. To create new knowledge from these, firms utilize learning contexts. In these learning contexts, participants interact and identify, capture and share new information. The learning context needs to facilitate the prevalence of these processes. The role and significance of the context to the capture and sharing of business learning and lifelong learning is considered in this paper. It investigates critical issues in the management of this learning context to enhance competitive advantage in supply chains and networks. Given the current and potential future skills shortages in the industry, key policy implications, such as the integration of work experience into the learning cycle, encouraging lifelong learning and the provision of dual sector pathways are outlined.",10.1080/03088830701240391,Maritime Policy and Management,,34248361092,Capturing and sharing knowledge in supply chains in the maritime transport sector: Critical issues,2007.0
943,"During the last few decades, companies have moved away from hierarchical, integrated supply chains in favor of fragmented networks of strategic partnerships with external entities. This change has caused ripples throughout the old supply network and raised questions about the future. The authors consider the impact of vertical disinteJ gration in large-scale supply networks, particularly in the textile and electronics industries. They focus on supply chain strategies that have been adopted by network players in order to accommodate for the changing governance and ownership structures. Their broad hypothesis is that the process of disin tegration in many industries is not sustainable from a coordination and control viewpoint, and therefore will be followed by eventual reintegration -although it may take different forms in different industries. They discuss the expanded role of the systems integrator, which, in many cases, goes beyond critical coordination services and extends into issues related to control and governance of portions of the supply network. They also explore the challenges that systems integrators are likely to face, and they contrast two different models of coordination and governance that could be adopted by such players.

944,"Supplier networks and the buyer/supplier relationships that comprise them are becoming increasingly important to effective supply chain management. Trust, collaboration, and efficient sharing of information are critical for true win/win relationships to surface in an environment where there is constant pressure to reduce costs and still maintain reasonable profitability. The use of across-the-board cost reduction demands and simple market clout may not always be the most effective approach in the long run. This paper describes linear performance pricing (LPP), a tool developed for a major automobile OEM in an attempt to effectively and efficiently provide more focused supply cost reductions. LPP is a data-driven methodology relying on a series of regression analyses that McKinsey and Company [2006. Automotive and assembly glossary. 〈http://autoassembly.mckinsey.com/html/resources/glossary/1.asp〉 (accessed 15.01.06)] describes as a ""measurement tool that establishes a relationship between the value provided by a given part (performance) and its price."" We maintain that LPP facilitates a collaborative effort on the part of both the buyer and supplier and has the potential for leveraging the increased visibility of the buyer within the supplier network with respect to tier one or tier two suppliers. It helps by focusing cost reduction efforts of the tier one suppliers and provides lateral market visibility they may not have otherwise. Although widely used throughout the automotive industry in the US and Europe, little discussion of LPP is found in the literature. To promote a better understanding of LPP, we present a detailed example and discuss the managerial implications of the approach. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

945,"Purpose The purpose of this research paper is to offer a solution to differentiate supply chain planning for products with different demand features and in different life-cycle phases. Design/methodology/approach A normative framework for selecting a planning approach was developed based on a literature review of supply chain differentiation and supply chain planning. Explorative mini-cases from three companies – Vaisala, Mattel, Inc. and Zara – were investigated to identify the features of their innovative planning solutions. The selection framework was applied to the case company's new business unit dealing with a product portfolio of highly innovative products as well as commodity items. Findings The need for planning differentiation is essential for companies with large product portfolios operating in volatile markets. The complexity of market, channel and supply networks makes supply chain planning more intricate. The case company provides an example of using the framework for rough segmentation to differentiate planning. Research limitations/implications The paper widens Fisher's supply chain selection framework to consider the aspects of planning. Practical implications Despite substantial resources being used, planning results are often not reliable or consistent enough to ensure cost efficiency and adequate customer service. Therefore there is a need for management to critically consider current planning solutions.

946,"The schedule for manufacturing and its delivery should be strategically determined to maintain economic and sustainable management of a supply chain. However, most of existing design models for the supply chain assumes that it is known or pre-specified when products are manufactured and delivered, and therefore, only the amount of products and delivery are of interest to optimize within design frameworks. In order to provide high flexibility and cost-effectiveness in manufacturing and supply chain activities, both timing information (i.e., when to produce and deliver) and capacity (i.e., how much to produce and deliver) need to be considered simultaneously. New MILP (mixed integer linear programming) model for the design and optimization of the supply chain has been proposed, in which these two key decision variables are simultaneously optimized. For dealing with computational difficulties resulted from the large-size problem, a sequentially-updating procedure is also proposed. In this sequentially-updating procedure, the whole distribution network is divided into subsystems and optimized interactively within iterative procedure, where each subsystem is sequentially optimized until no profit improvement is observed. The enhanced flexibility of the supply chain can be obtained from this improved design philosophy. This also ensures reliable and robust responsiveness of the supply chain to customers' demand without sacrificing efficiency and/or cost-effectiveness of manufacturing and delivery activities. Illustrated case studies show that the proposed method is able to deal with large and complex supply chain problems with significant cost savings. © 2007 Institution of Chemical Engineers.",10.1016/S0263-8762(07)73206-9,Chemical Engineering Research and Design,Flexible schedule | Operation | Optimization | Supply chain,38549114069,Optimization for intelligent operation of supply chains,2007.0
947,"Many businesses fail to recognize the strategic importance of sourcing decisions. Companies often focus on the price and quality of goods provided to them, but it is easy to overlook the social and environmental standards of suppliers. Those who do may find themselves on the receiving end of aggressive attacks from a range of stakeholders, from customers and shareholders to the news media. Indeed, the business practices of Georgia Pacific, a hardwood plywood supplier, were at the heart of actions by the Rainforest Action Network aimed at disrupting operations at Home Depot; the practices of tomato growers that supplied Taco Bell restaurants were behind boycotts of the fast food giant; and fishing practices that endangered dolphins were the source of discontent with the tuna industry. Clearly the business practices of key suppliers can readily tarnish a corporate reputation, and the strategic impact - potentially including business disruption, business interruption, and even business failure - of neglecting these perceptions needs to be recognized by present and future business leaders. In order to examine the dynamics of change brought about as a result of negative stakeholder perceptions of supply management practices, we looked at the college and university athletic apparel industry, which between 1996 and 2001 came under scrutiny for dealing with suppliers and supply chains that produced goods in foreign factories with poor working conditions. When negative reactions escalated, the universities became the focus of activities aimed at changing the practices of their suppliers. This conflict was played out in the media, providing a solid approach - through discourse analysis - to investigating the events and reactions on both sides of the conflict. Our findings show that inattention to the practices of an organization's suppliers should serve to caution business leadership. Conversely, we show that a proactive stance toward managing supplier practices can serve to provide for successful resolution of stakeholder concerns regarding an organization's outsourcing.

948,"Demand for alternative feedstocks for fuels, chemicals, and a range of commercial products has grown dramatically in the early years of the 21st century, driven by the high price of petroleum, government policy to promote alternatives and reduce dependence on foreign oil, and growing efforts to reduce net emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Ethanol production has more than tripled since 2000, with annual US production expected to exceed 7 billion gallons by 2007. Sales of biobased plastics are also expanding. The growing availability of economically competitive biobased alternatives to petroleum can be attributed in large part to advances in the production and processing of corn grain for industrial uses. Steady increases in corn yields made possible by agricultural biotechnology continue to expand the supply of available grainbased feedstock. Rapid advances in the field of industrial biotechnology are greatly enhancing the efficiency of ethanol production and making possible a range of new biobased polymers, plastics, and textiles from agricultural starting materials. In order to meet the US Department of Energy (DOE) goal of 60 million gallons of ethanol production and 30 percent displacement of petroleum by 2030, new feedstock sources will be required to supplement high-efficiency production from grain. A robust sustainable supply chain for cellulosic biomass from agricultural residues and dedicated energy crops will be needed within a few years.Nearly 1 billion dry tons of cellulosic biomass could be supplied by US agricultural lands in the form of crop residues and dedicated energy crops. A growing list of companies have announced intentions to begin construction of cellulosic biorefinerics. One challenge for the emerging cellulosic biomass industry is how to produce, harvest, and deliver this abundant feedstock to biorefineries in an economically and environmentally sustainable way. Corn stover and straw from cereals such as wheat and rice are the most likely cellulosic Feedstocks for commercial-scale production of ethanol in the near term, potentially supplying more than 200 million dry tons of feedstock annually within three to five years-enough to triple current ethanol production. Dedicated energy crops such as switchgrass will follow as a feedstock supplement once a market for cellulosic biomass develops further. Corn stover has the largest potential as a near-term biorefinery feedstock, given its high per-acre yields. Current cropping practices require that most or all stover remain on the field to maintain soil health. As biorefinery construction creates markets for crop residues, farmers will be more motivated to adopt practices that lead to economic and sustainable removal. An environmental and economic ""optimum"" removal will balance sufficient retention of residues to avoid erosion losses and maintain soil quality while using excess residue as biorefinery feedstocks. The impact of varying levels of stover and straw removal will depend considerably on local conditions and practices.Under a range of conditions, no-till cropping allows for substantially greater residue collection than current practice, enabling biorefinery siting in areas where suitable supplies are currently unavailable. Further evolution toward greater no-till cropping is needed in order to supply adequate feedstock while complying with erosion guidelines and maintaining soil quality. Lower operating costs and recent successes have spurred an increase in adoption of no-till, with 16 percent of wheat acreage and 20 percent of corn acreage now under no-till practice. However, no-till is not yet widely utilized in regions of the country with the greatest potential to supply biomass. Ultimately, growing demand for crop residues will likely prove a strong additional driver for the transition to more widespread no-till cropping. Once a market for agricultural residues develops, individual farmers or groups of farmers may elect to adopt no-till cropping to attract biorefineries to their area. Residue collection may also enable no-till cropping in wetter regions, such as the northern Com Belt, where excess residues currently hamper germination and reduce yields. While the economics depend on regional and local conditions, for those not currently practicing no-till, the benefits of converting may justiry the time to learn new methods and the $50,000-$100,000 investment in new planting equipment. For instance, a 1,000-acre farm could expect to recover the additional costs through revenue from residue sales in as little as two years. New markets that commoditize the environmental benefits of notill farming could provide even greater incentive to convert. Carbon credits for no-till transition currently sell for roughly $1 per acre on the voluntary Chicago Climate Exchange. If mandatory greenhouse gas limits are established in the United States, the carbon credit benefits of no-till adoption could exceed $10 per acre. In addition to economic benefits for farmers, sustainable production, and collection of agricultural residues has the potential to deliver substantial benefits for the environment, such as reduced runoff of soil and fertilizers. But the greatest environmental benefit may be to the global climate through reduced emissions of fossil carbon and enhanced sequestration of soil carbon. With no-till cropping, sustainable collection of 30 percent of current annual corn stover production would yield over 5 billion gallons of ethanol and reduce net US greenhouse gas emissions by 90 million to 150 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent annually, if burned as E85 fuel. This would more than offset the net annual growth in emissions from all sectors of the US economy experienced in 2004. To realize these benefits, additional infrastructure in collection, storage, and transportation is needed to supply biorefineries. Rail transport greatly reduces transportation costs relative to trucking, allowing for a much larger collection area. One-pass harvest, in which grain and residues are collected simultaneously, also offers strong opportunities to lower cost.To facilitate development of the infrastructure necessary for sustainable production and collection of cellulosic agricultural feed-stocks, and to achieve the DOE goal of 30 percent displacement of petroleum with renewable biobased feedstocks by 2030, the US Congress should consider adopting supportive policy measures in the 2007 Farm Bill, including: Funding for accelerated development and production of onepass harvesting equipment Development and distribution of simple-to-use soil carbon models to allow farmers to compute how much crop residue can be collected without degrading soil quality Assistance to farmers to encourage the transition to no-till cropping for biomass production Incentives for the development and expansion of short-line and regional rail networks Funding for demonstration projects to streamline collection, transport, and storage of cellulosic crop residue feedstocks Development of a system to monetize greenhouse gas credits generated by production of ethanol and other products from agricultural feedstocks Funding for programs to help farmers identify and grow the most suitable crops for both food production and cellulosic biomass production Cellulosic biomass from agricultural residues and dedicated energy crops represents a highly promising new source of feedstock material for the production of ethanol, renewable chemicals, and a range of commercial biobased products. Residues from existing crops can be utilized to greatly expand current biofuels production.",10.1089/ind.2006.2.257,Industrial Biotechnology,,33846707541,Achieving sustainable production of agricultural biomass for biorefinery feedstock,2006.0
949,"Purpose - For manufacturing enterprises, today's business environment is characterised by globally dispersed supply and manufacturing networks. In addition, the level of variety in products continues to increase in almost all sectors. Greater understanding of the management of product variety in international operations is required. Aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach - A generic simulation model representing a multinational corporation (MNC) supply chain is used to investigate the impact on supply chain performance of increasing product variety in combination with supply lead-time and demand uncertainty in an international setting. The simulation focuses on the upstream activities of production planning, inbound supply and manufacturing. The structure and logic of the simulation model are based on insights obtained from an empirical study of real MNC supply networks. Findings - The study shows that increasing the level of product variety has a detrimental impact on supply chain performance. In the presence of supply lead-time and demand uncertainty, high levels of variety result in much longer flow times and much higher system inventory relative to more stable conditions. The impact is greatest when variety involves critical materials which are required early in the production process and that entail long set-up times. Research limitations/implications - The study could be extended to incorporate more advanced inventory control models, the inclusion of downstream activities, multiple manufacturing sites and multiple potential supply routes. Practical implications - Implications for the selection of suppliers and for inventory control policies are discussed in the context of international operations. The potential value of postponement strategies and the need in some cases for fundamental product and process redesign to mitigate the negative impacts of variety are highlighted. Originality/value - Managing product variety in the context of international operations has received very little attention to date in the research literature.

Due to the fact that WSNs are composed of a large number of low-cost and energy-constrained sensor nodes, along with the notorious time-varying and error-prone nature of wireless links, scalable, robust and energy-efficient data dissemination techniques are needed for the emerging WSN applications such as environment monitoring and surveillance. In this paper, we examine this emerging field from the point of view of supply chain management and propose a hybrid data dissemination framework for WSNs. In particular, for each sensing task, the whole sensor field is conceptually partitioned into several functional regions based on the supply chain management methodology. Different routing schemes are applied to different regions in order to provide better performance in terms of reliability and energy consumption. For this purpose, we also propose a novel zone flooding scheme, essentially a combination of conventional geometric routing and flooding techniques.

953,"In today's growing complexity of global networks of supply chains and hypercompetitive business environments, firms are confronted with the need to manage supply chain activities across functions and between firms. While prior research has noted the benefits of collaboration between functional areas for enhanced supply chain performance, there is not yet empirical evidence on whether an orientation toward working collectively among different functions for a firm's supply chain could influence customer satisfaction and supply chain responsiveness. A structured questionnaire was administered to U.K.-based food service suppliers, and 112 usable mail responses were obtained. Measures supporting cross-functional orientation (CFO) were developed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, and hypotheses were tested via path analysis. The findings show that a CFO positively affects customer satisfaction and supply chain responsiveness. The length of Internet adoption was also found to play a critical role in enhancing CFO, through positive moderating relationships with customer satisfaction and supply chain responsiveness. © November 2005, by the Institute for Supply Management, Inc.™.",10.1111/j.1745-493X.2005.04104002.x,Journal of Supply Chain Management,,27844539871,The influence of a firm's cross-functional orientation on supply chain performance,2005.0
954,"The last decades, advances in information technologies and increased competition have changed the business environment in the food and beverages industry, particularly in the European Union, which is characterised by the proliferation of small and medium enterprises. Many food companies are now aggressively focusing on logistics management as the last frontier to gain and sustain a competitive advantage. This study describes a model of intelligent food supply chain that improves efficiency within the supply chain. The aim of the paper is to demonstrate that agent technology can optimise food supply chains by (a) reviewing intelligent agents applications for supply chain optimisation and (b) illustrating how a multi-agent system can optimise performance of a beverage logistics network. Firstly, we review and synthesise existing applications in comparison to traditional and Internet-based technologies and critically evaluate agent technology applicability for supply chain management. We model the beer supply network to demonstrate that products can acquire intelligence to direct themselves throughout the distribution network. Optimisation agents can help solve specific problems of beverage supply: reduce inventories and lessen bullwhip effect, improve communication, and enable chain coordination without adverse risk sharing. Further, they gain a capability to be purchased and sold while in transit. Overviews of the supporting technologies that make such a supply chain a reality are fully discussed. In particular, optimisation agents have the characteristics of autonomous action, being proactive, reactive, and able to communicate. We demonstrate that agents enhance the flexibility, information visibility, and efficiency of the supply chain management. Suggestions and recommendations for further research are provided. Simulations of the agent-enabled supply optimisation can be used to benchmark for future research and development associated with building an optimisation agent. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

955,"Current research in interorganizational information systems (IOS) for B2B eCommerce tends to focus on the factors that lead to the intention to adopt these systems. One important factor is the IT capability of a network member in the supply chain, but the extant literature is silent on the nature of the link between this factor and the intention to adopt. This paper contributes to the research literature by a critical approach that examines in detail the structure, dynamics and complexity of the link between them. Based on the literature review we suggest six mediating factors between IT capability and its intention to increase the sophistication of its business-to-business integration (B2Bi). We develop a relational model of network atmosphere and network structure, which between them, encompass these factors. Based on the model and previous research findings, we justify 12 propositions grouped into three sets which has the following contributions. First, it has proposed an integrated model which allows us to understand the interaction between factors in a firm's environment and factors inside a firm. Second, the structural model has firstly posited external factors as the mediating variables interacting with each other along the proposed links.

957,"Purpose - The purpose of the present paper is to provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing relationships among economic actors interconnected through internet and constituting e-supply networks (e-SNs). Design/methodology/approach - At first the main factors characterizing e-SN pattern are identified (organizational structures, managerial criteria and critical activities), then two separate procedures are adopted for developing an integrated reference framework. The first based on the analysis of correlations among variables influencing the factors under investigation; the second based on the analysis of different types of physical and immaterial flows among actors involved in the e-SN. On the basis of such evidence an integrated global framework is proposed, which is then used to classify and describe some relevant literature-based case studies. Findings - On the basis of two newly introduced variables, namely the internal integration degree and the decision-making concentration degree, the framework identifies four sets of organizational structures, managerial criteria and critical activities, each one coherent with specific environmental contexts. Research limitations/implications - The framework is restricted to describing and classifying different typologies of e-SN. Practical implications - The framework may be useful for assessing if the typology of organizational structure, managerial criteria and critical activities adopted for the management of a specific e-SN, is coherent with e-SN business environment. It may also provide useful guidelines for managers and practitioners involved in e-SN design.

Design/methodology/approach - The analytic network process is applied as the research methodology in the context of executive decisions that include qualitative and quantitative attributes. The decision model is presented, along with a case study with an e-supply chain of a global telecommunications company. Findings - The study develops a framework for measuring the relative importance of a particular dimension based on the application of theoretical concepts from the information systems and management science literature to the digital, knowledge economy. Since contextual factors play a critical role in the design of effective knowledge-management (KM) systems, technical and process solutions need to be customized to fit the organization performance criteria, dimensions of agility and supply chain drivers.

Design/methodology/approach – The research was undertaken in accordance with the realist tradition. It begins with a descriptive exploratory stage involving an in-depth exploratory case study of aerospace industry supply chains, validated through in-depth interviews with managers representing other “critical sectors” of the UK economy. This is followed by an explanatory theoretical stage. The work is supported throughout with reference to relevant literature sources. Findings – The findings highlight the absence of any widespread understanding of the scope of and dynamic nature of the problem, which should be considered from multiple perspectives and at four levels of analysis: value stream/product or process; asset and infrastructure dependencies; organisations and inter-organisational networks; and social and natural environment. Research limitations/implications – The paper is normative rather than positive, so focuses on understanding why supply chains are vulnerable to disruption, rather than presenting itself as a prescription for management. The paper does not investigate academic definitions or existing taxonomies of risk. Practical implications – The work provides some useful insights for practising managers and policy makers.

961,"Increasingly heterogeneous markets, together with shorter product life cycles, are forcing many companies to simultaneously compete in the three domains of product, process, and supply chain. Dependencies among decisions across these domains make this competitive situation very complex. To address this complexity, three-dimensional concurrent engineering (3D-CE) has been suggested ([Fine, C.H., 1998. Clockspeed - Winning Industry Control in the Age of Temporary Advantage. Perseus Books, Reading, MA.]). Applying 3D-CE requires an operationalization of one of its core elements: the product architecture. In this paper, I develop a multi-dimensional framework that enables comprehensive product architecture assessments. The framework builds on existing product characteristic concepts such as component commonality, product platforms, and product modularity. The framework's utility is illustrated with two example products, showing how individual product architecture dimensions link decisions across different domains. This framework can be used to focus advice for product design on product architecture dimensions that are critical for a given operational strategy, to assess advantages and limitations of operational strategies in conjunction with given product architectures, or to develop dynamic capabilities such as planning effective product-operation strategy combinations. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

962,"Fostering and maintaining a win-win relationship with suppliers and other supply chain partners is a daunting task. Various driving forces play a significant role in making this a reality. In this study, we first define the theoretical domain of strategic supply management. Based on an extensive literature review, we then identify the key driving forces that assist buyer firms in making their supply management strategic and successful. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the effect of these driving forces on strategic supply management and the effect of strategic supply management on buyer’s performance. The results provide empirical evidence to the fact that strategic supply management is driven by several critical factors including environmental uncertainty, customer focus, competitive priorities, top management support, information technology and supply network structure. However, uncertainty was not found to be a significant deterrent in the successful management of supply activities. Rather, it was a stepping-stone for preparedness among the supply chain partners. In general, the results of this study provide additional insights for practitioners and researchers in understanding the strategic management of the supply function. © 2005 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",10.1504/IJISM.2005.005953,International Journal of Integrated Supply Management,driving forces | firm performance | strategic supply management,84889771237,Driving forces of strategic supply management: a preliminary empirical investigation,2005.0
963,"With the fast development of information technology and the global market, collaboration between different functional units in a supply chain becomes one of the most critical factors for global companies to respond to rapid changes in customer needs and increase the efficiency of the whole supply chain. This supply chain environment requires a production-distribution planning system to enable the collaboration between production and distribution units more quickly and orderly. Generally, collaboration in a supply chain needs to resolve conflicts between two decentralised functional units, because each unit tries to locally minimise its own costs, not the overall supply chain costs. Also, there exists incomplete information sharing according to the information privacy of each functional unit. This paper proposes a decentralised production-distribution planning system using collaborative agents that can efficiently mediate the planning gaps between two decentralised planning functions: production and distribution.

It is assumed that e-SC performances are influenced by the network organizational structures, by the criteria adopted to manage relationships among involved actors, and by the critical activities that the leading company performs. At first the variables influencing such factors are identified and the interdependencies among them are analysed to establish existing correlations. This, in turn, enables one to group the values of the influencing factors in four coherent sets which are consistent with different business environments, thus assuring the effectiveness and efficiency to the e-SC. The obtained reference model is then tested by applying it to literature-based case studies.

968,"Legionella are aerobic bacteria with ubiquitaire biotope. Several species have been identified; of which the most frequently found in human pathology is the legionella pneumophila. Depending on the circumstances and the individual concerned, the inhalation of air containing the bacteria can provoke a severe pulmonary infection known as Legionnaires' Disease. The declaration of this disease has been obligatory since 1987. The presence of legionella in natural or industrial water environments, and the multiplication in the number of diagnosed cases of legionnaires' disease, has made it an important problem of sanitary hygiene. Despite recent events, many elements still remain to be discovered on legionella. The same can also be said for the approach to the problem as a whole. The interest of this study resides in the adaptation of a methodological approach (HACCP - Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point), and its association with a method of risk assessment (FMECA - Failure Mode and Effects Criticality Analysis). The goal is the better understanding of the situation and to organise the actions to be carried out. The result of this innovative work is the elaboration of a criticality assessment grid for installations. This evaluation is done in line with a table of estimations who criterion are the temperature and the speed of water, the state and types of materials used, the technical characteristics of the network and the bacterial concentration.

970,"An important feature of many complex systems, both natural and artificial, is the structure and organization of their interaction networks with interesting properties. Such networks are found in a variety of applications such as in supply chain networks, computer and communication networks, metabolic networks, food webs, etc. Here, we present a theory of self-organization by evolutionary adaptation in which we show how the structure and organization of a network is related to the survival, or in general the performance, objectives of the system. We propose that a complex system optimizes its network structure in order to maximize its overall survival fitness which is composed of short- and long-term survival components. These in turn depend on three critical measures of the network, namely, efficiency, robustness and cost, and the environmental selection pressure. Fitness maximization by adaptation leads to the spontaneous emergence of optimal network structures, both power law and non-power law, of various topologies depending on the selection pressure. Using a graph theoretical case study, we show that when efficiency is paramount the ""star"" topology emerges and when robustness is important the ""circle"" topology is found. When efficiency and robustness requirements are both important to varying degrees, other classes of networks such as the ""hub"" emerge. This theory provides a general conceptual framework for integrating survival or performance objectives, environmental or selection pressure, evolutionary adaptation, optimization of performance measures and topological features in a single coherent formalism. Our assumptions and results are consistent with observations across a wide variety of applications. This framework lays the ground work for a novel approach to model, design and analyze complex networks, both natural and artificial, such as metabolic pathways, supply chains and communication networks. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

971,"Gravel pre-filters and slow sand filters are robust and reliable unit processes with the potential for broad small community application in the developing world as they are able to provide physical and microbiological treatment. A multi-stage system comprising gravel pre-filters, slow sand filters and terminal disinfection conforms with the multiple barrier concept in relation to pathogen removal. Employing upflow gravel pre-filters as a form of pre-treatment also considerably reduces the risk of the slow sand filter blocking as a result of the surface straining of particles present in the raw water. The performance of a multi-stage treatment system, comprising shallow upflow gravel pre-filters and fabric-enhanced slow sand filters, was investigated both in service and during cleaning operations in a UK-based research project. The pre-filters provided microbial and physical treatment capacity and attenuated peaks in the raw water to the benefit of the slow sand filter. The slow sand filter achieved high levels of pathogen removal in addition to providing further physical treatment. The novel raised floor configuration adopted for the upflow pre-filters enabled high cleaning efficiencies to be achieved by rapid draindown.

972,"Today's automotive leadership faces harsh competitive truths. Six forces will have transformed the automotive world by 2008: (1) an imperative to create value for consumers and shareholders, faster; (2) further consolidation and scale (yet scale alone is not guarantee of success); (3) a greater need for production and process agility, to embrace technological breakthroughs in vehicle engineering; (4) the advent of new disruptive technology in vehicles, and in supply chains; (5) accelerated innovation of products and services; innovation is the differentiator; and (6) Increasing customer expectation of both choice and value. Success in the future will depend on adopting a model that is based on collaborative relationships with suppliers and others. Companies that can assemble the best supply communities and accelerate consumer-centric innovation faster than their competitor's network will be the winners. Collaborative product commerce (CPC) provides the framework under which multiple-company collaborative communities can flourish and deliver long term sustainable value. The transition to a collaborative model requires strategic leadership. The formation of new communities will not happen as a natural evolution from the lower forms of collaboration that currently exist. The benefits of CPC include: shorter cycle times, cost reductions, development of consumer-centric offerings. Six key steps to CPC are: (1) make collaboration the centerpiece of strategy: obtain a community of partners that excel in customer responsiveness, speed to market, and innovation; (2) anticipate the upcoming disruptive forces and create a collaborative response with key community partners rather than in isolation; (3) work with community partners to identify essential areas where collaboration can create a superior business model; (5) begin working with partners first on enhancing product development; (5) focus on core competencies and eliminate redundant processes; and (6) share value within the community.

973,"This paper presents issues critical to the development and successful implementation of computer simulation models for ship component manufacturing within a naval shipyard environment. More specifically, it addresses the need for a supply chain approach to developing simulation models for use as a management tool. The problem domain is the naval shipbuilding industry, which is different from industries associated with traditional manufacturing. Due to the tremendous number of components associated with naval warship construction and the extreme length of the build cycle, managing such an enterprise presents a formidable challenge. As Northrop Grumman Newport News strives to be a lean enterprise, managers will need new tools to address the lean initiatives of the many shops and construction areas within their domain. In this paper, it is suggested that the application of computer simulation using a component supply chain approach could provide management with a powerful tool to improve efficiency. A three-phased approach for the development of an enterprise supply chain model is presented. In the first phase, individual simulation models are developed for manufacturing and material support functions. The second phase addresses the linking of the models into small model networks.

976,"This article addresses the transfer of new product technologies from outside the firm for integration into a new product system as part of a product development effort. Product technology transfer is a key activity in the complex process of new product development and is the fundamental link in the technology supply chain. Product technology transfer too often is dealt with in an ad-hoc fashion. Purposeful- management of the product technology transfer process leads to more effective transfers in terms of timeliness, cost, functional performance, and competence building. Better management of product technology transfer gives firms access to a greater variety of new technology options, improves a firm's ability to offer significantly differentiated products, deepens the firm's competitive competencies, and positively influences sustained product development success. The central objective of this article is to gain insight into product technology transfer so that companies can manage this process more successfully and so that researchers can investigate this critical activity further. This article describes the technology supply chain as a unique form of a supply chain that poses a set of managerial challenges and requirements distinguishing it from the more traditional component supply chain. Because a single product technology transfer project is the fundamental piece in the technology supply chain, understanding this piece well is key to leveraging the extended technology supply chain and to improving overall product development performance. This article integrates literatures on new product development, supply chain management, and technology management and builds on organizational theory to present a conceptual model of determinants of product technology transfer success. The core proposition is that product technology transfer effectiveness is greatest when companies carefully match (or ""fit"") the type of technology to be transferred (the ""technology uncertainty"") with the type of relationship between the technology supplier and recipient (the ""interorganizational interaction""). A quite detailed framework characterizing technology uncertainty along the dimensions of technology novelty, complexity, and tacitness is presented to help in assessing the challenges associated with transferring a particular product technology. This article also considers detailed elements characterizing the interorganizational interactions between the technology source and recipient firms. This helps firms consider the appropriate means to facilitate the inter firm process of technology transfer. Overall, this article provides practical insight into characterizing technologies and into improving the product technology transfer process. This article also provides a strong theoretical foundation to aid future research on product technology transfer in the technology supply chain.",10.1111/1540-5885.00042,Journal of Product Innovation Management,,:1542285905,Product technology transfer in the upstream supply chain,2003.0

Problem areas are identified together with various illustrations of good practice, with a particular stress on the necessity for intensive and effective informal communications. The particular problems attendant on the design side of the process, rooted in role confusion and a lack of design fixity are highlighted. This links to the suggestion that as the knowledge of Hybrid systems becomes better understood and is more fully communicated through codification then many of these problems should evaporate. That is, Hybrid can move from being a disruptive technology and become a sustaining technology for the industry and its clients.",10.1680/stbu.2003.156.2.193,Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers: Structures and Buildings,Concrete structures | Management | Research and development,:0141783819,Hybrid concrete: Improved processes and performance,2003.0
978,"The multi-agent system (MAS) raise the intelligence and adaptability of complex software systems, at the same time enables more sophisticated attacks on networks and IT systems. The right designing and well managed agent behaviors allows a high degree of security to be achieved. The MATRIX architecture offers a pragmatic and and scalable approach to resolve the security issue, that may be applied to other MAS. However, the system provides the specific degree of security for use on a network of trusted hosts.",10.1016/S1571-0661(04)80338-4,Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science,,18944374134,Top-secret multi-agent systems,2002.0
979,"The Guadalhorce catchment is characterized by hydrological extremes, severe flooding which has intermittently devastated the coastal conurbation of Málaga and riparian settlements upstream and periodic droughts of several years' duration. The region is also affected locally by high levels of salinity in soils and water. Attempts to manage this situation to permit economic development through agriculture and industry over several centuries seemed to have ameliorated the worst excesses and during the 20th century a series of major dam projects offered the potential for sustainable future economic growth. However, rapid population growth and shifting patterns of agriculture have brought the question of sustainability back on to the agenda. This paper analyses the hydrological characteristics of the severe drought of the mid-1990s, in terms of its impacts both on water quantity and water quality in the region. The strategies adopted to maintain domestic and tourist water supplies in the face of high demands from irrigation, particularly looking at the conjunctive use of groundwater, and the development of regional water grids are evaluated. The pressures on water quality, which developed in various parts of the Guadalhorce hydrological system, including in the main water supply network for the city, are also explored. The paper concludes that the demands on the water supply system are unlikely to be manageable through current strategies and that ecological and water quality issues will probably prove more critical than water volumes in determining approaches to management of future droughts.

980,"Warehousing is becoming more and more a critical activity in the supply chain to outperform competitors on customer service, lead times, and costs. However, if warehousing is to be a source of competitive advantage, then the implementation of a warehouse management information system (WMS) is a necessary condition to achieve efficiently the high performance of warehousing operations required in today's marketplace. A major practical question is then whether a given warehouse should implement a standard or a tailor-made WMS. A standard WMS offers many advantages; it is a proven solution, it is less costly, the implementation lead time is shorter, and the after-sales service is better. On the other hand, a standard WMS remains largely making compromises between the way a warehouse wants to work and the way the system allows the warehouse to work. In certain environments, such compromises might seriously degrade warehouse performance, in which case it then seems better to implement a tailor-made WMS. To answer the above question, we conducted an exploratory field study of warehouses with recently implemented WMSs to first understand the empirical reality and then build up a theory linking the constructs warehouse complexity and warehouse planning and control structure. Warehouse complexity refers to the number and variety of items to be handled, the degree of their interaction, and the number, nature, i.e. technologies used, and variety of processes, determined among others by the warehouse's position in the logistic chain and the nature of its market. Warehouse planning and control structure refers to the management functions that plan, direct, coordinate and control the flow of goods through the warehouse, from the time of receiving to the time of shipping. It is strongly related to the WMS in use. We found that the number of orderlines to be processed per day and the number of stock-keeping units are the two main observable aspects of warehouse complexity; that the more complex the warehouse is, the more tailor-made the planning and control structure should be; that for simple warehouses a standardized planning and control structure suffices; and that the design of a new-to-build warehouse should be carried out in close concert with the design of the warehouse planning and control structure. © MCB UP Limited.",10.1108/09600030210434161,International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management,Inventory control | Management information systems | Operations planning | Warehousing,11844305286,Linking warehouse complexity to warehouse planning and control structure: An exploratory study of the use of warehouse management information systems,2002.0
981,"Understanding industries in terms of the concepts of chains, clusters and networks is becoming increasingly important in economies around the world. Supply chain management for an individual organization is an emerging field of research in the construction management discipline, but less attention has been devoted to investigating the nature of the construction supply chains and their industrial organizational economic environment. This selected review of construction and mainstream management supply chain literature is organized around four themes; distribution, production, strategic procurement management and industrial organization economics, and highlights the need to develop an industrial organization economic supply chain framework for construction. The merging of the supply chain concept with the industrial organization model as a methodology for understanding firm conduct and industry structure and performance is an important contribution to both construction supply chain and construction economic theory. Much of the industrial organization supply chain literature has tended to focus upon manufacturing industries, where typically firms are permanent organizations. This raises issues as to the differences between industries founded upon temporary compared with permanent organizations. There is potential for the development of an industrial organization methodology applicable to the project based industry. Ultimately industrial organization research seeks to have direct implications for industry performance and government policies.",10.1080/01446190110081699,Construction Management and Economics,Construction industry | Critical review | Industrial organization economics | Supply chain theory,:0035576510,An industrial organization economic supply chain approach for the construction industry: A review,2001.0
982,"As global markets grow increasingly efficient, competition no longer takes place between individual businesses, but between entire value chains. Collaboration through intelligent e-business networks will provide the competitive edge that enables all the participants in a value chain to prevail and grow. Collaboration requires individual participants to adopt simplified, standardized solutions based on common architectures and data models. Time to market is critical, and participants will have to forego the luxuries of customization and modification that characterized the proprietary infrastructures of the past. © 2001, MCB UP Limited",10.1108/EUM0000000006039,Supply Chain Management: An International Journal,Business development | Internet | Supply-chain management,:0038197300,Collaboration: The key to value creation in supply chain management,2001.0
983,"The claim is made that many of today's evolutions in business management, characterized by new ways of knowledge creation in a collaborative, multi-disciplinary environment, are not yet adequately reflected in business college education. The paper puts business education within the framework of demand chain management and supply networks, which will dictate modern business management. Secondly, the management process is revisited in terms of dynamic performance measurement and the link with double-loop learning. Then the paper will go on discussing the multi-functionality required and how this is (not) reflected in many business curricula. Finally, the author addresses the need to expose business students to modern business ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), and collaborative commerce-software interfaces, in conjunction with a critical analysis of the underlying methodologies used. Furthermore, the need to collaborate more closely within the business school setting and outside with business practitioners is highlighted. © 2001, MCB UP Limited",10.1108/09696470110391202,The Learning Organization,Business education | Collaboration | Management learning | Performance measures | Supply chain,84986160642,Learning in the new business school setting: A collaborative model,2001.0
984,"Current electronic markets require highly flexible and dynamic computer systems. For example, a supply chain management system, which creates added value by combining and utilizing various types of information in a network, covers both the Internet and intranets. This makes it difficult for systems to work efficiently if they are designed statically and inflexibly. Moreover, since new business models are continually being developed, quick reconfiguration and dynamic modification are critical in designing the systems. This paper proposes a way of creating such systems by integrating agent migration, distributed objects, and multi-threading. These are implemented in a network programming language called Mobidget.",,NEC Research and Development,Distributed object | Heterogeneous environment | Mobile agent | Multi-thread | Network,:0035068841,Mobidget: A platform for mobile and distributed systems adaptive to Internet/intranet,2001.0
