The bio-fuel is derived from biomass that is obtained from agricultural products such as plant debris. In addition, the supply chain is affected by risks which are due to several reasons such as economic, natural phenomena, political and etc. The occurrence of such events can cause disruption in supply chain which can significantly increase the total supply chain costs and also prevent serve to customers. Reliability is involved the capability of a network to achieve an anticipated process such as communication. Analysis of network reliability has acknowledged significant consideration and is consequently broadly studied to forecast and avoid any network failure. In order to distribute bio-fuel to the customers, designing a reliable and sustainable bio-fuel supply chain is very importance. Thus a growth in bio-fuel production demonstrates the requirement for establishing an effective and reliable network of chain that not only accomplishes sound under regular circumstances nevertheless restricted risk under various unanticipated disruption situations. This paper presents mathematical model to design an efficient bio-fuel supply chain network at pre-disaster stage that considering failure in the connecting links between the facilities. In which the probability of failure of the links is forecasted by a spatial statistic approach and also due to the fact that disasters can cause disruptions in bio-refineries, leads to use the risk-pooling effect in order to reduce total costs. In order to solve the proposed mathematical model, two meta-heuristic algorithms containing genetic algorithm (GA) and bat algorithm (BA) are utilized. The results show that by increasing the reliability and improvement of connecting links between facilities and considering the risk-pooling effect on disrupted bio-refineries, the total costs of supply chain can be considerably reduced.

The ANP helps in analyzing the interdependence and interrelations among the various determinants and dimensions of GSCM strategy selection. Fuzzy set theory is applied to avoid the vagueness and uncertainty in human preference judgement. This study uses an empirical case study of an Indian automobile organization to validate the applicability of the proposed model. The results show that the resource based strategy is in first position, having the maximum impact on each determinant. The case organization should improve the green management system with the assistance of a suitable GSCM strategy, i.e. the resource based strategy. This study may help managers to make decisions, and to analyze and standardize their environmental advantages dynamically. The robustness of the projected model is checked by conducting a sensitivity analysis.

A major issue regarding biomass resources is crop residues or leftover biomass that is burnt by farmers after harvesting; this happens due to high transportation costs which make burning the cheapest way to remove the residue. We develop a decision support system using a large-scale linear program with the goal of maximizing profit with and without the emission cost. This system helps identify farms that would benefit society were they to be incentivized under a biomass crop assistance program (BCAP). A case study of leftover corn stover in the state of North Dakota is analyzed to validate the model. Our results reveal that an incentive of $7.20 per ton of corn stover converted to ethanol when 20% of rail capacity is allocated is ideal, as it produces the lowest emissions of 16,784,953 metric tons with a $73,462,599 profit. Furthermore, penalizing emissions resulting from the transportation of corn stover also helps reduce emissions; a suitable value for the penalty could be $71.7 per metric ton of CO2 emitted. Such a policy would result in reducing dependency on petroleum, thus promoting a sustainable biomass supply chain.","[Ghani, N.

In many industries, only companies that manage to be competitive globally can aspire to attain sustainable competitive advantages. Therefore, offshore outsourcing has become essential for many companies and recently has become more and more a vital part of the long-term strategies of the leading firms. The rapidly shifting conditions in the marketplace is forcing management to constantly review and defend its core competencies. Management is now confronted with a higher level of complexity and disruptions brought about in particular by the new waves of globalization and the irresistible march of technological changes. For these reasons, offshore outsourcing is transforming the functions of the traditional firms into a network of competencies. The tendency to offshore most of the productive and economic activities and processes can lead companies to transform themselves into virtual organizations, where all the functions could be outsourced through the formation of flexible networks and agile organizational structures.","[Pellicelli, Michela] Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, I-27100 Pavia, Italy","Pellicelli, M (corresponding author), Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",michela.pellicelli@unipv.it,,,,,,79,0,0,2,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2018,10,5,,,,,,,1672,10.3390/su10051672,,,12,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ7RP,WOS:000435587100368,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

The most obvious practical examples of the problem are territorial designing and locating of academies, airline networks, and medical service centers. In order to assure network reliability versus uncertainty, an efficient robust optimization approach is applied to model the proposed problem. The formulation is minimizing the total expected costs, including transshipment costs, Facility Location (FL) costs, and fixed cost of road/link utilization as well as minimizing the total penalties of uncovered demand nodes. Then, in order to consider several system uncertainties, the proposed model is changed to a fuzzy robust model by suitable approaches. An efficient sub-gradient based Lagrangian relaxation algorithm is applied. In addition, a practical example is studied. In the following, a series of experiments, including several test problems, is designed and solved to evaluate of the performance of the algorithm. The obtained results emphasize that considering practical factors (e.g. several uncertainties, system disruptions, and customer satisfaction) in modelling of the problem can lead to significant improvement of the system yield and, subsequently, more efficient utilization of the established network.

This paper reflects on (1) CRFS merits compared to other approaches; (2) the operational potential of applying the CRFS approach to existing projects through case analysis; (3) how to make the CRFS approach more robust and ways to further operationalize the approach; and (4) the potential for the CRFS approach to address complex challenges including integrated governance, territorial development, metabolic flows, and climate change. The paper begins with the rationale for CRFS as both a conceptual framework and an integrative operational approach, as it helps to build increasingly coherent transformational food systems. CRFS is differentiated from existing approaches to understand the context and gaps in theory and practice. We then explore the strength of CRFS through the conceptual building blocks of 'food systems' and 'city-regions' as appropriate, or not, to address pressing complex challenges. As both a multi-stakeholder, sustainability-building approach and process, CRFS provides a collective voice for food actors across scales and could provide coherence across jurisdictions, policies, and scales, including the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact, the Sustainable Development Goals, the Habitat III New Urban Agenda, and the Conference of the Parties (COP) 21. CRFS responds directly to calls in the literature to provide a conceptual and practical framing for policy through wide engagement across sectors that enables the co-construction of a relevant policy frame that can be enacted through sufficiently integrated policies and programs that achieve increasingly sustainable food systems.","[Blay-Palmer, Alison] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada; [Santini, Guido; Taguchi, Makiko; Giordano, Thierry] United Nat Food & Agr Org, I-00153 Rome, Italy; [Dubbeling, Marielle] RUAF Fdn, NL-3830 AK Leusden, Netherlands; [Renting, Henk] AERES Univ Appl Sci, Urban Food Syst, Stadhuisstr 18, NL-1315 HC Almere, Netherlands","Blay-Palmer, A (corresponding author), Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.",ablaypalmer@wlu.ca; Guido.Santini@fao.org; m.dubbeling@ruaf.org; h.renting@aeres.nl; Makiko.Taguchi@fao.org; Thierry.Giordano@fao.org,,"Taguchi, Makiko/0000-0002-2945-1249; Renting, Henk/0000-0002-6778-9507",Daniel and Nina Carasso Foundation; German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture; Wilfrid Laurier University; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of CanadaSocial Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC),"The authors are grateful from support from the Daniel and Nina Carasso Foundation, the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Wilfrid Laurier University and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.",,80,31,32,1,83,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2018,10,5,,,,,,,1680,10.3390/su10051680,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ7RP,WOS:000435587100376,,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2021-03-04

This article examines the role of global financial networks in articulating the nexus and in connecting it to sustainability programs. It provides new insights into critical engagements with the nexus that, to date, have focused predominantly on water security and governance. The article examines how global financial networks conceptualized and concretized the nexus towards two ends: First, the nexus was used to effect the transition from state-oriented development models to financialized approaches of water development and sustainability. Here, the nexus was formulated in critique of, and as a solution to, the previously dominant approach to water development: integrated water resources management (IWRM). Second, the nexus was deployed to connect water, energy, food, and climate to the global economy in terms of complex systems. The identification of risks to the resilience of environmental and economic systems provided a new form of integration across the supply chains affected by the governance and security of water, energy, food, and climate. In both cases, the nexus mobilizes technologies of global finance, such as credit-risk ratings, to construct and defend new strategies for governing water security and to enable sub-sovereign actors, such as municipalities, to be incorporated into the global economy. The paper concludes that alignments of the nexus with sustainability programs, and the Sustainable Development Goals, must be reconsidered in view of the constraints posed by financial orientations towards the risks and resilience of economic and environmental systems.","[Schmidt, Jeremy J.] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, South Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Matthews, Nathanial] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London WC2R 2LS, England","Schmidt, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Dept Geog, South Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",jeremy.schmidt@durham.ac.uk; nathanial.matthews@kcl.ac.uk,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of CanadaSocial Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC),"The authors thank Harriet Bulkeley, Kathryn Furlong, Sohini Kar, Pablo Mendez, and the anonymous reviewers for thoughtful comments on previous iterations of the paper.

This paper proposes a multiobjective optimization model for a 4-layer biofuel supply chain network using mixed integer nonlinear programming while considering the benefits from economic, environmental, and societal aspects. The model can be used either to optimize an existing biofuel supply chain network or to guide the construction of a new biofuel supply chain network. The profit, the greenhouse gas emissions in transportation, and the market share of biofuel were set as targets for optimization. The selection of the participators at each layer, and the amount of the material flow between each pair of selected supplier and customer located at two adjacent layers were modeled as decision variables. The conventional weighted aggregation method was used to unify 3 objectives after normalization. Particle swarm optimization was used to solve this high-dimension multiobjective problem to obtain a near optimal solution. A numerical case study based on the state of Missouri in the United States was implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results of the case study illustrate that the benefits in terms of transportation emission, profit, and market share can be achieved simultaneously. Using the equal weights configuration in conventional weighted aggregation as an example, a 21% reduction of the transportation emission, a 33% increase of the profit, and a 2% augmentation of the market share were achieved compared to the benchmark scenario.","[Kesharwani, Rajkamal; Sun, Zeyi; Dagli, Cihan] Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Engn Management & Syst Engn, Rolla, MO 65409 USA","Sun, ZY (corresponding author), Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Engn Management & Syst Engn, Rolla, MO 65409 USA.",sunze@mst.edu,,"sun, zeyi/0000-0003-0704-2708",,,,58,10,10,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0363-907X,1099-114X,,INT J ENERG RES,Int.

The new-entrant supply chain competes against an existing one in a non-cooperative behavior. The networks include raw material suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, and the same demand markets. The manufacturers produce multiple products with deterministic, price-dependent demand. The goal is to maximize the future revenue of both chains. The problem is modeled by mathematical programming and the governing Nash equilibrium conditions are derived. Then, a finite-dimensional variational inequality formulation is presented to solve the equilibrium problem. Qualitative properties of the equilibrium pattern are provided to establish existence and uniqueness results under reasonable conditions.

Our analysis highlights the flexibility resulting from a decentralised software management architecture, thus enabling the dynamic reconfiguration of a SC network. In addition, the developed pilot simulation tool can assist operations managers in capturing the operational needs of facilities and assessing the performance of IAV systems while considering sustainability parameters.

In this paper, a Stackelberg gaming model for a three level food supply chain (consists of one retailer, one vendor and one supplier) with production disruption is established, which aims to study the optimal pricing, inventory and preservation decisions that maximize the individual profit. In the decentralized supply chain, upstream firms act as leaders and downstream firms as followers. Due to the mathematical complexity, an illustrative algorithm is developed to solve the problem. Numerical tests show that retailer's preservation investment not only benefits itself, but also benefits the vendor and the supplier. Comparing the optimal decisions to that in the 'forward integration' and 'backward integration' model, supply chain members' vertical cooperation helps to enhance the total profit. Meanwhile, the carbon footprint of the food supply chain is also studied. It is found that, vertical cooperation contributes to the reduction of carbon emission. In most situations, 'forward integration' outperforms 'backward integration' strategy because it incents the retailer to invest more in preservation and reduce food deterioration. Other managerial implications are also shown in the paper. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Concentrating on the problems of the product and network design for a multi-product, multi-echelon and multi-period CLSC, in this work a two-stage stochastic mixed integer linear model incorporating uncertainty on the quality and quantity of the return flows is proposed. In addition, risk management related to critical uncertain parameters is performed, where a conditional value at risk (CVaR) concept is applied to supply chain profits. The formulation considers decisions associated with the network design and, simultaneously, with the products to manufacture (new and remanufactured) and their associated raw materials (new and recovered). A network superstructure is considered accounting for two types of customers (first and second markets), raw material suppliers, factories, distribution centers, customer demands, recovery centers, recycle centers, final disposal locations and re-distribution centers. Optimal solutions with high economic and environmental benefits are obtained where the advantages of using the proposed approach are shown.

Existing decision support systems either require data that are unavailable in most developing countries or have objectives irrelevant in the context of developing countries. This paper therefore develops a decision support system that integrates transportation, pseudo p-median, forecasting and goal programming models to optimally design networks of grain storage facilities to reduce the transportation cost of respective stakeholders. The effectiveness of the proposed decision support system has been demonstrated by comparing phantom networks developed with the decision support system to the Government of Ghana's network of 48 grain storage facilities.","[Essien, E.] Univ Ghana, Legon, Ghana; [Dzisi, K.

The newest and most effective environmental and social life cycle assessment-based methods are applied to the proposed model to measure the relevant environmental and social impacts. To deal with uncertain parameters effectively, a novel multi-objective robust possibilistic programming approach is developed which is able to maximize the mean value of supply chain performance and control the optimality as well as feasibility robustness. Computational analysis is also provided by using a real case study in Iran to show the performance and validity of the proposed model. The results show that with an increase of 2.43% in the economic objective function, a desirable level of environmental and social protection is achieved. Additionally, the mean value of supply chain performance will enjoy more desirable values if the influence of optimality robustness and feasibility robustness decreases. The results also demonstrate that the proposed robust model outperforms the deterministic model in terms of the average and standard deviation measures. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Hence, there is a need to manifest resiliency in order to withstand the inevitable change without affecting its robustness and stability. The three aspects of a resilient BPS are interconnectivity, adaptability and transformability. The interconnectivity concept deals with the reliability and effectiveness of the supply chain network and production systems' resourcefulness. The adaptability aspect reinforces the agility and adjusting capacity of a system towards versatility and flexibility across the range of elements involved in the production system. Transformability deals with the capacity of a system to alter into a new system based on research, innovation and creativity. Therefore, the core aspects of resiliency in a BPS would result in increased stability and effectiveness. System dynamics models have been developed depicting the cause and effect of each of the three aspects. Finally, a model has been presented which could enable researchers and organizations to take guided decision towards a more robust and resilient BPS. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

For INGOs, transformational change is defined as a fundamental, long-lasting reframing of a social or industrial system through synergistically altering the knowledge, practices, and relationships of multiple stakeholder groups. With each intervention, the focal INGO assembles its own complex supply chain of nonprofit organizations and for-profit firms to provide the necessary resources and skills. While prior supply chain management literature provides a good starting point, with some generalizability to the nonprofit sector, this study begins with several key differences to explore how interventions are delivered, and then, how INGOs' supply chains must be aligned. In doing so, at least three critical factors must be taken into account to improve alignment: stakeholder-induced uncertainty; supply chain configuration; and supply chain dynamism. By synthesizing these factors with prior literature and emerging anecdotal evidence, tentative frameworks and research questions emerge about how INGOs can better leverage their supply chains, thereby offering a basis for scholars in supply chain management to build a much richer and more nuanced research understanding of INGOs.","[Gualandris, Jury; Klassen, Robert D.] Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON, Canada","Gualandris, J (corresponding author), Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON, Canada.",,"Klassen, Robert D/I-2178-2012","Gualandris, Jury/0000-0003-4866-7050; Klassen, Robert/0000-0002-8650-137X",,,,72,10,10,3,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1523-2409,1745-493X,,J SUPPLY CHAIN MANAG,J.

One of the strategic purposes of managers is to supply the sustainable agricultural products and food in stable conditions which require the production of soil nutrients. In this regard, some disruptions such as sanctions and natural disasters have a destructive effect on the supply of raw materials and the uncertainty of input parameters plays an undesirable impact on the decision-making levels including strategic, tactical, and operational levels. The present study introduced a new model of resilient supply chain network which was compatible with the realities of the structure of the supply chain for fertilizer in Iran. Notably, the effectiveness of the designed system was promoted by the dominant strategies of reliability. Further, a new robust possibilistic approach was proposed which guaranteed the optimality and feasibility robustness through the efficient solution to deal with the parametric uncertainty. Finally, the results showed that the proposed new robust possibilistic combination promoted the optimality robustness and its effectiveness using an optimal average cost and minimum standard deviation.","[Hamidieh, A.; Khamseh, A.

Assessing different agricultural development pathways,JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EASTERN-EUROPE; EFFICIENCY; SYSTEM; FARMS; CAP; PRODUCTIVITY; ENVIRONMENT; COUNTRIES; IMPACT; POLICY,"For decades agricultural development has been led by a modernisation paradigm based on specialisation, intensification and scale enlargement. This model of development model has been supported by means of price support policies and, often, strong central marketing agencies, which had a stabilising effect on prices and significantly reduced market risks for an array of commodities. The economic rationale of this model is based on the pursuit of economies of scale and highly efficient technical production. This model has led farmers to increasing their technical capacity and to neglect activities such as marketing, which was delegated to specialised marketing agencies. In this paper we argue that such specialisation has weakened the economic resilience of farms. Although a high level of specialisation allows farmers to be technically efficient, acquire highly specific production skills and apply the latest production techniques, it also leads specialised farms to be highly dependent on the commodity market(s) in which they operate, increasing their economic vulnerability. As markets have become deregulated, prices of both inputs and produce have become more volatile, often compromising the economic sustainability of these specialised farms. The weakened economic resilience of such farms has been aggravated by the gradual dismantling of producer price support causing an increase in price volatility, which has become a near-universal phenomenon for almost all agricultural produce. Highly specialised farming is now only viable where markets are stable and this requires the existence of effective market agencies and strong inter-branch organisations and/or the prevalence of contract farming. The increasing market orientation of the CAP, the fragmentation and weakening of marketing agencies and last but not least the growing societal demand for a more sustainable agriculture have led many farmers to rethink their farm development strategies. They are rediscovering farm diversification as one way of reducing market risks, as well improving the efficiency of the farm's organisation and resource use. Economies of scope emerge when a farmer can use the same input(s) to produce two or more products, and lower the cost of producing them separately. To achieve this end the inputs have to be complementary. By developing cost complementarities between different crops or livestock species, diversified farms can become more efficient than specialised farms. Another way that diversified farms can increase their economic sustainability is to partially produce for niche markets thereby generating a higher added value. A product mix of high quality products, possibly from the same production sector, but aimed at different, specific, market segments can further contribute to increasing the overall profitability of diversified farms. This paper summarises a series of case studies from EU member states and Israel which illustrate how farmers are experimenting with alternative pathways of development based on diversification. It is also shows the challenges they face. These include learning the skills for marketing high value-added farm products, establishing short food chains and the rebuilding supportive social and economic networks. The latter is particularly important when farms are too small to diversify effectively individually. Farms that participate in these economic networks are more able to internalise external economies generated within these networks and develop their knowledge of marketing and production through close cooperation with other farms. In some of the case studies the success of diversification clearly depended on the ability of farms to collaborate and share knowledge especially when new technical capacities for say, introducing crop diversification or intercropping, needed to be acquired. The knowledge involved in developing new crop rotation patterns, knowing about crop associations and combinations of crop and livestock activities was either developed ex novo or by rediscovering traditional knowledge. At the same time training in marketing food products is also a key to successfully shifting from being a specialised farm to a diversified one. Farmers need encouragement in order to work together and share their knowledge and experiences of diversification strategies. To this end policies that support collaborative networks are needed. Policies are also required to help establish and sustain collective marketing initiatives, especially short and direct supply chains. Finally, public support to assure against market risks is very helpful when farmers are entering into new markets. These policies are essential to support the existing processes of change that are occurring at grassroots level which are leading to a new model of farm modernisation. The specific contribution that this paper makes to the rural social science literature is to empirically highlight the limitations of theories about the benefits of economies of scale.

This study proposes a robust integrated reverse logistics supply chain planning model with a modular product design at different quality levels. A mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is formulated to maximise the profit by considering the collection of returned products, the recovery of modules and the proportion of the product mix at different quality levels. This paper proposes the collection of returnable items (end-of-life, defective and under-warranty products) through retail outlets and the appropriate recovery of modules to manage these using a network of recovery service providers. The modular product design approach is adopted to create design criteria that provide an improved recovery process at a lower cost. This robust model seeks solutions close to the mathematically optimal solutions for a set of alternative scenarios identified by a decision-maker. The efficacy of the proposed model is evaluated by a given set of variously sized numerical expressions and sensitivity analyses. A robust solution is found that appraises the impact of two major sources of uncertainty, demand rate and the volume of returned products of a key recycled material.","[Shahparvari, Shahrooz; Chhetri, Prem; Chan, Caroline] RMIT Univ, Coll Business, Sch Business IT & Logist, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Asefi, Hossein] Univ New South Wales, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Shahparvari, S (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Coll Business, Sch Business IT & Logist, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",shahrooz.shahparvari@rmit.edu.au,,"Shahparvari, Shahrooz/0000-0003-4815-3041; Chan, Caroline/0000-0002-7422-2488",,,,129,4,5,0,42,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0268-3768,1433-3015,,INT J ADV MANUF TECH,Int.

To propel this fledgling industry further towards commercialization, the efficient and effective design of its supply chain is of paramount importance. In this regard, this study proposes a hybrid robust-scenario based optimization model to design a resilient photovoltaic supply chain under both business-as-usual and hazard uncertainties. To capture business-as-usual uncertainty, a customized robust optimization method is developed, which is capable of tackling correlated uncertain parameters and adjusting the level of conservatism in the solutions. Likewise, a number of proactive and reactive resilience strategies are incorporated into the model to ameliorate the resilience level of the concerned supply chain in the presence of hazard uncertainty. The capabilities of the developed model are explored by discussing a real case study via which helpful managerial insights are gained. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The spatial variabilities in soil type, topography, climate, and crop management practices further require vast computational time and resources to estimate the availability of sustainable biomass for a large study area. In this study, we developed a GIS-based integrated predictive modeling platform to assess the availability of sustainable crop residues at high spatial (30 m) and temporal (2010-2022) scales. A GIS-based multi-criteria inclusion-exclusion analysis and facility location-allocation models were used to identify suitable sites, and optimal siting of biogas plants respectively with biomass delivered cost. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based predictive models were well suited to predict sustainability indicators (soil erosion SE- R-2 = 0.96, soil conditioning index, SCI- R-2 = 0.98 and organic matter factor, OMF- R-2 = 0.83) for assessing sustainable removal rates of crop residues (corn stover and wheat straw). The GIS-based integrated model was applied to the State of Ohio and found that about 4-13 dry Tg of crop residues can be sustainably available to build 1-25 regional biogas plants. A typical optimal biogas plant with a feedstock capacity of up to 500 dry Gg could be drawn from a transport radius of about 19-35 km with a delivered cost of 40-46 $ dry Mg-1. The temporal and spatial variations in assessing the availability of biomass largely affected the supply chain decisions and its delivered costs.","[Sahoo, Kamalakanta; Mani, Sudhagar] Univ Georgia, Sch Chem Mat & Biomed Engn, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Das, Lalitendu] Univ Kentucky, Dept Biosyst & Agr Engn, Lexington, KY 40546 USA; [Bettinger, Pete] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Mani, S (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Sch Chem Mat & Biomed Engn, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",smani@engr.uga.edu,"Mani, Sudhagar/A-4315-2010; Bettinger, Pete/H-2189-2018; Sahoo, Kamalakanta/Q-2187-2019; Sahoo, Kamalakanta/O-4511-2018","Mani, Sudhagar/0000-0003-1920-8381; Bettinger, Pete/0000-0002-5454-3970; Sahoo, Kamalakanta/0000-0002-7763-5296; ",USDA - NIFA Biomass Research and Development Initiative (BRDI) [2012-1008-2032],This project was supported by the USDA - NIFA Biomass Research and Development Initiative (BRDI) grant (Grant #2012-1008-2032).,,45,22,23,2,46,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0961-9534,1873-2909,,BIOMASS BIOENERG,Biomass Bioenerg.,MAR,2018,110,,,,,,63,74,,10.1016/j.biombioe.2018.01.006,,,12,Agricultural Engineering; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Energy & Fuels,Agriculture; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Energy & Fuels,FX2CZ,WOS:000425867500008,,,,,2021-03-04

Since the market concentration of raw material suppliers is a determinant of the supply disruption risk, identification of raw materials vital in a supply chain and concurrently whose markets are highly concentrated will help supply chain risk management. In this study, we develop a graph theory-based methodology for assessing supply chain vulnerability to disruption risks by using the life cycle inventory (LCI) database as a data source for nationwide supply chains. A supply chain structure, i.e., raw material-to-product links and overall chain, is modeled by a directed graph and its adjacency matrix, adapted from physical input-output data in the LCI database. The reachability components in the supply chain are identified by Boolean matrix calculations. Vulnerability indicators for each reachability component are determined on the basis of market concentration as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index in terms of domestic production regions and import partners as a proxy for the extent of supply disruption risks. The methodology developed is demonstrated using the national-level LCI database of Japan, and vulnerability factors are presented for 23 types of Japanese synthetic resins. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In some cases, the disastrous effects may affect larger, even cross-border areas At European level, there are continuous efforts to develop land-use planning policies and regulations to reduce consequences and to prevent future accidents from happening. Hence, research in this field comes to support the current actions and strategies of the European Commission to improve the capacity of the EU Member States to cope with and respond to the identified risks through effective prevention, preparedness and response measures. In Romania, the Seveso establishments are mostly located in or very close to urban areas. This paper analyses vulnerability in case of two different accident scenarios (explosion and toxic dispersion) in Targu-Mures, a city hosting one of the largest Seveso upper-tier establishments in Romania. The approach starts with exposure analysis - the first step in the process of vulnerability analysis - which identifies all the elements at risk, be they social (population, medical facilities, schools), environmental (protected areas, water bodies) or economic (transport infrastructure, buildings, utility and water supply networks, fuel or food storage facilities). Following the exposure analysis, vulnerability is assessed based on indicators selected in such way so that they cover the entire range of social, economic, environmental aspects, as well as the existing response capabilities in case of a major accident.","[Stefanescu, Lucrina; Botezan, Camelia; Craciun, Iulia] Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Environm Sci & Engn, Res Inst Sustainabil & Disaster Management, High Performance Comp ISUMADECIP, 30 Fantanele, Cluj Napoca, Romania","Botezan, C (corresponding author), Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Environm Sci & Engn, Res Inst Sustainabil & Disaster Management, High Performance Comp ISUMADECIP, 30 Fantanele, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",camelia.costan@ubbcluj.ro,"Stefanescu, Lucrina/AAU-4449-2020; Stefanescu, Lucrina/AAC-4705-2019","Stefanescu, Lucrina/0000-0002-7431-2117; Botezan, Camelia/0000-0002-2187-3893","European Social Fund, Administrative Capacity Operational Programme (POCA) SIPOCA grant, Disaster Risk Assessment at national level - RoRISK [30]","This paper was supported by the European Social Fund, Administrative Capacity Operational Programme (POCA) SIPOCA grant 30, Disaster Risk Assessment at national level - RoRISK.",,22,3,3,0,1,CLUJ UNIV PRESS,CLUJ NAPOCA,"STRADA B P HASDEU NR 51, CLUJ NAPOCA, 400371, ROMANIA",1842-5135,2065-4421,,GEOGR TECH,Geogr.

Addressing this concept inevitably requires a multi-objective analysis to evaluate the social and environmental impacts in addition to the usual economic performance objective. Furthermore, the final sustainability of the proposed solutions very often depends on uncertain conditions, especially in the very frequent case that renewable resources are considered in order to enhance environmental sustainability: these resources are usually affected by unpredictable variations in their quality/quantity availability. But the approaches presented for solving multi-objective problems under uncertainty are limited by the amount of scenarios required to represent the unknown conditions. Here it is presented a solution strategy that combines a scenario reduction algorithm within the framework of a multi-objective formulation. Such a strategy is able to produce a fast and robust multi-objective optimization (MOO) while considering uncertainty in the raw material conditions (more precisely quality and availability). The solutions forming the resulting set of Pareto solutions are sorted hierarchically using the Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality IV (ELECTRE IV) method, which identifies the ones showing better overall performance considering the uncertain parameters space.

In order to test the proposed proposed, model an exploratory case study with a leading pharmaceutical company was conducted. The proposed maturity model presents an evaluation tool that allows systematic assessment and visualisation of organisational routines and practices relevant to sustainable manufacturing in the context of water scarcity.

Nitrogen balance provides farmers with a means of demonstrating to an increasingly concerned public that they are succeeding in reducing nitrogen losses while also improving the overall sustainability of their farming operation. Likewise, supply-chain companies and policymakers can use nitrogen balance to track progress toward sustainability goals.

This problem is formulated as a multi objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming model to maximize the lowest victims' perceived satisfaction, and minimize respectively the largest deviation on victims' perceived satisfaction for all demand points and sub-phases. Then, genetic algorithm is proposed to solve this mathematical model. To validate the proposed methodologies, a case study from Wenchuan earthquake is illustrated. Computational results demonstrate genetic algorithm here can achieve the trade-off between solution quality and computation time for relief distribution with the concern of sustainability. Furthermore, it indicates that the methodology provides the tools for decision-makers to optimize the structure of relief distribution network and inventory, as well as alleviate the suffering of victims.

Attack graph analysis and risk assessment provide information that can be used to protect the assets of a network from cyber-attacks. Furthermore, attack graphs provide functionality that can be used to identify vulnerabilities in a network and how these can be exploited by potential attackers. Existing attack graph generation methods are inadequate in satisfying certain requirements necessary in a dynamic supply chain risk management environment, since they do not consider variables that assist in exploring specific network parts that satisfy certain criteria, such as the entry and target points, the propagation length and the location and capability of the potential attacker. In this paper, we present a cyber-attack path discovery method that is used as a component of a maritime risk management system. The method uses constraints and Depth-first search to effectively generate attack graphs that the administrator is interested in. To support our method and to show its effectiveness we have evaluated it using real data from a maritime supply chain. (c) 2017 The Authors.

They operate in cooperative, but competitive, co-opetitive, environments wherein individual port throughput is linked through an underlying transshipment network. Short-term port performance and long-term market share can be significantly impacted by a disaster event; thus, ports plan to invest in capacity expansion and protective measures to increase their reliability or resiliency in times of disruption. To account for the co-opetition among ports, a bi-level multiplayer game theoretic approach is used, wherein each individual port takes protective investment decisions while anticipating the response of the common market-clearing shipping assignment problem in the impacted network. This lower-level assignment is modeled as a cost minimization problem, which allows for consideration of gains and losses from other ports decisions through changes in port and service capacities and port cargo handling times. Linear properties of the lower-level formulation permit reformulation of the individual port bilevel optimization problems as single-level problems by replacing the common lower-level by its equivalent Karush Kuhn Tucker (KKT) conditions. Simultaneous consideration of individual port optimization problems creates a multi-leader, common-follower problem, i.e. an unrestricted game, that is modeled as an Equilibrium Problem with Equilibrium Constraints (EPEC). Equilibria solutions are sought by use of a diagonalization technique. Solutions of unrestricted, semi-restricted and restricted games are analyzed and compared for a hypothetical application from the literature involving ports in East Asia and Europe. The proposed co-opetitive approach was found to lead to increased served total demand, significantly increased market share for many ports and improved services for shippers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A comprehensive classification, including sources of uncertainty, corresponding parameters and possible reasons which may cause the uncertainty, as well as an up to date and systematic literature review of biofuel supply chain optimal design and planning studies which consider uncertain input data are presented. To handle different types of uncertainty, including randomness, epistemic and deep uncertainties, a hybrid robust optimization model is proposed. Uncertainty in technology is presented as imprecise conversion rates, which are expressed as probabilistic scenarios. Biomass yield is treated as fuzzy numbers while demand is assumed to vary in a known interval. Furthermore, fixed costs of the biorefineries are calculated according to the piecewise linear functions in which segments are capacity level intervals. In order to investigate the performance of the proposed models a case study is developed for bioethanol supply chain located in Iran. Computational results show that the proposed robust model outperforms deterministic model in terms of given performance measures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This research develops models for closed-loop pallet pooling providers to understand the environmental and economic impact of customer characteristics and design options. First, an analytical model is developed to quantify the effects of repair facility location and pallet service conditions on a pallet pooling system's economic and environmental performance. Next, a simulation model is developed to investigate two common operational policies, crossdocking and take-back, and to quantify the impact of pallet handling and loading conditions and customer network structures on several key performance indicators. Results indicate that pallet handling and loading conditions are the most important factors determining the cost and carbon equivalent emission of a pallet pooling operation. Better pallet handling and appropriate loading increase the percentage of pallets that can be repositioned with little or no repair. This increases the radius within which a closed-loop pallet pooling system is feasible. Under random handling/loading conditions and distances, a crossdocking approach satisfies demand with 28% fewer pallets than a take-back policy. This is due to a quicker reissue time under a crossdocking approach. However, associated costs and emissions of the two policies are nearly identical due to the increased transportation costs associated with crossdocking. The models and insights proposed in this work can help support decision making by pallet pooling providers to determine operational regions and customer selection, among other network design trade-offs.

In practice, in addition to uncertainty or noise parameters, a comprehensive optimization model must be able to attend other circumstances which might be imposed in problems under real operational conditions such as dynamic objectives, multi-responses, various probabilistic distribution, discrete and continuous data, physical constraints to design parameters, performance cost, computational complexity and multi-process environment. The main goal of this paper is to give a general overview on topics with brief systematic review and concise discussions about the recent development on comprehensive robust design optimization methods under hybrid aforesaid circumstances. Both optimization methods of mathematical programming based on Taguchi approach and robust optimization based on scenario sets are briefly described. Metamodels hybrid robust design is discussed as an appropriate methodology to decrease computational complexity in problems under uncertainty. In this context, the authors' policy is to choose important topics for giving a systematic picture to those who wish to be more familiar with recent studies about robust design optimization hybrid metamodels, also by attending real circumstances in practice. In particular, production and project management are considered as two important methodologies that could be improved by applications of advanced robust design combining with metamodel methods.

This framework can explore the vulnerability of power supply network under two types of events: random type and intentional type. It also integrates a new metric that calculates the vulnerability of power supply network in both structural dimension and functional dimension. Taking the power supply network of a city in east China as an example, network vulnerability under different types of events was assessed, and the dose-response interrelationships between network performance and event scale under different types of events were thoroughly discussed. The results demonstrated that power supply network was more vulnerable to intentional events in both dimensions. For intentional events, power supply network was more vulnerable to degree-based attack than to betweenness-based attack. After that, the redundancy coefficient of power supply network was optimized. The conclusion and some suggestions for future research were given in the end.","[Tang, Haizhou; Zhao, Xudong; Chen, Zhilong; Su, Xiaochao] Army Engn Univ PLA, State Key Lab Explos & Impact & Disaster Prevent, Nanjing 210007, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jiheng] Army Engn Univ PLA, Teaching & Res Ctr Civil Air Def, Nanjing 210007, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Zhao, XD (corresponding author), Army Engn Univ PLA, State Key Lab Explos & Impact & Disaster Prevent, Nanjing 210007, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",wxlmss@163.com,,"Zhao, Xudong/0000-0001-6667-4946","City Construction Bureau and Municipal Design and Research Institute of Lianyungang City, China; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51708554]","The authors appreciate the data and information supports from the City Construction Bureau and Municipal Design and Research Institute of Lianyungang City, China.

A novel approach is explored for designing the e-recycling reverse logistics network (RLN) under uncertainty. The goal is to obtain a solution, i.e., increasing the storage capacity of the logistics node, to achieve optimal or near-optimal profit under the collection requirement set by the government and the investment from the enterprise. The approach comprises two parts: a matrix-based simulation model of RLN formed for the uncertainty of demand and reverse logistics collection which calculates the profit under a given candidate solution and simulated annealing (SA) algorithm that is tailored to generating solution using the output of RLN model. To increase the efficiency of the SA algorithm, network static analysis is proposed for getting the quantitative importance of each node in RLN, including the static network generation process and index design. Accordingly, the quantitative importance is applied to increase the likelihood of generating a better candidate solution in the neighborhood search of SA. Numerical experimentation is conducted to validate the RLN model as well as the efficiency of the improved SA.","[Wang, Lei; Ding, Ronggui] Shandong Univ, Sch Management, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lei; Goh, Mark; Mishra, Vikas Kumar] Natl Univ Singapore, Logist Inst Asia Pacific, Heng Mui Keng Terrace, Singapore 119613, Singapore; [Goh, Mark] Natl Univ Singapore, NUS Business Sch, Kent Ridge Dr, Singapore 119245, Singapore","Ding, RG (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Sch Management, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China.",drgsdupm@gmail.com,"goh, mark/G-1689-2010","goh, mark/0000-0002-3620-7658",A*Star grantAgency for Science Technology & Research (ASTAR) [R-385-000-049-305]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71572094]; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [ZR2015GM015],"This work was supported by A*Star grant (R-385-000-049-305), National Natural Science Foundation of China (71572094), and Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (ZR2015GM015).

Design/methodology/approach In an effort to address limited green supply chain management implementation strategies in disaster prone regions, the paper presents SCC as an economic, social and political implementation tool. To explore this; the study introduces SCC in a three-phase competitive advantages model adopted from the Barney 1995 model (with slight differences). Smart PLS 3.0 software package was adopted to carry out multi-variable data analysis. The study's assumption is a capital economic system and bases its argument of analysis on stockholder theoretical lenses. Findings Big company size does not significantly affect SCC, suggesting that companies of all size can organize and enhance their network to be cooperative. Companies with cooperative supply chain network tend to have competitive advantages. SCC is also a viable way to manage business risks, be there internal or external. Research limitations/implications One of the study's limitation is the stockholder theory it adopts, which shoulders its assumptions on a capital economic model of operation. Indeed, the study covered China, which is seen to be a communist-based economy. Another study's limitation is that it narrows its data collection to disaster prone areas as documented by Guha-Sapir et al. (2012). Consequently, the findings of this study might be only applicable to areas that experience significant level of disruptions usually caused by disaster incidents. Originality/value The study is also the first of its kind to propose a model for automobile manufacturing in disaster prone regions. This is done by introducing SCC as an economic, social and political factor, while risk ranking is introduced as an environmental factor to constitute the external changes that Barney 1995 introduced.","[Montshiwa, Abednico Lopang] Tohoku Daigaku, Dept Management Sci & Technol, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan","Montshiwa, AL (corresponding author), Tohoku Daigaku, Dept Management Sci & Technol, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.",abedm39@gmail.com,,,,,,46,1,1,3,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1059-5422,2051-3143,,COMPET REV,Compet.

Why are some teams better than others in facing this challenge? This paper addresses these questions by investigating two drivers of team resilience: the team size and the density of social interactions among team members. We adopt a complex system approach and employ a model of team decision-making where collective dynamics of team members are governed by a continuous-time Markov process. The model simulates team performance in complex and turbulent environments. It is used to measure the resilient ability of team to quickly adapt to disturbance and secure a new more desirable condition. Scenarios characterized by increasing levels of complexity and turbulence are simulated, and the resilience performance is calculated and compared. Results show that the team size negatively affects the team resilience, whilst the density of social interactions plays a positive influence, especially at a high level of complexity. We also find that both the magnitude and the frequency of disturbance moderate the relationship between team size/density and the team resilience.","[Giannoccaro, Ilaria; Massari, Giovanni F.; Carbone, Giuseppe] Politecn Bari, Dipartimento Meccan Matemat & Management, Viale Japigia 182, I-70126 Bari, Italy; [Carbone, Giuseppe] Univ North Texas, Ctr Nonlinear Sci, POB 311427, Denton, TX 76203 USA","Carbone, G (corresponding author), Politecn Bari, Dipartimento Meccan Matemat & Management, Viale Japigia 182, I-70126 Bari, Italy.; Carbone, G (corresponding author), Univ North Texas, Ctr Nonlinear Sci, POB 311427, Denton, TX 76203 USA.",carbone@poliba.it,"Carbone, Giuseppe/G-7816-2011; Giannoccaro, Ilaria/H-6875-2013","Carbone, Giuseppe/0000-0002-8919-6796; ",,,,75,9,9,2,26,WILEY-HINDAWI,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",1076-2787,1099-0526,,COMPLEXITY,Complexity,,2018,,,,,,,,,1923216,10.1155/2018/1923216,,,11,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Multidisciplinary Sciences",Mathematics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,GP5LG,WOS:000440914300001,,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2021-03-04

One of the most critical factors influencing the sustainability of an agro-food supply chain is its network design. A particularly challenging aspect in this context is the broad range of influencing indicators associated with the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) of sustainability that need to be considered. However, many of these indicators could not be fully integrated or measured by single-step optimization problems. This paper presents a critical literature review of operational research methods for the design of sustainable supply chains. A novel two-stage hybrid solution methodology is proposed. In the first stage, a partner selection is performed using a hybrid multi criteria decision making based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method and the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) aggregation method. The result obtained in the first stage is used in the second stage to develop a multi-objective mathematical model to optimize the design of the supply chain network. This approach allows the simultaneous consideration of all three dimensions of sustainability including carbon footprint, water footprint, number of jobs created and the total cost of the supply chain design. The proposed approach generates a Pareto frontier to aid users in making decisions. Numerical experiments are completed utilizing data from an agro-food company to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution methodology. The analyzes of the numerical results provide important organizational, practical and policy insights on (I) the impact of financial and environmental sustainability on supply chain network design (2) the tradeoff analysis between environmental emission, water footprint, societal implications and associated cost for making informed decision on supply chain investment.

Baijiu is one of the world's oldest distilled alcoholic beverages and plays a significant role in Chinese culture and Chinese people's daily life. As the production and consumption of Baijiu have a significant influence on the economic, environmental, and social performance of supply chain management, sustainable supply chain network design decisions are critical to the long-term success of the industry. In concert with the rapidly growing Chinese economy, there is a growing demand for a sustainable Baijiu industry. Therefore, this paper constructs and optimizes a network decision-support model for a sustainable Baijiu industry network design. To achieve this, the Baijiu supply chain is examined and a model is proposed for a design that encompasses economic (costs), environmental (carbon emissions), and social (local employment and regional per capita GDP) dimensions. R language programming is then applied to solve the model. A case example indicated that S1 was the optimal decision for reducing costs, S2 was the optimal solution for minimizing carbon emissions, and S3 was the best for maximizing the social impact. Considering the situation of the Baijiu industry and the focal enterprise, it was concluded that S1 would be the best solution for the case company. And the results verified the effectiveness of the framework. This paper develops a systematic and effective approach that decision-makers can use to conduct sustainable network design for Baijiu enterprises.","[Jiang, Xianglan] Sichuan Univ Sci & Engn, Sch Management, Zigong 643000, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Xianglan] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jiuping] Sichuan Univ, Uncertainty Decis Making Lab, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Luo, Jiarong] Southwest Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Mianyang 621010, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Fei] Beijing Sci & Technol Co, Three Fast Online, Beijing 100080, Peoples R China","Xu, JP (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Uncertainty Decis Making Lab, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",xujiuping@scu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71671118, 71702156]; Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education of ChinaMinistry of Education, China [17YJC630098]; Sichuan Provincial Education Department of Key Research Base Key Program [CJZ17-02]; Doctoral Fund Project of Sichuan University of Science and Engineering [2017RCSK21]; General Project of Sichuan Education Department [18SB0400]","The authors are very grateful to Zhibin Wu for his constructive comments and valuable suggestions.

Using the illustrative case of Seven & I (S&I) Holdings, the paper positions OCR in terms of its goal to provide added customer value through a seamless brand experience. Design/methodology/approach The research uses a case study methodology, based on a series of in-depth interviews. Executives at S&I were interviewed as the core of the case, and supporting interviews were carried out with executives at Yamato Transport, Inditex Japan and Rakuten. Data collected in interviews were cross-referenced to industry and trade press reports, providing an illustration of the motivation and strategic decisions behind the transition to OCR, and of factors that have direct impact on the implementation of the model. Findings The results illustrate the difficulty in achieving OCR in terms of unifying customer experience across multiple channels. The case demonstrates the potential for cross-channel integration through multiple, but integrated touchpoints, and the leveraging of existing multichannel retail infrastructure and systems. In addition to confirming previous conceptual understanding of the transition process, the core findings demonstrate the importance of the strategic implementation process, the importance of the retailer's brand portfolio and brand management, and the need to adjust and leverage existing facilities and infrastructure. Research limitations/implications The study is limited by the single case employed, although the complexity of OCR implementation does not take away from the practical implications in a broader sense. It could be argued that the Japanese retail industry has some differences to other markets, but the customer-orientated nature of S&I's implementation, and its aim to leverage existing infrastructure, is illustrative for similar strategies of retailers elsewhere in the world. Practical implications The study has value to both researchers and practitioners as a structured synopsis of an actual case of transition, and adds to the literature that relates to OCR and to Japanese distribution. It demonstrates not only the need for robust supply chain, logistics, IT, marketing and retail infrastructure, and integration across distribution systems, but also the importance of the retailer's brand portfolio, which may need significant adjustment to best promote added customer value. The success of S&I is predicated on both the high population densities, characteristic of the Japanese market, and a strong, longstanding MCR base. Similar systems and implementation issues apply to other markets that operate under similar conditions. Social implications The social implications of the paper relate to the fact that, although the transition to OCR may be a difficult, costly, and time-consuming proposition for a retailer, increasingly consumers are coming to expect both informational and purchasing options for brands to be available as, when and where they want them. The 24-7 nature of omnichannel also generates significant challenges in terms of work volumes and environmental impact. These issues are touched upon this paper. Originality/value This paper provides a case of a major and well-known retailer and the transition process towards an OCR model, of which there are currently few case studies available. It also adds significantly to the body of literature relating to Japanese distribution and provides insights into strategy not generally known in the English-speaking world.","[Larke, Roy; Kilgour, Mark; O'Connor, Huw] Univ Waikato, Waikato Management Sch, Dept Mkt, Hamilton, New Zealand","Larke, R (corresponding author), Univ Waikato, Waikato Management Sch, Dept Mkt, Hamilton, New Zealand.",rlarke@waikato.ac.nz; kilgour@waikato.ac.nz; huwo@waikato.ac.nz,"O'Connor, Huw/R-8607-2019","O'Connor, Huw/0000-0001-6969-722X",,,,90,25,25,7,115,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0960-0035,1758-664X,,INT J PHYS DISTR LOG,Int.

At the same time, firms still need to achieve economic viability and retain their competitive advantage. Because suppliers are the first entity and the initial source of any supply chain, organisations should select their suppliers by a careful evaluation of their critical success factors (CSF). Achieving a successful sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) strategy requires a firm to consider its stakeholders' views. Based on the CSF theory and by considering the multi stakeholders' view in a sustainability perspective, this work provides a decision support system for the sustainable supplier selection (SSS) problem in a real world textile industry located in the emerging economy of India. Through a three-phase methodology, this study examines Indian suppliers by considering the sustainability views of various stakeholders, including employees, customers, researchers, shareholders, and a government environmental officer. The CSF priorities show that the first four influential CSFs are categorized as social concerns (i.e., maintaining long-term relationships and affiances, stakeholder empowerment, equity labour sources, and individual human rights). The fifth factor is an environmental issue (i.e., production of polluting agents). Among the five suppliers being evaluated in this work, Supplier 4 receives the top ranking. Specifically, the results show that the supplier rankings are highly influenced by CSF's social dimensions. Hence, to validate the influence of CSF's social dimensions in relation to the SSS process, a sensitivity analysis has been done by varying the respective weights. The study concludes with the relevant managerial implications and limitations.","[Kannan, Devika] Univ Southern Denmark, Ctr Sustainable Supply Chain Engn, Dept Technol & Innovat, Odense M, Denmark","Kannan, D (corresponding author), Univ Southern Denmark, Ctr Sustainable Supply Chain Engn, Dept Technol & Innovat, Odense M, Denmark.",deka@iti.sdu.dk,"Kannan, Devika/Q-6233-2018","Kannan, Devika/0000-0003-4365-0313",,,,260,82,83,25,173,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-5273,1873-7579,,INT J PROD ECON,Int.

Initially, the technological expertise factor was noted as very important for sustaining green product innovation. Furthermore, since proactive leaders are an important factor for successfully developing environmentally sustainable products, it must be added to technological expertise as the foundation for developing green innovation. After defining the basis for green product innovation, the intermediary conditions necessary for using the available technology appropriately were mapped out. In this sense, variables such as elimination of cultural barriers, capacity for critical reflective analysis, and experimentation are also very important.

This theory, as posited, sheds a great deal of light on the behavioural reality of how supply chain managers operate within the social aspects of their risk environments. Design/methodology/approach The paper is presented as a narrative synthesis of classical realist sociological literature. Findings The Machiavellian approach provides a template that can be used to help academics and practitioners understand how and why supply chain managers orient themselves to the social threats they confront in very different ways. The theory's contention that the behavioural reality can be subdivided between two basic patterns allows it to serve as a constructively simple template for becoming attuned to ways in which supply chain managers socially construct and act within their social threat environments. Research limitations/implications The growing social complexity of supply chains gives behavioural responses a complexity reduction function. The authors theorise that such patterns, once activated, may not necessarily adapt rationally as guides to optimise the chance of success against the full range of social threats they are likely to encounter. Originality/value Cross-disciplinary supply chain management research is increasingly drawing upon sociology and behavioural science to facilitate greater understanding of not only the supply chain environment but also the roles of supply chain managers as relationship influencers and managers of conflict. The authors posit that Machiavellian-realist social theory can contribute to supply chain management scholarship by offering a constructively simple approach to evaluate the behavioural realities associated with social threats.","[Marshall, Alasdair; Chipulu, Maxwell] Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Southampton, Hants, England; [Bashir, Hamdi; Ojiako, Udechukwu] Univ Sharjah, Coll Engn, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Ojiako, Udechukwu] Univ Hull, Sch Business, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England","Ojiako, U (corresponding author), Univ Sharjah, Coll Engn, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.; Ojiako, U (corresponding author), Univ Hull, Sch Business, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England.",A.Marshall@soton.ac.uk; hbashir@sharjah.ac.ae; udechukwu.ojiako@outlook.com; m.chipulu@soton.ac.uk,"Bashir, Hamdi/AAZ-3994-2020; Chipulu, Maxwell/C-2308-2013","Marshall, Alasdair/0000-0002-9789-8042; Ojiako, Udechukwu/0000-0003-0506-2115; Chipulu, Maxwell/0000-0002-0139-6188",,,,123,4,4,4,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2040-8269,2040-8277,,MANAG RES REV,Manag.

Automotive industry experts are increasingly focussing on improving the supply efficiency and performance towards gaining sustainable competitive advantage. This study aims to classify, through an exhaustive review of past literature, the various enablers and barriers of strategic sourcing risk management (SSRM) and use them to identify the problems in the automobile sector. Design/methodology/approach - For the purpose of this research, responses were collected through structured questionnaire from respondents belonging to senior management cadre in the industry. Factor analysis and force field analysis tools have been used for analysis. Findings - Through independent exploratory factor analysis (EFA), four SSRM enablers, namely, supplier risk assessment, data sharing in supply network, partnership with supplier and supply flexibility, were identified. Similarly EFA revealed four SSRM barriers, namely, cost focus, ad hoc or poor planning, data security/privy breaches and hard visualization of SSRM benefits. Through a force field analysis, it was found out that the barriers had a higher impact on the SSRM initiatives than enablers. Practical implications - The research suggests the ways how managers can reduce the impact of barriers and increase the enabling forces. Originality/value - This paper enumerates the barriers and enablers together on the same platform to prioritize and evolve strategies to overpower the barriers and strengthen the enablers.","[Sharma, Satyendra Kumar; Singh, Ravinder; Matai, Rajesh] Birla Inst Technol & Sci, Pilani, Rajasthan, India","Sharma, SK (corresponding author), Birla Inst Technol & Sci, Pilani, Rajasthan, India.",satyendra.sharma1979@gmail.com; ravinderdalal@yahoo.com; rajeshmatai73@gmail.com,"sharma, Satyendra/W-9088-2019; MATAI, RAJESH/K-8177-2012; MATAI, RAJESH/AAB-1086-2019","MATAI, RAJESH/0000-0002-0422-0639; MATAI, RAJESH/0000-0002-0422-0639",,,,62,2,2,3,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1368-3047,1758-8057,,MEAS BUS EXCELL,Meas.

Whereas some authors emphasised that company characteristics, like the product demand profile, are significant factors in lean projects, other studies analysed the impact of national culture. This paper aims to study the combined effect of various factors related to national culture and company characteristics of lean implementation barriers in order to determine whether the environmental context in which the company operation can affect the outcome of lean project implementation. A survey has been conducted to collect information about companies of various sizes (small-medium-large) in all industry fields. Data from companies, including manufacturing firms, in 23 different countries, were analysed in depth by a combination of Association Rules and Network Analysis. The results show that some national culture dimensions, such as Performance Orientation and Gender Egalitarianism, influence lean management success and help to maintain a lean culture. Maintaining a lean culture is even more critical than developing it. Furthermore, if the implementation of lean practices is an arduous task for large organisations, it becomes even greater for SMEs. Other cultural factors of individuals such as Uncertainty Avoidance, Future Orientation and Institutional Collectivism also help to support a lean culture and overcome human and cultural barriers.","[DeSanctis, Ilaria; Bevilacqua, Maurizio; Ciarapica, Filippo Emanuele] Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Ingn Ind & Sci Matemat, Via Brecce Bianche, I-60131 Ancona, Italy; [Ordieres Mere, Joaquin Bienvenido] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Ingn Org, Adm Empresas & Estadist, Madrid, Spain","Ciarapica, FE (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Ingn Ind & Sci Matemat, Via Brecce Bianche, I-60131 Ancona, Italy.",f.ciarapica@univpm.it,"Ordieres-Mere, Joaquin/B-9677-2011; Bevilacqua, Maurizio/B-4816-2012","Ordieres-Mere, Joaquin/0000-0002-9677-6764; Ciarapica, Filippo Emanuele/0000-0002-8908-433X; Bevilacqua, Maurizio/0000-0003-3064-3915",,,,112,10,10,3,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-7287,1366-5871,,PROD PLAN CONTROL,Prod.

However, while reverse logistics is becoming a mandatory element of the supply chain in developed countries particularly due to legislation issues, the subject is still in a state of infancy in emerging economies such as Brazil. In these connections, impediments to reverse logistics implementation must be considered and analyzed, as well as the many different perspectives from the key stakeholders for their development. The objective of this research is to evaluate the interrelationship among reverse logistics barriers from the perspectives of the most important stakeholders in the Brazilian context. For this purpose, a Multi-Criteria Decision Making tool named grey-based Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (grey-DEMATEL) was used to extract a multiple company-customer-government association perspective. Three respondents - one expert from each stakeholder - have been consulted to obtain the pair-wise comparison of barriers. Thus, both the net effect and the importance level of each impediment are provided by means of a Euclidean distance analysis, as well as the similarities and differences among stakeholders' opinions. The uniqueness of this paper relies on the fact that no previous work was found in the domain of multiple stakeholders' perspective for reverse logistics barriers. This research uncovers that most of the key barriers from the reverse logistics multiple perspectives framework are from the organizational point of view. This stakeholder holds 10 out of 13 key barriers for RL implementation; as such, it is an important outcome because it indicates that firms may begin product return implementation by first tackling key internal barriers. Moreover, knowing the influential factors in their environment may assist industry managers to better implement and manage reverse flows, and to see through current and future green solutions for reverse logistics.

One key strategy to improve energy efficiency is to create a network of multiple sectors that can produce and utilize energy from waste. This mechanism has already been adopted at the urban scale in several developed countries as a way to enhance environmental efficiency and reduce adverse impacts. However, to use waste efficiently, it is necessary to examine the supply chain of wastes as a source of materials with potential to generate energy. Such an examination can inform the design of an efficient waste-to-energy process that will create a symbiosis between industry and the waste management sector. In this paper, we describe a model that evaluates energy recovery efficiency by considering the costs and benefits of an innovative waste-to-energy system. In the model, we also consider the material and energy flow of wastes in accordance with the quantity and quality of waste emissions, the separation system, treatment technologies and combinations thereof, and energy recovery and use in other sectors. The scenario was designed by identifying waste management options, including waste quantity/quality; the separation system; the treatment technology model for wet or dry methane fermentation; incineration; a combined system that involves superheating with exchanging heat between the incineration plant and fermenter; and use of refuse paper and plastic fuel (RPF). The results revealed that energy recovery efficiency was most dependent on the effective use of RPF with a relatively high lower heating value and superheating of boiler steam by methane gas in the combined system. An important conclusion was that the most efficient system was a combined system in which paper, plastic, and RPF were separated from 80% of the waste, and 20% of the waste was incinerated and used for wet methane fermentation. The amounts of energy recovered from that system was 54.5 kWh/t, and the efficiency was 33.4%. Analytical results indicated that it is possible to create the critical technology and to develop policy insights needed to make efficient waste management systems for the transition to low-carbon cities.

Due to the strategic importance of having a sustainable network, it is necessary to have an enhanced supply chain network risk management. In a supply chain network many firms depend directly or indirectly on a specific supplier. In this regard, unknown risks of network's structure can endanger the whole supply chain network's robustness. In spite of the importance of risk identification of supply chain network, firms are not willing to exchange the structural information of their network. Firms are concerned about risking their strategic positioning or established connections in the network. The paper proposes to combine secure multiparty computation cryptography methods with risk identification algorithms from social network analysis to address this challenge. The combination enables structural risk identification of supply chain networks without endangering firms' competitive advantage.","[Zare-Garizy, Tirazheh] Univ Augsburg, FIM Res Ctr, Univ Str 12, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany; [Fridgen, Gilbert] Univ Bayreuth, FIM Res Ctr, Wittelsbacherring 10, D-95444 Bayreuth, Germany; [Wederhake, Lars] Univ Augsburg, Project Grp Business & Informat Syst Engn Fraunho, D-86135 Augsburg, Germany","Wederhake, L (corresponding author), Univ Augsburg, Project Grp Business & Informat Syst Engn Fraunho, D-86135 Augsburg, Germany.",lars.wederhake@fit.fraunhofer.de,,"Fridgen, Gilbert/0000-0001-7037-4807","DFG (German Research Foundation)German Research Foundation (DFG) [FR 2987/2-1, BU 809/13-1]","This research was (in part) carried out in the context of the Project Group Business and Information Systems Engineering of the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology FIT.

To be effective, the industry environmental footprint needs to address holistically via closed-loop supply chains (CLSC). This research proposes an optimization approach to address CLSC design problem with carbon footprint considerations. It integrates the carbon emission policies into supply chain's strategic, tactical and operational selection decisions. A robust counterpart of the proposed model is developed based on three alternative uncertainty sets. The model extends further to investigate the impact of the three commonly practiced carbon regulatory policies including carbon cap, carbon tax, and carbon cap-and-trade on the supply chain strategic and operational decisions. Numerical results indicate that carbon cap-and-trade policy is the most flexible and efficient policy as compared to carbon cap and carbon tax policies. This study provides insightful observations with respect to robust optimization, CLSC network decisions, and carbon emissions. The proposed robust optimization models could be useful to decision-makers to achieve a robust supply chain network which can withstand any possible uncertainty in a given uncertainty set.","[Mohammed, Fareeduddin; Hassan, Adnan] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Engn, Sch Mech Engn, Johor Baharu, Malaysia; [Selim, Shokri Z.] King Fand Univ Petr & Minerals, Syst Engn Dept, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia","Mohammed, F (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Engn, Sch Mech Engn, Johor Baharu, Malaysia.",fareeduddinm@gmail.com,"Mohammed, Fareeduddin/ABD-3459-2020; Hassan, Adnan/Q-2617-2019","Hassan, Adnan/0000-0002-3980-8942",,,,52,3,2,2,8,UNIV CINCINNATI INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING,CINCINNATI,"UNIV CINCINNATI, CINCINNATI, OH 45221-0116 USA",1943-670X,,,INT J IND ENG-THEORY,Int.

Reverse supply chain (RSC) is the probable strategy to cope up with the issue. Setting up a RSC process is not popular in the Indian sector. There are several factors that basically control the profitability of such kind of business. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to develop a causal model among the identified issues and sub-issues for setting up a RSC in an Indian semiconductor manufacturing industry and then evaluate the critical issues based on the causal relations. Design/methodology/approach Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method along fuzzy set theory is used to develop the causal framework among the identified strategical and tactical issues. According to the causal relations from DEMATEL, analytical network process is then used to identify the weights of the sub-issues. Findings The cause-effect interactions among the main issues show that legislations and regulations, market-related issues and organizational issue are the most significant strategic issues. Uncertainty in the acquisition time is the most significant tactical issue because it has a crucial impact on the quality and quantity of the used products. Based on the obtained causal relations of the main issues, it is identified that the reduction of waste, creation of new opportunity, market competition, cost reduction, change in technology and location, capacity and number of recovery facility are the major sub-issues in RSC implementation. Practical implications This study is conducted on the basis of the experts' opinion from a semiconductor manufacturing industry, situated in the southern part of India. Therefore, this proves its practical implications. Originality/value The paper provides the detail illustration of the issues in the RSC process, and the prioritization of the issues based on the cause-effect relationships also provides some meaningful managerial insights.","[Chakraborty, Kaustov] IFHE Univ, IBS Hyderabad, Dept Operat & IT, Hyderabad, Telangana, India; [Mondal, Sandeep] Indian Sch Mines, Indian Inst Technol, Dept Management Studies, Dhanbad, Bihar, India; [Mukherjee, Kampan] Indian Inst Management, Kashipur, India","Chakraborty, K (corresponding author), IFHE Univ, IBS Hyderabad, Dept Operat & IT, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.",kaustovchakraborty8@gmail.com; mondal.s.ms@ismdhanbad.ac.in; kampanmukherjee@iimkashipur.ac.in,"Mondal, Sandeep/AAB-9618-2020; Mondal, Sandeep/M-5083-2013; CHAKRABORTY, KAUSTOV/AAL-7535-2020","Mondal, Sandeep/0000-0003-1286-5821; CHAKRABORTY, KAUSTOV/0000-0002-3744-6482",,,,69,2,2,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-5771,1758-4094,,BENCHMARKING,Benchmarking,,2018,25,7,,,,,1992,2017,,10.1108/BIJ-12-2016-0181,,,26,Management,Business & Economics,GU0UG,WOS:000444967600002,,,,,2021-03-04

Confucianist society forms social networks in Confucianist society, called guanxi networks, influence economic behaviours and business practices in the workplace. The purpose of this study is to explore how these social networks influence the implementation of sustainable SCM. In doing so, this study aims to critically investigate the constructs of guanxi networks, their impact on flow of supply chain capital and how this leverages the implementation of sustainable SCM. Design/methodology/approach Two systematic literature reviews are conducted to understand the constructs of social networks in Confucianist culture and their impacts on the flow of supply chain capitals. The reviews also analyse evidence related to the economic, social and environmental practices to reveal the current state of the literature and research gaps. Propositions and a framework are developed to support future research in this area. Findings The constructs of ganqing, renqing, xinren and mianzi in guanxi networks have expanded the contexts of social networks in Western literature. Guanxi networks increase the flow of supply chain capital and generate trust between players, thus enhancing capabilities to implement sustainable SCM. Guanxi networks also create the mechanism of network governance with which to increase sustainable SCM implementation under the institutional logics of sustainability. Research limitations/implications The conceptual framework and justification are based on the reviews of current studies in the field. Future empirical study is encouraged to test the propositions, both in Confucianist culture and other countries with culture of social networks. Originality/value Social networks are socially constructed concepts. The constructs of guanxi networks revealed in this study have developed the knowledge of Western-based social network theory. Besides, arguments from a social network perspective provide an alternative answer to explain increased behavioural commitment and companies' investment in sustainable SCM. This study helps practitioners understand the logic of this social norm and to use it to maximise their operation outputs, including sustainable SCM implementation.","[Lu, Haiyan Emma] Univ Plymouth, Plymouth Business Sch, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Lu, Haiyan Emma] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Ringgold Stand Inst, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Potter, Andrew; Walker, Helen] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Rodrigues, Vasco Sanchez] Cardiff Univ, Dept Business, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales","Lu, HE (corresponding author), Univ Plymouth, Plymouth Business Sch, Plymouth, Devon, England.; Lu, HE (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Ringgold Stand Inst, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",Haiyan.Lu@plymouth.ac.uk,,"Potter, Andrew/0000-0002-3157-9735",,,,140,13,13,11,56,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1359-8546,1758-6852,,SUPPLY CHAIN MANAG,Supply Chain Manag.,,2018,23,4,,,,,257,277,,10.1108/SCM-11-2016-0408,,,21,Business; Management,Business & Economics,GR0TV,WOS:000442237100001,,Green Accepted,,,2021-03-04

Design/methodology/approach This study is an exploratory case study of the South Australian (SA) mining industry that includes 38 semi-structured interviews with the key stakeholders and structural analysis of the regional supply network (RSN). Findings Findings demonstrate the applicability of the CAS framework as a structured approach to the governance of the mining industry regional supply chains. In particular, the findings exemplify the relationship between RSN governance, its structure and interconnectivity and their combined impact on the adaptability and resilience of mining regions. Research limitations/implications The data set analysed in the current study is static. Longitudinal data would permit a deeper insight into the evolution of the RSN structure and connectivity. The validity of the proposed framework could be further strengthened by being applied to other industrial domains and geographical contexts. Practical/implications The proposed framework offers a novel insight for regional policy-makers striving to create an environment that facilitates the formation of well-integrated regional supply chains in mining regions through more focussed policy and strategies. Originality/value The proposed framework is one of the first attempts to offer a holistic structured approach to governance of the regional supply chains based on CAS principles. With the current transformative changes in the global mining industry, policy-makers and supply chain practitioners have an urgent need to embrace CAS and network paradigms to remain competitive in the twenty-first century.","[Statsenko, Larissa; Gorod, Alex; Ireland, Vernon] Univ Adelaide, Fac Profess, ECIC, Adelaide, SA, Australia","Statsenko, L (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Fac Profess, ECIC, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",larissa.statsenko@adelaide.edu.au,,"Statsenko, Larissa/0000-0002-2671-3936","Mining Industry Participation Office, the Government of South Australia [56116387]","The research was supported by the Mining Industry Participation Office, the Government of South Australia.

Design/methodology/approach - A total of 60 restaurateurs located in a small Italian city and 100 owners of micro and small-sized farms, located within a 30 km radius from the city, have been interviewed. The collected data have been analysed through descriptive analysis and Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests for differences between gender, production type and business size. Findings - The results agree with existing literature: poor communication and an unstructured logistics limit the interaction among actors. However, significant for the purpose, the data show that producers are interested in expanding their market and restaurateurs are interested in a broader supply of local products, and they both open to a logistics service that improves the supply of local food. Research limitations/implications - The following exploratory study is based on a sample of farmers and restaurants in a specific area so the results could not be generalised in a national/international context. Practical implications - The logistics service objective is the promotion of a sustainable territory development in support of the social economy values. Originality/value - The study investigates this issue focussing on a practical solution of local food distribution system among restaurants.

In this technological era, many firms are reliant on technological platforms to share mission critical information between their business units to prevent bullwhip effect due to information lag, and to improve coordination and collaboration among the units. Extant literature reveals that there is a strong research emphasis on information sharing practices between firms, and little on the information sharing practices within the firms for supply chain efficiencies. There is also limited research done to understand the impacts of information quality e.g. sharing mechanism, accuracy, timeliness and relevance have on the management of supply chains. Research often tend to focus on information sharing practices in modern businesses that utilises sophisticated IT systems for supply chain management, and neglects the business firms that operating in less developed environments.

After their useful life, they become e-waste which has considerable impacts on the environment and society. To mitigate the issue, the reverse supply chain (RSC) has been investigated to reuse components or recycle raw materials contained in e-waste. The total cost of RSC operation is one of the vital issues which has been receiving more attention from both industry and academia. The existing research concentrates on minimizing the overall cost of the system like transportation, operating, disposal and fixed costs. However, risks normally involved during the transportation of e-waste in RSC network has not been addressed. These risks might involve collection delays, breakdown of trucks, accidents and the variation of hazardous materials which can result in unexpected disruptions and significantly higher cost. Currently, there is no research incorporating transportation risk in RSC operation. This paper is aimed to develop a mathematical model for the total cost minimization of an e-waste RSC system with consideration of transportation risk. A mixed integer linear programming is applied in the proposed model and solved by an optimization software. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed model, a numerical example is also examined. The results of this paper can decide the optimal locations for treatment centers and the flow of used products or components delivered within an e-waste RSC network. This result can support managers to design an e-waste RSC network whilst transportation risk factors are considered.","[Linh Thi Truc Doan; Amer, Yousef; Lee, Sang-Heon] Univ South Australia, Sch Engn, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Linh Thi Truc Doan] Can Tho Univ, Dept Ind Management, Can Tho, Vietnam; [Phan Nguyen Ky Phuc] Ho Chi Minh Int Univ, Dept Ind Syst Engn, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","Doan, LTT (corresponding author), Univ South Australia, Sch Engn, Adelaide, SA, Australia.; Doan, LTT (corresponding author), Can Tho Univ, Dept Ind Management, Can Tho, Vietnam.",linh.doan@mymail.unisa.edu.au,,,Australian GovernmentAustralian GovernmentCGIAR,"The first author would like to thank the Australian Government for sponsoring her PhD program at University of South Australia, Australia under an Endeavour Award.",,30,4,4,1,7,OSCM FORUM,BALI,"OSCM FORUM, BALI, 00000, INDONESIA",1979-3561,2579-9363,,OPER SUPPLY CHAIN MA,Oper.

In this paper, we focus on environmental (ecological) risks in supply chains which represent threats of adverse effects on living organisms, facilities and environment by effluents, emissions, wastes, resource depletion, etc. arising due to supply chain's activities. Harmful environmental disruptions may ripple through the supply chain components like a wave. The paper presents the entropy-based optimisation model for reducing the supply chain model size and assessing the economic loss caused by the environmental risks subject to the ripple effect. A main advantage of the suggested entropy-based approach is that it permits to essentially simplify the hierarchical tree-like model of the supply chain, at the same time retaining the basic knowledge about main risk sources.","[Levner, Eugene] Holon Inst Technol, Comp Sci Dept, Holon, Israel; [Ptuskin, Alexander] Bauman Moscow State Tech Univ, Dept Econ & Enterprise Management, Kaluga, Russia","Levner, E (corresponding author), Holon Inst Technol, Comp Sci Dept, Holon, Israel.",levner@hit.ac.il,"Levner, Eugene/U-9238-2019; Ptuskin, Alexander/G-8793-2013","Ptuskin, Alexander/0000-0002-1192-5506",Russian Foundation for Basic ResearchRussian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [16-12-40002a/p],This work was supported by the grant of Russian Foundation for Basic Research [grant number 16-12-40002a/p].,,39,31,31,8,35,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

But there are also so-called grey swan events, equally destructive, but not utterly unpredictable. They have already occurred in the past, perhaps in related production settings. We present a dynamic model that analyses how grey swan events originate in supply networks and how they can be prevented. Most of the literature so far has focused on external risks, beyond the scope of managerial control. This paper introduces a formal model in which a central role is played by management and its inability to observe and act timely on signals of growing operational issues which cause grey swan events. The paper starts with an empirical investigation of one grey swan event, the Airbus A380 introduction. Our model can replicate this type of grey swan behaviour. With this model, we conduct a system dynamics analysis of the mechanisms that can create or prevent a particular type of grey swan event, a business tsunami. The level of managerial preparedness to actively search for the grey swans' is found to be a key prerequisite to prevent destructive impact on production supply networks. Our paper suggests ways in which the field of production research can help foster such structurally high managerial preparedness.","[Akkermans, Henk A.] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sch Econ & Management, Dept Management, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Van Wassenhove, Luk N.] INSEAD, Technol & Operat Management, Frontainebleau, France","Van Wassenhove, LN (corresponding author), INSEAD, Technol & Operat Management, Frontainebleau, France.",luk.van-wassenhove@insead.edu,,"Akkermans, Henk/0000-0001-6365-1052",,,,31,4,4,0,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

The results of our study yield three main categories of barriers. These barriers are knowledge-related (lack of awareness of the environmental impacts on business, lack of training courses/consultancy/institutions to train, monitor/mentor progress specific to each industry, lack of technical expertise and difficulty in identifying environmental opportunities), commitment-related (lack of corporate social responsibility) and product design-related (complexity of design to reuse/recycle used products). The proposed study is one of the first few to be conducted in the Canadian context for green supply chain barrier analysis for electronic goods sector.

Preventative maintenance of water pipes, especially in urban-scale networks, thus becomes a vital importance. To achieve this goal, failure prediction that aims to pro-actively pinpoint those most-risky-to-fail'' pipes becomes critical and has been attracting wide attention from government, academia, and industry. Different from classification-, regression-, or ranking-based methods, this paper adopts a point process-based framework that incorporates both the past failure event data and individual pipe-specific pro file including physical, environmental, and operational covariants. In particular, based on a common wisdom of previous work that the failure event sequences typically exhibit temporal clustering distribution, we use mutual-exciting point process to model such triggering effects for different failure types.

Thus, the purpose of this paper is to advance knowledge by challenging classical stakeholder theory with fundamental insights from the IMP perspective, which in turn leads to a deeper conceptualization of interactive CS. Design/methodology/approach A typology framework is developed through an abductive research design grounded in the concepts of actors, resources, and activities. The authors illustrate the potential of the framework through a longitudinal case study. The empirical case revolves around an initiative for recycling of plastic material in a partly beforehand established supply chain, and the study reveals three main findings. Findings First, recycling solutions can result in major technological challenges. For example, using recycled material can jeopardize industrial quality standards. Second, third-party stakeholders represent critical knowledge and competence that can remedy technological challenges. Finally, R&D projects are important means for developing firm-stakeholder relationships. Research limitations/implications The paper introduces IMP concepts to the CS debate, which can illuminate the emerging literature on tensions and paradoxes related to CS phenomena. Further research is needed on the role of non-business actors as capacity generators for social and environmental change in traditional business networks. Practical implications The proposed framework can be used to analyze why some stakeholders (individuals and groups) turn into contributing actors in inter-organizational relationships, while others remain latent. Originality/value This paper illustrates the usefulness of actor bonds, resource ties and activity links as explanatory concepts. Moreover, developed relationships in terms of collaboration and networks represent a capacity to change, which is overlooked in current CS debates.","[Vildasen, Sigurd Sagen; Havenvid, Malena Ingemansson] NTNU, Trondheim, Norway","Vildasen, SS (corresponding author), NTNU, Trondheim, Norway.",sigurd.vildasen@ntnu.no; malena.havenvid@ntnu.no,,"Vildasen, Sigurd/0000-0002-4202-4663",,,,72,3,3,2,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2059-1403,0809-7259,,IMP J,IMP J.,,2018,12,1,,,,,148,170,,10.1108/IMP-05-2017-0016,,,23,Business,Business & Economics,FY8YB,WOS:000427150600008,,,,,2021-03-04

Design/methodology/approach The transport network impedance is estimated as the potential hindrance to LMD as imposed by the characteristics of the built and regulatory environment. A matrix of key transport and planning measures are generated and overlaid in geographical information systems to compute and visualise the levels of transportation network impedance to LMD using a composite indexing method. Findings The mapped outputs reveal significant spatial variation in transportation network impedance to LMD across different part of the study area. Significant differences were detected along the road segments that connect key industrial hubs or activity centres especially along tram routes and freight corridors, connecting the Port of Melbourne and logistic hub with the airport and the Western Ring Road. Research limitations/implications The use of static measures of transport and urban planning restricts the robustness of the impedance index, which can be enhanced through better integration of dynamic and real-time movements of business-to-business LMD of goods. Spatial approach is valuable for broader urban planning at a metropolitan or council level; however, its use is somewhat limited in assisting the daily operational planning and logistics decision making in terms of dynamic routing and vehicle scheduling. Practical implications The built and regulatory environment contributes to the severity of LMD problem in urban areas. The use of land use controls as instruments to increase city compactness in strategic nodes/hubs is more likely to deter the movement of urban freight. The mapped outputs would help urban planners and logisticians in mitigating the potential delay in last-mile deliveries through devising localised strategies such as dedicated freight corridors or time-bound deliveries in congested areas of road network. Originality/value This is the first study that measured the potential transport network impedance to LMD and improved understanding of the complex interactions between urban planning measures and LMD. Micro-scale mapping of transportation network impedance at the street level adds an innovative urban planning dimension to research in the growing field of city logistics.","[Ewedairo, Kolawole; Chhetri, Prem] RMIT Univ, Sch Business IT & Logist, Coll Business, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Jie, Ferry] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Business & Law, Joondalup, Australia","Ewedairo, K (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Business IT & Logist, Coll Business, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",kola.ewedairo@rmit.edu.au,,"Jie, Ferry/0000-0002-6287-8471",,,,119,8,8,4,56,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0957-4093,1758-6550,,INT J LOGIST MANAG,Int.

Solar is one of the most promising alternative sources of energy that is widely available and environment friendly. In this respect, this paper develops a two-phase approach based on data envelopment analysis and robust optimization models to design and plan a solar photovoltaic supply chain in an uncertain environment. Applying the data envelopment analysis model, the first phase identifies the most suitable candidate locations for solar plants according to a set of technical, geographical and social criteria. The selected locations are utilized later in the optimization model. This phase is capable of reducing the computational complexity of the optimization model by removing inappropriate sites. In the second phase, the robust optimization model determines both strategic and tactical decisions of photovoltaic supply chain, while ensuring that supply chain network is stable under almost all possible realizations of uncertain parameters. The performance of the proposed approach is examined by a real case study in Iran through which important managerial and practical insights are derived. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The issues associated with robust and resilient food supply chains within a circular economy are increasingly being seen as supportive of creating enhanced levels of food security but the authors argue that this is only sustainable when strategically planned as part of a cross-enterprise, information-rich and complex supply chain. The relevance of the Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal and Environmental (PESTLE) strategic planning tool is explored to establish whether it can play a role tacking the complexity of food insecurity (i.e. a lack of food security). Design/methodology/approach - This is a viewpoint piece therefore as a result, thought, normative literature and supposition are used as a means to ground and orientate the views of the authors. Findings - The authors identify and conclude that strategic planning tools like PESTLE across enterprises may not be relevant in supporting the reduction of food insecurity. This conclusion is predicated on the heightened level of complexity surrounding the pursuit of food security and the simplistic categorisation of PESTLE factors in a linear fashion that underpin this tool. Rather, the authors' call for the use of strategic planning tools that are able to capture a large number of inter-related factors holistically. Practical implications - This insight to the inter-related factors that contribute to food insecurity will allow policy developers, decision makers and others to develop their understanding of how strategic planning can support increased levels of food security within a circular economy and across cross-enterprises. Originality/value - The authors contribute to the literature through a new insight of how normative strategic planning tools need to evolve in a complex, inter-connected world of international business and geo-politics. In doing so, it is expected that this research will motivate others to develop their line of enquiry around uncovering and exploring those inter-relationships connecting PESTLE factors.","[Irani, Zahir; Sharif, Amir M.] Univ Bradford, Fac Management & Law, Bradford, W Yorkshire, England","Irani, Z (corresponding author), Univ Bradford, Fac Management & Law, Bradford, W Yorkshire, England.",Z.Irani@bradford.ac.uk,"Sharif, Amir M./AAX-4672-2020; Rishanty, Arnita/L-1291-2018","Sharif, Amir M./0000-0003-4293-7929; ",,,,35,5,5,2,30,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1741-0398,1758-7409,,J ENTERP INF MANAG,J.

It has resulted in heavy economic, social, and environmental losses. Undoubtedly, the first step to cope with droughts and their consequences is to have an accurate understanding of droughts and their effects on different aspects by specifying the related strategies and approaches in this regard. Given the importance of this issue, the present study was conducted to investigate how to model farmers' perception of consequences of drought through structural equation modeling in Birjand Township, Iran. All farmer households living in rural areas of Birjand (a city in the Iranian province of Southern Khorasan) composed the statistical population of this study (N=6057). As many as 200 households were chosen for the study by using Bartlett's table. In total, 20 villages were considered as the target districts using stratified random sampling. The results showed that the most important consequences of droughts understood by the farmers are their economic (0.341), environmental (0.261), and social (0.138) consequences. The highest indirect effects on the farmers' perception of consequences of drought in Birjand were: reduced income (0.286), increased bank debts (0.272), reduced purchasing power (0.265), and the wells, aqueducts and springs that have dried (0.224) respectively. In this regard, measures such as supporting the investment and entrepreneurship, granting banking facilities and credits, governmental oversight on water withdrawals from groundwater sources, development of infrastructures and irrigation and water supply networks, reuse of wastewater, identification and promotion of products compatible with saline and unconventional waters, development of support services and social security for rural communities and development and promotion of drought insurance are proposed in order to reduce the consequences of drought.","[Hosseini, S.

These local supply chains are often highly intertwined and represent a regional supply network for the industry. Individual companies often use supply chain strategies that are sub-optimal to overall supply network performance. To effectively respond to an uncertain business environment, policy-makers and supply chain participants would benefit by a governance framework that would allow to incentivise the formation of supply networks structures enabling effective operations. The purpose of this paper is to offer an empirically grounded conceptual framework based on Complex Adaptive Systems (CASs) governance principles, which links network governance mechanisms with supply network structure and operational performance to incentivise the formation of adaptive and resilient supply networks in the mining industry. Design/methodology/approach - A mixed method research design and a case study of the South Australian mining sector were used to collect empirical data. Qualitative interviews and network analysis of the SA mining industry regional supply network structure were conducted. The relationships between network parameters were interpreted using CAS theory. Findings - An empirically grounded conceptual framework based on CAS governance principles is developed. The case study revealed that supply chain strategies and governance mechanisms in the SA mining industry have led to the formation of a hierarchical, scale-free structure with insufficient horizontal connectivity which limits the adaptability, responsiveness and resilience of the regional supply network. Research limitations/implications - The findings are drawn from a single case study. This limits generalisability of the findings and the proposed framework. Practical implications - The proposed framework draws the attention of the policy-makers and supply chain participants towards the need for utilising CAS governance principles to facilitate the formation of adaptive, responsive and resilient regional supply networks in the mining industry. Originality value - The proposed conceptual framework is an attempt to parameterise the governance of the regional supply networks in the mining industry.","[Statsenko, Larissa; Gorod, Alex; Ireland, Vernon] Univ Adelaide, Fac Profess, Entrepreneurship Commercialisat & Innovat Ctr, Adelaide, SA, Australia","Statsenko, L (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Fac Profess, Entrepreneurship Commercialisat & Innovat Ctr, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",larissa.statsenko@adelaide.edu.au,"statsenko, larissa/AAB-5719-2019","statsenko, larissa/0000-0002-2671-3936",,,,49,3,3,6,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2398-5364,,,J GLOB OPER STRATEG,J.

The purpose of this research is to analyze the key factors on the coordinated development between metropolitan economy and logistics. This paper uses a Bayesian Network to examine their impacts. Several contributions are significant. Firstly, it is observed that the coordinated development of metropolitan economy and logistics heavily relies on their development levels as their posterior probability values are both over 80%. Secondly, two causation chains greatly affected the coordinated development are found. Scientific value of this research is that special attentions should be paid to key factors like logistics infrastructure investment, the development level of logistics industry, basic research and development level, and the technological development level within the chains when carrying out sustainable decision-makings.

It is, however, an emotive subject whereby the extent, accuracy and resolution of available data on postharvest loss and waste are questionable, such that key performance indicators on waste can be misinformed. The nature and extent of food waste differ among developed economies, economies in transition and developing countries. While most emphasis has been put on increasing future crop production, far less resource has been and is still channelled towards enabling both established and innovative food preservation technologies to reduce food waste while maintaining safety and quality. Reducing food loss and waste is a more tractable problem than increasing production in the short to medium term, as its solution is not directly limited, for instance, by available land and water resources. Here we argue the need for a paradigm shift of current funding strategies and research programmes that will encourage the development, implementation and translation of collective biological, engineering and management solutions to better preserve and utilise food. Such multidisciplinary thinking across global supply chains is an essential element in the pursuit of achieving sustainable food and nutritional security. The implementation of allied technological and management solutions is reliant on there being sufficient skilled human capital and resources. There is currently a lack of robust postharvest research networks outside of the developed world, and insufficient global funding mechanisms that can support such interdisciplinary collaborations. There is, thus, a collective need for schemes that encourage inter-supply chain research, knowledge exchange and capacity building to reduce food losses and waste.

Nowadays, environmental pollution is another critical factor in designing the petroleum supply chain. This importance encourages the governments to minimize the amount of environmental pollution and maximize their obtained profit simultaneously, by enacting required legislations on the transportation modes and the refineries. Considering maximizing the job creation and each stakeholder's profit, and minimizing the emission of CO2 and other greenhouse gases at the same time is called Sustainable Petroleum Supply Chain which has been paid little attention despite its significance. Therefore, the modelling of petroleum supply chain considering sustainability and pricing issues is investigated for the first time in this work and a sustainable competitive petroleum supply chain (SCPSC) model is developed to minimize pollution while maximizing the profits and job creation. This problem is a two level model. The first level in SCPSC is the competition between the supply chains of the government and the private sectors, which is modelled by the game theory approach including Nash and Stackelberg equilibria. The optimal price and demand for each supply chain determined in the first level are considered as the second level parameters. In the second level, the optimal values of the decisions in designing the petroleum supply chain will be obtained by solving Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) under the mentioned three objective functions. Finally, the proposed model is applied to a real world case in the national Iranian oil company (NIOC). Based on the results of the Stackelberg equilibrium, the government profits increase by 11.12% while that of the private sector decreases by 25.4 and 28.11%. Increasing in the government profit is due to increased demand provided by government.

The study presents a small farmers' cross-cultural analysis - two Italian and two Brazilian milk and dairy producers - that shortened their Food Supply Chain (FSC) to get closer to the consumers and to deliver products with high quality and traceability, and at the same time increase profits. The reduction of distances and the elimination of intermediaries, solely, may increase production earnings in the SFSC, but it does not assure a long-term position in food markets. Success factors for SFSC were identified and retrieved from the literature and presented to three Italian and three Brazilian experts in FSC for analyzing each case. It was found that producers had cultural difficulties for SFSC model adoption, but economic reasons as cutting costs of transportation and elimination of intermediary agents justified their initiatives. However, consolidation of SFSC implementation still requires environmental protection efforts linked to better production processes in small farms, and health safeguards for consumers, as well as the preservation of the cultural heritage associated with the region of origin of the production.

A number of efforts have been devoted to define SCRR or to develop risk mitigation strategies for their improvement. However, a key question remaining to be answered is how SCRR should be quantified. Existing methods are insufficient in addressing this question on two important fronts: First, they do not adequately represent the interdependencies between different supply chain nodes; second, they do not allow for the modeling of actionable decisions and thus cannot be used to guide improvement strategies. This paper aims to fill this gap by proposing a unified framework for evaluating SCRR that internalizes design inputs and is flexible to varying degrees of data availability. The proposed framework captures risks involved in the supply, the demand, the firm itself, and the external environment. It also contributes to the literature by relating SCRR to the supply chain's risk-mitigating capabilities prior to or postdisruptions. A novel method using the supply chain's inherent buyer-supplier relationships is designed to model node interdependencies. Two example applications are discussed to demonstrate how this framework can be utilized to assist in reliable and resilient supply chain design.","[Chen, Xi; Jing, Pengyuan] Univ Michigan, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Dearborn, MI 48128 USA; [Xi, Zhimin] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Chen, X (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Dearborn, MI 48128 USA.",xichenxi@umich.edu; zxi1@utk.edu; pjing@umich.edu,,,Faculty Research Initiation at the University of Michigan-Dearborn; Seed Grant at the University of Michigan-Dearborn,This work was supported by a Faculty Research Initiation and Seed Grant at the University of Michigan-Dearborn.

However, occurrence of disruptions such as flood, earthquake and fire could ruin performance of supply chains. Uncertainty of parameters is another important factor that could lower quality of long-term plans of companies. Hence, uncertainty of parameters and disruption strike are important issues adversely influencing reliability of networks. Also, responsiveness of supply chains is a significant matter that should be considered carefully while designing distribution networks. Responsiveness could increase customer loyalty and satisfaction that could result in increasing market share of companies and their long-term planned benefit. Regarding alluded matters, the aim of this paper is designing a reliable forward reverse supply chain network that minimizes total costs of network design along with maximization of total responsiveness of distribution network. Extended closed-loop network is capable of considering environmental issues by caring about end-of-life products. Designing reverse supply chain network aside with forward ones could decrease bad environmental impact of end-of-life products. Notably, to cope with adverse effects of disruptions, a scenario-based approach is suggested that enables considering partial and complete disruption of capacity of facilities. Additionally, an effective possibilistic programming method is applied to appropriately control uncertainty of parameters. As quality of raw materials is important to produce high-quality products, minimum acceptable quality level of raw materials is considered in extended model to maximize customer satisfaction. Finally, it should be noted that designed test problems show appropriate performance of suggested model and its applicability in real world case studies. Extended model is solved regarding different risk-aversion levels and sensitivity analysis is performed for different parameters of network design that shows effectual performance of proposed model.","[Hamidieh, Alireza] Payame Noor Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Fazli-Khalaf, Mohamadreza] Kharazmi Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran","Hamidieh, A (corresponding author), Payame Noor Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran.",hamidieh@tpnu.ac.ir; mohamad.fazli@yahoo.com,,,,,,44,4,3,2,30,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0219-6867,1793-6896,,J ADV MANUF SYST,J.

In contrast to the proposed negative association in Clement (1999) owing to the portfolio complexity effect, we hypothesize an economy-of-scale effect' that is likely to dominate when analysts rely mostly on public information. In support of the latter effect, we find a positive association between firm coverage and forecast accuracy after the enactment of Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD), which substantially reduces the flow of material private information to analysts. Such a result survives a battery of robustness analyses. We further show that, in the post-Reg FD period, covering more firms increases an analyst's probability of being selected as a star analyst in the subsequent year.

In this process, the aforementioned dimensions are extended and integrated in mathematical modeling framework. The research modeling is compared with traditional approaches, which merely rely on operational dimension to optimize profit and due to problems in profit, the research objectives changed to the multiple objectives of corporate value, change in equity and economic value added. Within this framework, a comparison is primarily made between profit and each of corporate value, change in equity and economic value added two by two (in the form of traditional approach (scenario A) and new approach (scenario B)). Then the objectives are simultaneously assessed and a compromise is gained among them through fuzzy goal programming. In this process, the effectiveness and efficiency of the scenario B is analyzed and assessed. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is performed on such factors as demand, return of equity rate, tax rate, production capacity and supplier capacity while the impacts of their changes on multi-objective function and satisfaction coefficient are simultaneously calculated. The mathematical model in the study is multi-product and multi-period while the values of parameters are determined under definite circumstances. For modeling and solving the mathematical model, GAMS 24 software and CPLEX solver are employed. To test the model, data of an Iranian petrochemical company are used. Besides highlighting the significance of the financial dimension and its integration with the operational dimension in gaining sustainable competitive advantage, the research results revealed that CVM- in contrast to change in equity and EVA- is much more favorable than the other objectives. Similarly, changes in demand had more favorable effects on multi-objective analysis.","[Mohammadi, Ali; Abbasi, Abbas; Alimohammadlou, Moslem; Khalifeh, Mojtaba] Shiraz Univ, Management Dept, Shiraz, Iran; [Eghtesadifard, Mahmood] Shiraz Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Shiraz, Iran","Khalifeh, M (corresponding author), Shiraz Univ, Management Dept, Shiraz, Iran.",Amohamadi1347@shirazu.ac.ir; Aabbasi@shirazu.ac.ir; Mslmaml@shirazu.ac.ir; Eghtesadifard@sutech.ac.ir; M_khalifeh@shirazu.ac.ir,"Mohammadi, Ali/W-7614-2018; Alimohammadlou, Moslem/W-8859-2018; Mohammadi, Ali/W-7622-2018; alimohammadlou, moslem/R-7854-2019","Mohammadi, Ali/0000-0001-9898-704X; Alimohammadlou, Moslem/0000-0002-3770-9115; Mohammadi, Ali/0000-0001-9898-704X; alimohammadlou, moslem/0000-0002-9463-7285; Abbasi, Abbas/0000-0002-1325-9199; khalifeh, mojtaba/0000-0001-6694-5670",,,,82,4,4,3,28,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-8352,1879-0550,,COMPUT IND ENG,Comput.

While considerable research has examined the risk of disturbance in global energy markets resulting from a disruption to physical chokepoints along major trade routes, no comparable analysis has been undertaken for agricultural commodities. Here we present the Chatham House Maritime Analysis Tool (CH-MAT), which estimates the volume and value of staple foods passing through maritime chokepoints. The CH-MAT permits analysis of flows through chokepoints arising from bilateral trade in commodities over the period 2000 to 2015. The value of the CH-MAT is illustrated by a first assessment of global flows via maritime chokepoints. We discuss how such data can be combined with information on inland and overland transport networks, strategic reserves and environmental change, to enhance understanding of the risks associated with disruption to critical infrastructure - owing to weather events, trade restrictions, conflict, congestion, or institutional failures.

Nowadays, design decisions should be viable enough to function well under complex and uncertain business environments for many years or decades. Therefore, it is essential to make these decisions in the presence of uncertainty, as over the last two decades, a large number of relevant publications have emphasized its importance. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of studies in the fields of SCND and reverse logistics network design under uncertainty. The paper is organized in two main parts to investigate the basic features of these studies. In the first part, planning decisions, network structure, paradigms and aspects related to SCM are discussed. In the second part, existing optimization techniques for dealing with uncertainty such as recourse-based stochastic programming, risk-averse stochastic programming, robust optimization, and fuzzy mathematical programming are explored in terms of mathematical modeling and solution approaches. Finally, the drawbacks and missing aspects of the related literature are highlighted and a list of potential issues for future research directions is recommended. (C) 2017 The Authors.

A mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to optimize the paper and cardboard recycling network, and a robust optimization approach is utilized to deal with demand uncertainty in this network. The model maximizes the total profit. It considers the operation, transportation, purchasing and holding inventory costs as well. Moreover, to illustrate the application of the proposed model, a real-world cardboard closed-loop supply chain design is investigated. The proposed model considers the option to open a new recycling center in the current network. The proposed model determines the optimal quantities of the waste paper, paper, sheet and cardboard that flow in this network.

The improvement solutions are presented for all efficient and inefficient units based on experts' requirements. Therefore, the goals are considered as fuzzy values. To deal with uncertainty, a suitable fuzzy possibilistic approach is employed. Given robust optimization approach, the units of the supply chain are ranked based on penalties of deviations from goals as feasibility robustness and also the average and standard deviation of deviations as optimality robustness. One advantage of the proposed model is that it can determine balancing values and improvement solutions for flows among the units of a supply chain which have dual-roles factors so that the deviations from their goals are minimized. The proposed robust network GP-DEA model is run in a case study. The outcome of this paper can be used to evaluate and rank all types of supply chains with different network structures.

By considering returns' quality, this study is to optimize the buffer allocation with maximum throughput rate and minimum work in process (WIP) concurrently. Decomposition-extension-Markov approach is adopted to establish the model and obtain the performance of the system. A novel tabu search non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (TS-NSGA II) is put forward to search the optimal solution, and the Pareto-optimal solutions are obtained. A case study is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The main findings of the study are as follows: (1) Compared with the previous studies, a Pareto optimization can maintain the diversity of the solutions, thus it is favorable to make better decisions for multi-objective buffer allocation. (2) TS-NSGA II can obtain optimal solutions closely enough to the Pareto frontier, and it has significant advantages in convergence, diversity and running time. (3) Buffer capacity and its allocation have important effect on the performance of remanufacturing system. For WIP, the buffer capacity is the most critical influence factor; for the throughput ratio and discarded ratio, buffer capacity is the secondary factor just behind the process route. The above achievements provide an valuable reference for the optimal design of remanufacturing system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Because used tires are not biodegradable, there is strong motivation to successfully manage this fast-growing waste flow. One of the most popular approaches for sustainable environmental stewardship of used tires is retreading. The problem investigated in this paper is to identify optimized purchasing, retreading, and inventory planning schemes of used tires in multiple tire retreading plants as well as allocation patterns of retreaded, reusable, and end-of-life tires that secure maximized profit within a multi-period planning horizon and under multiple uncertainties. This paper proposes an interval-parameter semi-infinite programming model for used tire management and planning. The underlying difference between this model and those developed in previous research is its ability to consider the effects of external impact factors related to complicated economic, environmental, and social activities on used tire management systems. Moreover, it can successfully handle real-life uncertainties of the used tire management systems expressed as functional and crisp intervals. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the developed model. Flexible long-term purchasing, retreading, inventory, and allocation plans, which are adjustable with variations of external impact factors, are obtained. The presented model has advantages in addressing the dynamic complexity of used tire management systems by introducing the functional interval parameters associated with the price of a new tire as well as electricity and gas prices and labor costs in waste management and transportation sectors. Compared with the available models, the resulting solutions are far more robust because they are able to satisfy all possible levels of external impact factors. The presented model is beneficial for the tire retreading industry, which processes millions of used tires annually. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

These so-called centralised urban water systems are further maladapted to upcoming challenges because of their long lifespan in combination with their short-sighted planning and design. A combination of (existing) centralised and decentralised infrastructure is expected to be more reliable and sustainable. However, the impact of increasing implementation of decentralised technologies on the local technical performance in sewer or water supply networks and the interaction with the urban form has rarely been addressed in the literature. In this work, an approach which couples the UrbanBEATS model for the planning of decentralised strategies together with a water supply modelling approach is developed and applied to a demonstration case. With this novel approach, critical but also favourable areas for such implementations can be identified. For example, low density areas, which have high potential for rainwater harvesting, can result in local water quality problems in the supply network when further reducing usually low pipe velocities in these areas. On the contrary, in high demand areas (e.g., high density urban forms) there is less effect of rainwater harvesting due to the limited available space. In these high density areas, water efficiency measures result in the highest savings in water volume, but do not cause significant problems in the technical performance of the potable water supply network. For a more generalised and case-independent conclusion, further analyses are performed for semi-virtual benchmark networks to answer the question of an appropriate representation of the water distribution system in a computational model for such an analysis. Inappropriate hydraulic model assumptions and characteristics were identified for the stated problem, which have more impact on the assessments than the decentralised measures.","[Sitzenfrei, Robert; Zischg, Jonatan; Sitzmann, Markus] Univ Innsbruck, Unit Environm Engn, Technikerstr 13, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Bach, Peter M.] Monash Univ, Monash Infrastruct Res Inst, Dept Civil Engn, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia","Sitzenfrei, R (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Unit Environm Engn, Technikerstr 13, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",robert.sitzenfrei@uibk.ac.at; jonatan.zischg@uibk.ac.at; markus.sitzmann@uibk.ac.at; peter.bach@monash.edu,"Bach, Peter Marcus/I-4618-2019","Bach, Peter Marcus/0000-0001-5799-6185; Zischg, Jonatan/0000-0002-7506-1073; Sitzenfrei, Robert/0000-0003-1093-6040",Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) [858557]; Monash University's Faculty of Engineering,"This research was funded by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) within the research project ORONET (project number: 858557) and Monash University's Faculty of Engineering SEED Funding Scheme 2015.

In this paper, we consider reliable supply chain design for biomass collection against feedstock seasonality and time-varying disruption risks. We optimize facility location, inventory, biomass quantity, and shipment decisions in a multi-period planning horizon setting. A real-world case in Hubei, China is studied to offer managerial insights. Our computational results show that: (1) the disruption risk significantly affects both the optimal facility locations and the supply chain cost; (2) no matter how the failure probability changes, setting backup facilities can significantly decrease the total cost; and (3) the feedstock seasonality does not affect locations of the collection facilities, but it affects the allocations of collection facilities and brings higher inventory cost for the biomass supply chain.","[Liu, Zhixue; Wang, Shukun] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 403374, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Ouyang, Yanfeng] Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Wang, SK (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 403374, Hubei, Peoples R China.",lsy868@hust.edu.cn; wsk17951@163.com; yfouyang@illinois.edu,,,"National Natural Sciences Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [NSFC71372134]; U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CMMI-1234085, CMMI-1662825]","We thank Hubei NE Biofuel Company for providing us data for our case study.

The concept of urban industrial symbiosis offers a smart solution for city to coordinate the relationship among industries and between industry and city. While internationally, this idea has been promoted more than two decades, in China, which is ideal laboratory to test such practices, related research is rather few, especially quantitative studies. With this circumstance, this study conducts a case study to test the urban industrial symbiosis promotion in one typical industrial city named Liuzhou, in southern China, of which heavy industries play an important role. A hybrid evaluation model integrating process based life cycle assessment (LCA) and input-output (IO) model is established to assess the environmental benefits in the whole supply chain. Based on local conditions, innovative urban industrial symbiosis is designed and analyzed. Five new waste/energy synergies named waste plastics recycling, scrap tire recycling, coal flying ash recycling, biomass utilization and carbon capture by slag carbonization are selected for scenarios analysis. We particular focus on the carbon mitigations. Compared with business as usual scenario, planned symbiosis enables to reduce CO2 emissions by 29.66, 557.42 and 520.13 kt-CO2/year in power purchase, material consumption and waste disposal stage. Results highlight that urban industrial symbiosis is not only able to green the industries, but also utilize industry contribute to urban development. Finally, policy implications and countermeasures to address the barriers of promoting the urban industrial symbiosis are discussed.

In recent years, increasing concern about the financial loss and environmental pollution caused by leaking pipes has been driving the development of efficient algorithms for detecting leakage in water piping networks. Water distribution networks (WDNs) are disperse in nature with numerous number of nodes and branches. Consequently, identifying the segment(s) of the network and the exact leaking pipelines connected to this segment(s) where higher background leakage outflow occurs is a challenging task. Background leakage concerns the outflow from small cracks or deteriorated joints. In addition, because they are diffuse flow, they are not characterised by quick pressure drop and are not detectable by measuring instruments. Consequently, they go unreported for a long period of time posing a threat to water loss volume. Most of the existing research focuses on the detection and localisation of burst type leakages which are characterised by a sudden pressure drop. In this work, an algorithm for detecting and estimating background leakage in water distribution networks is presented. The algorithm integrates a leakage model into a classical WDN hydraulic model for solving the network leakage flows. The applicability of the developed algorithm is demonstrated on two different water networks. The results of the tested networks are discussed and the solutions obtained show the benefits of the proposed algorithm. A noteworthy evidence is that the algorithm permits the detection of critical segments or pipes of the network experiencing higher leakage outflow and indicates the probable pipes of the network where pressure control can be performed. However, the possible position of pressure control elements along such critical pipes will be addressed in future work.","[Adedeji, Kazeem B.; Hamam, Yskandar; Abe, Bolanle T.; Abu-Mahfouz, Adnan M.] Tshwane Univ Technol, Dept Elect Engn, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; [Abu-Mahfouz, Adnan M.] Meraka Inst, Council Sci & Ind Res, ZA-0184 Pretoria, South Africa","Adedeji, KB (corresponding author), Tshwane Univ Technol, Dept Elect Engn, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",adedejikb@tut.ac.za; hamama@tut.ac.za; abebt@tut.ac.za; a.abumahfouz@ieee.org,"Abu-Mahfouz, Adnan M./S-2253-2017; Abe, Bolanle/AAC-7350-2021","Abu-Mahfouz, Adnan M./0000-0002-6413-3924; Abe, Bolanle/0000-0001-9216-1992","Tshwane University of Technology, Pretoria; Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Pretoria, South Africa","This research work was supported in part by the Tshwane University of Technology, Pretoria and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Pretoria, South Africa.",,72,24,24,1,29,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,OCT,2017,9,10,,,,,,,773,10.3390/w9100773,,,21,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,FM1BZ,WOS:000414707500050,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

Therefore, current study is aimed to determine an optimal closed loop supply chain network, which is composed of multiple producers, remanufacturers, intermediate centers and customer centers. Furthermore, uncertainty in the demand and uncertainty in the quantity of returned products is considered simultaneously in the network to make it significantly useful in the uncertain environment. A novel genetic artificial bee colony (GABC) algorithm is introduced with a new food source representation for the current problem. The proposed GABC algorithm considered neighbor food sources for local search and used crossover and mutation operations of genetic algorithm to enhance the exploration ability of the proposed algorithm. Taguchi method is employed to compute the optimal parameters of GABC for two different size test problems taken from literature and a Case problem which are modified according to the current research problem. The performance of presented GABC algorithm is tested by comparing the results of considered test problems with the results obtained from the original artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA). Moreover, to test the robustness of the proposed GABC algorithm, different scenarios of small and large size problems based on the quantity of demand and variations in demand are made to perform the experiments. Results indicate that proposed GABC outperforms standard ABC and GA in different scenarios to give smaller value of the total cost of network and gives more robust results to give smaller variations in the total cost of network due to uncertain variations in the demand, as compared to original ABC and GA.d (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, this article extends the Geopolitical Supply Risk methodology by proposing a characterization model to quantify product supply risk in relation to a functional unit under the Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment framework. The characterization model is based on a socio-economic cause-effect mechanism drawing upon supply chain resilience concepts. Supply risk - or criticality - of a given intermediate product is defined as the multiple of probability of supply disruption and vulnerability to supply disruption. Two embodiments of the characterization model are proposed, each supplementing the previously developed probability indicators with different indicators for vulnerability. They are demonstrated with a comparative case study of an electric vehicle and internal combustion engine vehicle. The results are highly sensitive to how vulnerability is measured, and a number of methodological complications arise. The most promising embodiment of the characterization model cancels out the amounts of commodity inputs, as it can be strongly argued that every input to the product system is equally important for product performance as expressed by the functional unit. Thus, the Geopolitical Supply Risk characterization model shows the importance of integrating raw material criticality considerations into Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment to better inform management decisions at a product level.

The devastating effects, caused by disasters on economies in various countries such as United States of America, Japan, Kenya, Uganda, Mozambique and Zimbabwe call for urgent sustainable mitigating measures in disaster risk reduction. These countries have experienced notable natural and man-made disasters in the past. The disasters negatively impacted the economies of both developed and developing countries, causing misery to people as hunger and poverty drastically increased. Zimbabwe's dairy industry was not spared from these devastating effects as it was vulnerable to disasters such as droughts and cyclones. Disasters adversely affected supply chains in the country as evidenced by the closure of some dairy firms between the years 2000 and 2014. This article is set against the backdrop of declining output across all agricultural sectors in Zimbabwe, evident particularly in the dairy farming sector which has witnessed inadequate supply of raw milk and dairy products by local producers. The article assesses the impact of dairy organisations' partnerships with government departments and non-governmental organisations in reducing disaster risks on the dairy supply chain cost efficiency. It also aims to show how partnerships can reduce disaster risks and weighs the benefits of reduced supply chain costs in improving the affordability of milk and milk products to the general public. The study employs a mixed-methods approach comprising structured questionnaires, administered to a sample of 92 respondents out of a randomly sampled population of 122 participants from dairy farming clusters across the country, with an 85% response rate. Key informants in the form of 18 dairy officers were purposively sampled for interviews throughout the dairy farming regions. The research findings will help government in the formulation of public policies for the dairy sector network in reducing disaster risks.","[Chari, Felix; Ngcamu, Bethuel S.] Durban Univ Technol, Dept Publ Management & Econ, Durban, South Africa","Ngcamu, BS (corresponding author), Durban Univ Technol, Dept Publ Management & Econ, Durban, South Africa.",ngcamub@cput.ac.za,,,,,,56,1,1,0,5,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",1817-4434,2415-2005,,TD-J TRANSDISCIPL RE,TD-J.

A dynamic model of the supply network is established, in which each node is represented as a Lorenz system. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, an impulsive pinning controller is designed for resilient recovery. Numerical simulations and related case study are used to verify the validity of the proposed model and the resilient recovery method.

Due to an increasing global population, society faces a greater challenge for sustainable food production, quality, distribution, and food safety in the food supply chain. Adopting green supply chain management (GSCM) elements is essential for utilizing the food supply chain in an environmentally benign way. As a solution to the above challenge, the economic and green characteristics for supplier selection in green purchasing are studied in this paper. For an organization, the evaluation and selection of the green supplier is a vital issue due to several tangible and intangible criteria involved. Accordingly, we apply multiple criteria decision aiding techniques. We propose a hybrid approach that combines the revised Simos procedure, PROMETHEE methods, algorithms for constructing a group compromise ranking, and robustness analysis. At first, the revised Simos procedure is used to derive the criteria weights. Next, the PROMETHEE method is applied to rank the suppliers according to each Decision Maker's (DM's) preferences. Then, the compromise ranking is constructed to minimize the distance of the individual's rankings from the solution adopted by the whole group. For this purpose, we introduce and apply some original procedures based on Binary Linear Programming. Finally, the results are validated against the outcomes of robustness analysis. The applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach is endorsed with a case study in an Indian food industry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Typically, Original Equipment Manufacturer-centric supply chain perspectives neglect the complexity at the End-Of-Life where many third-parties are involved in reuse and recycling activities. Based on a review of product lifecycle and related recycling literature, this study proposes the application of 'cascades', a term originally coined within the biomass domain. We propose and subsequently apply the 'cascade use methodology' and identify additional and value-adding End-Of-Life solutions for products and materials. The adoption of cascade utilization into product lifecycles is analyzed and critically discussed using case studies from independent remanufacturing and tire recycling, focusing on the End-Of-Life while excluding business models as renting or sharing.

The sustainability of IBS compared to stand-alone biomass processing facilities is achieved through integration of process units or component plants via their bioenergy products, by-products, wastes, and common utilities. However, such increased component interdependency makes the resulting integrated energy system vulnerable to capacity disruptions. IBS in particular are vulnerable to climate change-induced events (e.g., drought) that reduce the availability of biomass feedstocks in bioenergy production. Cascading failure due to such supply-side disruptive event is an inherent risk in IBS and may pose a barrier to the commercial-scale adoption of such systems. A previous study developed a risk-based criticality index to quantify the effect of a component's disruption within integrated energy systems. This index is used to rank the component's relative risk in the network based on the ripple effects of its disruption. In this work, a novel P-graph approach is proposed as an alternative methodology for criticality analysis of component units or plants in an IBS. This risk-based metric can be used for developing risk management polices to protect critical facilities, thereby increasing the robustness of IBS against disruptions. Two case studies on determining the criticality index of process units in an integrated biorefinery and component plants in a bioenergy park are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.","[Benjamin, Michael Francis D.] Univ Santo Tomas, Res Ctr Nat & Appl Sci, Espana Blvd, Manila 1015, Philippines; [Cayamanda, Christina D.; Tan, Raymond R.; Razon, Luis F.] De La Salle Univ, Dept Chem Engn, 2401 Taft Ave, Manila 0922, Philippines","Benjamin, MFD (corresponding author), Univ Santo Tomas, Res Ctr Nat & Appl Sci, Espana Blvd, Manila 1015, Philippines.",mdbenjamin@ust.edu.ph,"Benjamin, Michael Francis/AAF-9386-2020","Benjamin, Michael Francis/0000-0002-6189-1666","Philippine Commission on Higher Education (CHED) via Support for Paper Presentations in International Conferences (SPPIC) programCommission on Higher Education (CHED), Philippines",M.

Implementing green innovations represents a great challenge for non-green companies because it often requires the acquisition of new resources and competences that differ significantly from their existing competences. This paper attempts to propose a theoretical framework that classifies green innovations according their impact on company's competences and analyses how green innovations can be implemented. Given the complexity of the issue and the variability of situations, we use a multiple case study analysis of several green innovations developed in a non-green industry, namely the automotive sector. Indeed, this is one that produces the highest environmental impact and, in recent years, it has been subjected to increasing regulatory restrictions. Companies operating in a non-green industry that implement disruptive, radical and architectural green innovations can initiate market and technological partnerships to mitigate against such internal weaknesses, such as the lack of technological capabilities and market knowledge. The collaboration helps firms to access new competences and capabilities useful to change or develop new technology capabilities and market knowledge more easily and with lower costs.","[Calza, Francesco; Parmentola, Adele; Tutore, Ilaria] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dipartimento Studi Aziendali & Quantitat, I-80132 Naples, Italy","Tutore, I (corresponding author), Univ Naples Parthenope, Dipartimento Studi Aziendali & Quantitat, I-80132 Naples, Italy.",francesco.calza@uniparthenope.it; adele.parmentola@uniparthenope.it; ilaria.tutore@uniparthenope.it,"Tutore, Ilaria/AAL-3840-2020","Tutore, Ilaria/0000-0002-3520-1449; parmentola, adele/0000-0002-2715-2544",,,,52,20,21,0,31,MDPI AG,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2017,9,8,,,,,,,1301,10.3390/su9081301,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FF3YT,WOS:000408861800016,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

Using transaction cost theory (TCT), we specify the economic and behavioural issues raised by strategic CSR policies. We show that the existence of market rewards for such policies does not constitute a solution per se, but tends to increase the difficulties that value chain members face. Bringing TCT into the analysis of the diffusion of strategic CSR policies in GVCs helps us to make different contributions. We first theoretically identify some limiting conditions of strategic CSR policies in GVCs. We also contribute to developing a more robust theoretical perspective for CSR in GVC research, which remains underdeveloped and mostly driven by empirical case studies. Finally, we shed light on new research questions and topics that could guide major theoretical and empirical investigations in the capacity of GVCs members to bypass the numerous difficulties involved in the implementation of strategic CSR policies.","[Acquier, Aurelien] ESCP Europe, Paris, France; [Valiorgue, Bertrand] Ecole Univ Management, CRCGM, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Daudigeos, Thibault] Grenoble Ecole Management, Grenoble, France","Valiorgue, B (corresponding author), Ecole Univ Management, CRCGM, Clermont Ferrand, France.",aacquier@escpeurope.eu; bertrand.valiorgue@udamail.fr; thibault.daudigeos@grenoble-em.com,,,,,,107,19,19,4,73,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4544,1573-0697,,J BUS ETHICS,J.

Vast majority of existing studies paid close attention to the design of nodes in terms of economic and environmental improvements. By contrast, the optimization of core industrial chain is largely overlooked. A novel methodology is proposed in this study to assist the core ecological industry chain design where resources, economy and environment are set as the constraints. Ecological industry chain efficiency is evaluated by Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) where constraint conditions gradually superimposed into the core ecological industry chain. This methodology is validated through an empirical case study. Results showed that the relative efficiency of the core ecological industry chain consisted of Chlorine Alkali Plant-Alumina Plant-Electrolytic Aluminum Plant-Aluminum Deep Processing Plant is close to 1. This core ecological industry chain achieved the coordinated development among economic, energy and environment. It belongs to the typical value-added design of EIC. The relative efficiency of the core ecological industry chains consisted of Lime Plant-Calcium Carbide Plant Polyvinyl Chloride Plant and Chlorine Alkali Plant- Polyvinyl Chloride Plant-Density Board Plant is 0.8690 and 0.7956, respectively. These core ecological industry chains can be further improved by means of continuous optimization design, i.e., introducing key fill chain links to rearrange the upstream and downstream enterprises. These findings provide useful references for the EIPs development and related policy making. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The production potential, financial returns, and the supply chain implications for irrigated agriculture were assessed in four different regions across northern Australia to provide a systems analysis of development opportunities and challenges. Gross margins for high volume, low value broadacre crops were mostly either negative or weakly positive, principally due to high transport costs to established markets in southern and eastern Australia. The returns were largely positive for higher value horticultural and specialist niche crops or industrial crops with local processing facilities. Scenarios incorporating alternative transport routes to Asia provided modest cost savings, but required assumptions for suitable shipping routes and cost-effective availability of containers, but did not significantly boost gross margins. When scaled to whole irrigation areas, the regional gross value of production could be significant but improving returns at farm scale requires more cost-effective supply chains. The ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investment was strongly influenced by the sequence of years associated with climatic variability and/or other unexpected shocks experienced in the years immediately following investment. The analysis highlighted that each component of the system climate, soils, water, agronomic practice, pests and diseases, farm operations, management, planning, supply chains, infrastructure, labour, services, markets needs to be understood but ultimate success will depend on managing the complexity of the whole fanning system and value-chain. Further, scaling up development at a considered pace and being prepared for considerable lags before positive returns on investment are achieved will be critical for successful long-term irrigated agricultural ventures in northern Australia.","[Ash, Andrew; Hopwood, Garry; MacLeod, Neil; Poulton, Perry; Di Prestwidge; Webster, Tony] CSIRO Agr & Food, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Gleeson, Trish] Australian Bur Agr & Resource Econ & Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Hall, Murray; Higgins, Andrew; Wilson, Peter] CSIRO Land & Water, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Hall, Murray] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Paini, Dean] CSIRO Hlth & Biosecur, Clayton, Vic, Australia","Ash, A (corresponding author), CSIRO Agr & Food, Clayton, Vic, Australia.",andrew.ash@csiro.au,"Webster, Anthony/G-2072-2010; Ash, Andrew J/D-5237-2012; Poulton, Perry L/D-7027-2011; Paini, Dean/C-2341-2009; Higgins, A J/B-5951-2011","Poulton, Perry L/0000-0003-1341-5056; Ash, Andrew/0000-0001-9156-6664; Webster, Anthony/0000-0002-6899-3067","Office of Northern Australia, Commonwealth Government of Australia","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by the Office of Northern Australia, Commonwealth Government of Australia, to undertake the Food and Fibre Supply Chain Study, which provided the data and analysis underpinning this research paper.",,40,9,9,0,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-521X,1873-2267,,AGR SYST,Agric.

One common key issue regarding CLN resource combination is the network design optimization problem under discrete uncertainty (DU-CLNDOP). Operational environment changes and information uncertainty in network designs, due to partner selection, resource constrains and network robustness, must be effectively controlled from the system perspective. Therefore, a general two-stage quantitative framework that enables decision makers to select the optimal network design scheme for CLNs under uncertainty is proposed in this paper. Phase 1 calculates the simulation result of each hypothetical scenario of CLN resource combination using the expected value model with robust constraints. Phase 2 selects the optimal network design scheme for DU-CLNDOP using the orthogonal experiment design method. The validity of the model and method are verified via an illustrative example.

Such recycling system has the benefits of reducing environmental pollution, boosting the economy by creating new jobs, and generating income from trading the recyclable materials. This leads to the formation of a global reverse supply chain (GRSC) of solid waste. In this paper, we investigate the design of such a GRSC with a special emphasis on three aspects; (1) uncertainty of waste collection levels, (2) associated carbon emissions, and (3) challenges posed by the supply chain's global aspect, particularly the maritime transportation costs and currency exchange rates. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to integrate the three above mentioned important aspects in the design of a GRSC. We have used mixed integer-linear programming method along with robust optimization to develop the model which is validated using a sample case study of e-waste management. Our results show that using a robust model by taking the complex interactions characterizing global reverse supply chain networks into account, we can create a better GRSC. The effect of uncertainties and carbon constraints on decisions to reduce costs and emissions are also shown. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

They bring benefits from industrial plants to industrial parks and neighborhood areas. The exchange of materials, water, and energy is the goal of IS to reduce wastes, by-products, and energy consumption among a cluster of industries. However, although the IS design looks for the best set of flow exchanges among industries at a network level, the lack of access to accurate data challenges the optimal design of a new EIP. IS solutions face uncertainties. Considering the huge cost and long establishment time of IS, the existing studies cannot provide a robust model to investigate effects of uncertainty on the optimal symbioses design. This paper introduces a framework to investigate uncertainties in the EIP design. A multi-objective model is proposed to decide the optimal network of symbiotic exchanges among firms. The model minimizes the costs of multiple product exchanges and environmental impacts of flow exchanges. Moreover, this paper integrates the analysis of uncertainties effects on synergies into the modeling process. The presented models are depicted through optimizing energy synergies of an industrial zone in France. The efficiency of single and multiple objective models is analyzed for the effects of the identified uncertainties. In addition, the presented deterministic and robust models are compared to investigate how the uncertainties affect the performance and configuration of an optimal network. It is believed that the models could improve an EIP's resilience under uncertainties.","[Afshari, Hamid; Peng, Qingjin] Univ Manitoba, Dept Mech Engn, EITC, 75A Chancellors Circle, Winnipeg, MB R3T 5V6, Canada; [Farel, Romain] PS2E Res & Educ Inst, F-78354 Les Loges En Josas, France","Peng, QJ (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Dept Mech Engn, EITC, 75A Chancellors Circle, Winnipeg, MB R3T 5V6, Canada.",afsharih@myumanitoba.ca; Romain.Farel@institut-ps2e.com; Qingjin.Peng@Umanitoba.ca,"Afshari, Hamid/M-4120-2019","Afshari, Hamid/0000-0003-3546-5556","UMGF Grant from the University of Manitoba; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [RGPIN-2015-04173]; GLOBALINK, Mitacs Canada; Campus France","The authors wish to acknowledge that this research has been supported by UMGF Grant from the University of Manitoba, Discovery Grant No. (RGPIN-2015-04173) from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada, and GLOBALINK research award from the Mitacs Canada and Campus France.",,66,8,8,0,10,ASME,NEW YORK,"TWO PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",2332-9017,2332-9025,,ASCE-ASME J RISK UNC,ASCE-ASME J.

This unique inventory-location problem involves demand and supply uncertainties, coverage radius limitations, service level requirements, and multiple products consideration. Each retailer has two classes of products flowing from the assigned DC due to demands minus donations occurring in that retailer. The proposed model simultaneously determines the number of DCs to open, DC locations, and assignments of retailers to the open DCs for particular product types. The objective is to minimize the total annual cost including: facility location costs, transportation costs, inventory costs, and the lost sale costs. Due to the complexity of the problem, the proposed model structure allows for relaxing complicating constraints through recourse to Lagrangian relaxation. The use of robust branch-cut and price heuristics solves the mixed integer nonlinear problem to obtain a lower bound and a distance-based heuristic to get an upper bound. We formulate essential features of this novel problem, solve several numerical example problems and evaluate solution performance. We believe this is a novel problem environment, and that this initial study extends integrated location-inventory modeling to a new context. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The model is based on a robust possibilistic programming approach. The proposed models not only minimize the total costs but also develop an effective resistant network under disruptions strikes and control the product delivery speed at appropriate safety levels.

Supplier selection is strategically important as it can determine the organization's success in achieving goals of adopting green practices. Realizing the importance of supplier selection, this study aims at selecting suppliers among SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) on the basis of their green innovation ability. A three phase methodology is used for presenting a framework for supplier selection by large organizations, the first phase involves the selection of criteria of green innovation through literature review and interviews with decision makers, the second phase involves ranking of selection criteria using a novel best worst method, third phase involves ranking of suppliers with respect to selection criteria weights obtained in phase two using fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution). Sensitivity analysis is also performed in order to check the robustness of the framework and eliminate the effect of biasness. The outcome of this research is helpful to rank the suppliers consequently organizations can replicate the proposed framework for supplier selection for their new product range.

In addition the developed model specifies the optimal locations for a new distribution center (DC), collection center and disposal center as well as the optimal allocation of customer zones to each DC. This model is solved in three stages: (1) a Jackson network determines the queuing parameters, (2) an Lp-metric approach makes the multi-objectives into a single objective, and (3) an efficient Lagrangian relaxation based on a sub-gradient approach solves the presented model.

The following study develops a systemic analytical framework based on which climate risks for manufacturing industries are reviewed and drivers (defined as supportive factors) of entrepreneurial robustness are examined. The analysis builds upon a case study in the alpine Austrian state of Tyrol where an intense regional rise of average temperatures occurs, going along with increased risks of natural mountain hazards and exposed settlement structures. In this climate-sensitive setting the authors conducted a survey on risk perceptions among 102 managers from manufacturing firms. Based on a comparison of the sectors metal and engineering, timber products, and construction, the authors argue that drivers of entrepreneurial robustness can be subsumed under five major strategic principles: (a) the deployment of slack resources, (b) vertical supply chain integration, (c) manufacturing flexibility, (d) material efficiency, and (e) technological risk prevention. Departing from the empirical results, the authors argue that across these principles the development of drivers depends on an interplay of structural prerequisites and human decisions on the levels of the focal firm, the supply chain network, and the political, economic, and geographic environment. In this sense, the authors conceptualize different forms of contingencies - thus effects influencing the development of drivers - within an ontology which may support further system oriented analysis of climate change adaptation in industry.

Since the 3PL service is mainly dependent on both transport vehicles and employees, managing them from the viewpoint of social sustainability has become a critical issue. Thus, 3PL providers need to be concerned about not only the service price or quality but also issues related to social sustainability. In line with this trend, we defined the social sustainability of 3PL providers and related evaluation criteria. In addition, a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used as a main evaluation framework to help decision-makers determine the relative importance of each criteria or alternative using linguistic terms. To show the feasibility of the proposed criteria and evaluation framework, we presented the illustrative example based on a real-world case.

Taken together, these pressures have created a sense of urgency to re-examine the performance, equitability and sustainability of FSCs. This paper argues for the need to acknowledge and access the multiple, contested meanings that are attributed to FSCs. Taking its lead from post-normal science, the approach developed aims to understand the different contexts and account for the 'multiple realities' that exist. Key to this has been the development of a range of attributes of FSC performance that are common across narratives of sustainability and yet framed in various ways by different categories of actors, examined across a range of national contexts and within four spheres of influence. In so doing, this approach has the potential to more widely legitimise knowledge claims regarding FSC performance. This is critical if producers, policy-makers and consumers are to have the cognitive tools to enable them to make informed decisions about the broader impacts of the different FSCs they engage with.

The model considers the uncertainties of the market-related information, i.e. the demand and transportation and shortage costs, under Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) strategy. Addressing the retailer's risk aversion level through Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) to deal with these uncertainties leads to a bi-level programming problem. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KILT) conditions are adopted to transform the model into a single-level mixed integer linear programming problem. Since, the realization of the uncertain parameters is the only information available, a data-driven approach is employed to avoid distributional assumptions. The effectiveness of the model is finally demonstrated through a numerical example. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), an important environmental policy approach, has been adopted extensively in various countries, and the effectiveness of its implementation has been proven through practical application. However, the establishment and development of EPR are lacking in most developing countries where collection and recycling systems are underdeveloped. This study addresses this problem by exploring the hierarchical relationship among the driving factors of EPR in the electronics industry in China and by identifying and ranking the factors that are critical in EPR implementation. As important managerial conclusions, research results show that EPR-related laws and regulations, the consciousness of senior executives, and corporate image are the three most important driving factors of EPR implementation.","[Zheng, Xiong; Xu, Fangchao; Feng, Lipan] Nankai Univ, Business Sch, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China","Xu, FC (corresponding author), Nankai Univ, Business Sch, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China.",xzheng79@163.com; xufc@mail.nankai.edu.cn; hnnuflp@163.com,"feng, lipan/AAF-7486-2020",,,,,60,1,1,0,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2017,9,4,,,,,,,540,10.3390/su9040540,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EV9FE,WOS:000402090300063,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

Rather than meeting this challenge by working in separate domains or via single-disciplinary perspectives, we chart the development of a system-wide approach to the food supply chain. In this approach, social and environmental questions are simultaneously addressed. Firstly, we provide a holistic model of the agri-food system, which depicts the processes involved, the principal inputs and outputs, the actors and the external influences, emphasising the system's interactions, feedbacks and complexities. Secondly, we show how this model necessitates a research programme that includes the study of land-use, crop production and protection, food processing, storage and distribution, retailing and consumption, nutrition and public health. Acknowledging the methodological and epistemological challenges involved in developing this approach, we propose two specific ways forward. Firstly, we propose a method for analysing and modelling agri-food systems in their totality, which enables the complexity to be reduced to essential components of the whole system to allow tractable quantitative analysis using LCA and related methods. This initial analysis allows for more detailed quantification of total system resource efficiency, environmental impact and waste. Secondly, we propose a method to analyse the ethical, legal and political tensions that characterise such systems via the use of deliberative fora. We conclude by proposing an agenda for agri-food research which combines these two approaches into a rational programme for identifying, testing and implementing the new agri-technologies and agri-food policies, advocating the critical application of nexus thinking to meet the global food security challenge.","[Horton, Peter; Bruce, Richard] Univ Sheffield, Grantham Ctr Sustainable Futures, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Horton, Peter] Univ Sheffield, Dept Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Banwart, Steve A.; Jackson, Peter] Univ Sheffield, Dept Geog, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Banwart, Steve A.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Brockington, Dan] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Inst Int Dev, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Brown, Garrett W.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Bruce, Richard; Koh, S.

This paper is to determine the critical quality parameter(s) in the cold chain logistics through the real time monitoring of the temperature fluctuation implemented with the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), and the correlation analysis among the various quality parameters. The assessment was conducted through three experiments. Experiment I indicated that the temperature have a large fluctuation from 0 degrees C to 30 degrees C, and the critical temperatures could be determined as 0 degrees C, 5 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C. Experiment II described that the firmness and moisture loss rate, whose Pearson correlation coefficient with the sensory evaluation. were all greater than 0.9 at the critical temperatures determined in Experiment I, could be the critical quality parameters. Experiment III illustrated that the critical quality parameters, firmness and moisture loss rate, could be reliable indicators of table grapes quality by the Arrhenius kinetic equation, and results showed that the evaluation model based on the firmness is better to predict the shelf life than that based on the moisture loss rate. The best quality table grapes could be provided for the consumers via the easily and directly tracing and controlling the critical quality parameters in real time in actual cold chain logistics.

The supplier selection decision is key to effective supply chain management. This paper investigates the problem of supplier selection under multi-source procurement for a type of divisible goods (such as coal, oil, and natural gas). By considering both the risk attributes and the attributes under a commercial criterion, we design a new two-stage compound mechanism for supplier selection based on multi-attribute auction and supply chain risk management. In the first stage, a multi-auction mechanism is established to determine the shortlist among all qualified suppliers based on four attributes (quality, price, quantity flexibility, and delivery time reliability) under a commercial criterion. In the second stage, seven risk attributes against the shortlisted suppliers are further considered, and a new ranking method based on grey correlation degree of mixed sequence is proposed to rank the finalists and to select the final winners. Moreover, the implementation, availability, and feasibility of the two-stage compound mechanism are highlighted by using an example of the multi-source procurement of electricity coal. This presented compound mechanism may well improve the procurement efficiency of divisible goods and greatly reduce the procurement risk. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

One effective method to reduce industry environmental footprint is the use of a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). The decision concerning the design and planning of an optimal network of the CLSC plays a vital role in determining the total carbon footprint across the supply chain and also the total cost. In this context, this research proposes an optimization model for design and planning a multi-period, multi-product CLSC with carbon footprint consideration under two different uncertainties. The demand and returns uncertainties are considered by means of multiple scenarios and uncertainty of carbon emissions due to supply chain related activities are considered by means of bounded box set and solve using robust optimization approach. The model extends further to investigate the impact of different carbon policies such as including strict carbon cap, carbon tax, carbon cap-and-trade, and carbon offset on the supply chain strategic and operational decisions. The model captures trade-offs that exist among supply chain total cost and carbon emissions. Also, the proposed model optimizes both supply chain total cost and carbon emissions across the supply chain activities, The numerical results reveal some insightful observations with respect to CLSC strategic design decisions and carbon emissions under various carbon policies and at the end we highlighted some managerial insights.

In addition, a hybrid model is proposed to identify the most sustainable supplier with respect to the determined attributes using an Iranian textile manufacturing company as case study. The first contribution of the research is developing a comprehensive list of sustainability criteria and sub-criteria and incorporating them into a questionnaire and distributing the questionnaire to academics and practitioners for establishing the importance and applicability of these criteria and sub-criteria. In order to demonstrate the robustness of the data obtained from the questionnaire, different established statistical tests (Cronbach's alpha and Mann-Withney U-Test) were applied. The results show that economic aspect is still the most essential aspect, followed by environmental aspect and finally social aspect. The second contribution is the development of a new hybrid model by integrating fuzzy preference programing, as one of the newest and most accurate fuzzy modification of Analytical Hierarchy Process, with Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution. Fuzzy Preference Programming overcomes the shortcomings of the previous methods for obtaining the weight and Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution prioritizes the suppliers and finds the best one under uncertainty. Generally, the developed list provides a basis that is helpful in improving suppliers' performance in terms of sustainability which leads to improvement in sustainable supply chain management performance. In addition, the developed hybrid model can deal with inconsistency, uncertainty and calculation complexity. Generally, the framework (including the first and second objectives) can be applied by managers to evaluate and determine their appropriate suppliers in the presence of uncertainty.

However, both approaches have challenges when used across spatial scales. LCA tends to decompose systemic information into micro-level functional units that mask complexity and purpose, whereas UM typically equates aggregated material and energy flows with impacts and is not ideal for revealing the mechanisms or alternatives available to reduce systemic environmental risks. This study explores the value of integrating UM with LCA, using vehicle transportation in the Phoenix metropolitan area as an illustrative case study. Where other studies have focused on the use of LCA providing upstream supply-chain impacts for UM, we assert that the broader value of the integrated approach is in (1) the ability to cross scales (from micro to macro) in environmental assessment and (2) establishing an analysis that captures function and complexity in urban systems. The results for Phoenix show the complexity in resource supply chains and critical infrastructure services, how impacts accrue well beyond geopolitical boundaries where activities occur, and potential system vulnerabilities.","[Clark, Susan Spierre] Arizona State Univ, SSEBE, POB 873005, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Chester, Mikhail V.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Sustainable Engn & affiliate Fac, Tempe, AZ USA","Clark, SS (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, SSEBE, POB 873005, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",Susan.Spierre@asu.edu,"Clark, Susan/V-8942-2019",,University of Maryland's National Transportation Center [NTC2015-SU-R-01],This research has been partially supported by a grant from the University of Maryland's National Transportation Center (Project NTC2015-SU-R-01).,,63,4,4,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

The proposed framework is green, in which it tackles the demand uncertainty of a product, environmental uncertainties, and the downstream risk attitude into the problem formulation. In this way, the demand uncertainty is taken into account through the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) method which, in turn, relies on the data driven approach. On the other hand, uncertainty set approach is employed to deal with the environmental uncertainties, i.e. CO2 emissions. Proposition of such a green supply chain network, based on the aforementioned uncertainties, makes the proposed model realistic, which is what completely missing in the literature. In order to proceed with this model, a robust counterpart of the developed uncertain problem should be formulated. The augmented epsilon-constraint method is used to transform the developed multi-objective mathematical programming problem into a single-objective one. This may give rise to the global optimal solution through the exact mathematical solution method. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework.

This article addresses the optimal design of a large-scale processing network for producing a variety of algae-based fuels and value-added bioproducts under uncertainty. We develop by far the most comprehensive processing network with 46,704 alternative processing pathways. Based on the superstructure, a two-stage adaptive robust mixed integer fractional programming model is proposed to tackle the uncertainty and select the robust optimal processing pathway with the highest ROI. Since the proposed problem cannot be solved directly by any off-the-shelf solver, we develop an efficient tailored solution method that integrates a parametric algorithm with a column-and-constraint generation algorithm. The resulting robust optimal processing pathway selects biodiesel and poly-3-hydroxybutyrate as the final fuel and bioproduct, respectively.

The paper uses Big Data analysis, followed by a survey which was analyzed using content analysis and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The results of the analysis suggest that swift trust, information sharing and public private partnership are critical enablers of resilience in supply chain networks. The current study used cross-sectional data. However the hypotheses of the study can be tested using longitudinal data to attempt to establish causality. The article advances the literature on resilience in disaster supply chain networks for sustainability in that (i) it suggests the use of Big Data analysis to propose and test particular frameworks in the context of resilient supply chains that enable sustainability; (ii) it argues that swift trust, public private partnerships, and quality information sharing link to resilience in supply chain networks; and (iii) it uses the context of Nepal, at the moment of the disaster relief activities to provide contemporaneous perceptions of the phenomenon as it takes place.

It is achieved by understanding the dynamics between various risks in perishable food supply chain and modeling them using interpretive structural modeling (ISM). Design/methodology/approach - Four categories and 17 types of risk are established from literature and conducting brainstorming sessions with managers/engineers in Indian dairy firms. A methodology is proposed using ISM, risk priority number and risk mitigation number to prioritize risk mitigation strategy decisions for the dairy industry. Findings - For a perishable food supply chain, risk positioned at lower levels (levels 1 or 2) in the hierarchy should be targeted first, while formulating mitigation strategies. To investigate further, risk-enabling factors which are identified for an Indian dairy firm for these levels 1 and 2 risks and mitigation strategy prioritization show that supplier side risks are more dominant followed by market risks and process risks. Research limitations/implications - This proposed methodology has not been statistically validated or empirically tested, and factors taken are in the Indian context, but the authors believe that the study is highly relevant to other markets as well because the ISM-based analysis is for generic perishable food supply chain environment. Practical implications - This study provides a useful approach to managers/decision makers to identify, analyze and prioritize risk in the supply chain. It also provides insights into the mutual relationships of supply chain risks which would help them to focus on the effective risk mitigation strategies formulation. The study provides the insights to benchmark and risk management in the dairy industry environment with priority considerations. Originality/value - This paper provides an integrated approach to identifying, quantify, analyze, evaluate and mitigate the risks of perishable food (in the dairy environment) in the Indian context.","[Prakash, Surya; Soni, Gunjan; Rathore, Ajay Pal Singh; Singh, Shubhender] Malaviya Natl Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India","Soni, G (corresponding author), Malaviya Natl Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India.",gunjan1980@gmail.com,"Soni, Gunjan/AAH-8236-2020; Prakash, SURYA/AAH-8849-2020","Prakash, SURYA/0000-0003-4147-9399",,,,56,36,36,0,36,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-5771,1758-4094,,BENCHMARKING,Benchmarking,,2017,24,1,,,,,2,23,,10.1108/BIJ-07-2015-0070,,,22,Management,Business & Economics,EM8WD,WOS:000395590900001,,,,,2021-03-04

CPD process improvements, in terms of complex engineering design and delivery, still lack a lot more variance to be addressed on the better, faster and cheaper paradigm for efficient communication and information exchange flow processes. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents employing social network theory analysis and statistical Pearson (r) correlation analysis in a triangulation approach to a proposed optimum conceptual information technology systems' architecture and a best practice information flow process toward enhancing an industrial sustainable competitive advantage. Closed-end questionnaires were used to collect data for the scale or level of communication network from a sample size of eight Ship Power supply chain network complex engineering design and delivery systems-design teams with at least five members from each team. Findings - Two extremely interesting findings and observations were identified from the analysis carried out (isolates and close-harmonic analysis) as well as the findings from the hypotheses' testing. These essential analyses of the engineering systems-design teams were conducted by using the triangulation or mixed-method described in the abstract methodology identified above. Originality/value - Effective and efficient real-time communication is seen as the vehicle for effective organization management. Although there may be some studies on effective technical communication in organizational and enterprise supply chain management settings, this research identifies a new robust and extensive analysis and feasible solutions to most of the communication bottlenecks and inefficient socio-industrial information flow processes, which need enhancement for industrial competitive advantage. Furthermore, the contribution of this paper further enhances the level 4 implementation aspect of the supply chain operation reference model in a replicable industry-specific perspective.","[Addo-Tenkorang, Richard; Helo, Petri T.] Univ Vaasa, Dept Prod, Vaasa, Finland; [Addo-Tenkorang, Richard] BIUST, Coll Engn & Technol, Palapye, Botswana","Addo-Tenkorang, R (corresponding author), Univ Vaasa, Dept Prod, Vaasa, Finland.; Addo-Tenkorang, R (corresponding author), BIUST, Coll Engn & Technol, Palapye, Botswana.",raddotenkorang@yahoo.com,"Helo, Petri T/F-8077-2015; Addo-Tenkorang, Richard/P-8413-2014","Helo, Petri T/0000-0002-0501-2727; Addo-Tenkorang, Richard/0000-0002-0358-4211",,,,71,3,3,1,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0957-4093,1758-6550,,INT J LOGIST MANAG,Int.

Design/methodology/approach - DEMATEL-based analytic network process (DANP) questionnaire survey with a theoretical SSCM model is applied to conduct an empirical test for the coal production and supply chain companies in Indonesia. Findings - The performance dimension out of the A-I-P of the SSCM is the most important one, while the adoption dimension is the least. Out of the 12 criteria under the three dimensions, the operational, economic, environmental, and social factors under the category of the performance dimension and the ISO 14001 certification criteria belonging to the dimension of implementation are the top five key factors in the SSCM. Research limitations/implications - There are some limitations in this study. First and foremost is the relatively small sample size with a limited geographic area, although they are unavoidable owing to one country case study. Practical implications - The test results are helpful to draw guidance for sustainable supply chain managers in implementing efficient SSCM in the wave of tough competition and changing marketplace. Originality/value - This study contributes first to developing a theoretical framework for SSCM under the A-I-P model and second, to applying DANP to an empirical case of SSCM of the coal industry in Indonesia. As a result, the authors draw helpful guidelines and policy implications for SSCM of the coal industry, referring to the A-I-P dimension as drivers and enablers for the SSCM performances of the industry.","[Wu, Jei-Zheng; Roan, Jinshyang] Soochow Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taipei, Taiwan; [Santoso, Caroline Himadewi] Soochow Univ, Sch Business, Global Business Program, Taipei, Taiwan","Wu, JZ (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taipei, Taiwan.",jzwu@scu.edu.tw,"Wu）, 吳吉政（Jei-Zheng/C-6046-2013","Wu）, 吳吉政（Jei-Zheng/0000-0003-4834-1106","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC102-2632-H-031-001-MY3]","This research is supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (NSC102-2632-H-031-001-MY3).

Using the environment-strategy-performance view framework and the supporting relational perspective, the study develops a model and hypotheses to understand how supply chain partnership strategy as a response to co-align with operating context elements may impact operational and overall firm performance. Additionally, the study investigates the interrelationships among partnership strategy elements. Design/methodology/approach - Data for testing the hypothesized relationships in the conceptual model was collected through a survey of managers in the Hoover's database of US manufacturing firms. The survey sample included 115 responses from a wide variety of manufacturing forms. Findings - Findings support the conventional wisdom relating collaboration to operational and financial performance. While product complexity associates with the building block resources, resource complementarity and resource specificity, technological turbulence relates significantly with only resource specificity. Interestingly, competitive intensity associates differentially with the resources - positive with resource specificity and negatively with resource complementarity. The results also reveal mediating influences of resource specificity and collaboration. Research limitations/implications - The research findings have to be considered in context. The moderate size, wide industry/firm diversity and robust research design notwithstanding, and the cross-firm nature can potentially obscure causal linkages. Besides, more comprehensive insights could be obtained by modeling the co-alignment of strategy with other factors in the operating context such as industry munificence, and market unpredictability. Practical implications - Firms derive operational and financial performance benefits from close collaboration with partners since the operational enhancements from such relationships have customer service implications. Besides, the synergistic interrelationships among strategic partnership resources and their eventual impact on operational and financial performance is highlighted suggesting that firms develop a proper mix of unique and complementing set of resources and leverage them through collaborative behaviors. Importantly, the results provide a framework for managers to understand the criticality of aligning their resources with contextual elements to realize enhanced operational efficiencies, customer service, and financial benefits. Originality/value - Much of the evidence on the rent generation capabilities in supply chain partnerships is still anecdotal and extant empirical research lacks adequate explanation. Thus this study offers an initial strategic response framework for an appropriate co-alignment of partnership resources with environmental context factors to realize operational benefits and overall financial performance. The framework answers the critical question: does a supply chain partnership strategy that matches fit or co-aligns with its critical operating environment context realize better performance? Additionally, it unravels the interrelationships among strategic partnership resources.","[Srivastava, Prashant] Drexel Univ, Dept Mkt, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Iyer, Karthik N.

However, appropriately assessing farm environmental performance poses a challenge; a plethora of different indicators have been used for this purpose, sometimes in the absence of conceptual considerations. This paper develops a broadly implementable framework for defining and measuring farm environmental performance which complies with the environmental sustainability concept viewed from an ecological perspective. After providing a critical review of existing indicators in the literature for measuring farm environmental performance and identifying their strengths and above all their weaknesses, it proceeds to develop ideas on how to implement the environmental sustainability concept at farm level. Starting at the macro level, these ideas are based on the central concept of ecosystem carrying capacity (constraints) referring to biophysical threshold thinking. The implementation of this concept at farm level results in the framework that we propose for measuring farm environmental performance. Environmental sustainability requires compliance with the carrying capacity constraints imposed by the natural ecosystem within which a farm operates. Compliance with carrying capacity must occur at both local and global ecosystem levels, requiring a distinction between local and global farm environmental performance. The global environmental performance of a farm is defined as its relative contribution to compliance with the carrying capacity of the global ecosystem, and is measured by means of an indicator of environmental intensity over the entire production chain up to the farm gate. The local carrying-capacity constraint can be understood as the maximum environmental impact per unit of farmland area that can be sustained by the local ecosystem. Local environmental performance is therefore measured by means of an area-based indicator. Whereas all environmental issues must be considered at a global level, for some of them local level consideration is also required. Implementing separate local and global environmental performance indicators, as opposed to using only global or local indicators without distinguishing between them in conceptual terms, provides a more appropriate assessment of the environmental performance of farms, as well as a better basis for comparison between farms. Furthermore, it eliminates the risk of shifting environmental problems from the local to the global scale or vice-versa. The framework highlights the complexity of the environmental sustainability concept, which cannot be reduced to a single one size fits all indicator. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, a systematic and sustainability-focused evaluation system for supplier selection is needed from an organizational supply chain perspective. This work proposes a framework to evaluate sustainable supplier selection by using an integrated Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), ViseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), a multi-criteria optimization and compromise solution approach. Initially, 22 sustainable supplier selection criteria and three dimensions of criteria (economic, environmental, and social) have been identified through literature and experts' opinions. A real world example of an automobile company in India is discussed to demonstrate the proposed framework applicability. According to the findings, 'Environmental costs; 'Quality of product,' 'Price of product' Occupational health and safety systems,' and 'Environmental competencies' have been ranked as the top five sustainable supplier selection criteria. In addition, out of the five sustainable supplier's alternatives, supplier number 'three' got the highest rank. The work presented in this paper may help managers and business professionals not only to distinguish the important supplier selection criteria but also to evaluate the most efficient supplier for sustainability in supply chain, while remaining competitive in the market. Sensitivity analysis is also conducted to test the proposed framework robustness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The evaluation results demonstrate the desirable efficiency of PD-LBP from both the shorter problem solving time and smaller communication requirement of task allocation in dynamic environments.

The problem addresses the level of risk aversion of the retailer when dealing with the uncertainty of market related information through a conditional value at risk (CVaR) approach. This approach leads to a bilevel programming problem. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are employed to transform the model into a single-level, mixed-integer linear programming problem by considering some relaxations. Since realizations of imprecisely known parameters are the only information available, a data-driven approach is employed as a suitable, more practical, methodology of avoiding distributional assumptions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated through a numerical example.","[Golpira, Heris] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Snanadaj Branch, Sanandaj, Iran","Golpira, H (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Snanadaj Branch, Sanandaj, Iran.",Herishgolpira@gmail.com,"Golpira, Heris/X-7870-2018","Golpira, Heris/0000-0003-1346-9572",,,,33,4,4,0,7,"WROCLAW UNIV SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, FAC COMPUTER SCIENCE MANAGEMENT",WROCLAW,"WYBRZEZE WYSPIANSKIEGO 27, WROCLAW, 50-370, POLAND",2081-8858,,,OPER RES DECIS,Oper.

Unfortunately, a majority of these entrepreneurs are simply unable to derive sufficient value from the network and are vulnerable to disasters and poverty. The purpose of this paper is to develop a typology that examines dynamic and triadic power relationships in order to create value chains for BoP producers. Design/methodology/approach - This paper builds upon the available literature and a relevant historical case study to develop a typology. The validity of the typology is ascertained by examining and comparing two current BoP silk weaver communities in India. Findings - The typology captures essential environmental variables and relates them to mediated and non-mediated forms of power which, in turn, shape the value derived from the supply chain network. Practical implications - The typology provides specific recommendations for BoP producers, such as the formation of cooperatives, engaging in political unionization and ensuring that their social networks expand beyond local communities. Originality/value - The typology brings together structuration theory and power and provides a framework for understanding supply value. This typology is generalizable to dynamic multi-tiered supply chain networks.","[Prasad, Sameer; Jaffe, James] Univ Wisconsin, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA; [Bhattacharyya, Kuntal] Indiana State Univ, Dept Mkt & Operat, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA; [Tata, Jasmine] Loyola Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL USA; [Marshall, Donna] Univ Coll Dublin, Michael Smurfit Grad Sch Business, Dublin, Ireland","Prasad, S (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA.",prasads@uww.edu,,,,,,83,5,5,1,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2042-6747,2042-6755,,J HUMANIT LOGIST SUP,J.

Companies are expected to ensure their products are fully traceable and more sustainable, which requires the involvement of all of the actors in the production network. According to this aim, this study proposes a structured approach that uses the traditional traceability concept as a means to identify the main information needed to assess environmental impacts along the whole supply chain (SC). The proposed approach is composed of four main steps: (i) SC modelling to identify all stakeholders and their inter-relations, (ii) data sharing to collect all relevant data, (iii) data elaboration to calculate performance at different levels of detail and (iv) result interpretation to optimise the SC. The distributed implementation of the approach at different SC steps represents a useful means to practically realise a sustainable SC management. A case study involving a leather shoe SC is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in identifying criticalities, supporting the selection of the most appropriate suppliers and correctly setting a management strategy towards the optimisation of internal and external traceability and environmental sustainability performances.","[Marconi, Marco; Marilungo, Eugenia; Papetti, Alessandra; Germani, Michele] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Ind Engn & Math Sci, Ancona, Italy","Marconi, M (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Ind Engn & Math Sci, Ancona, Italy.",marco.marconi@univpm.it,,"Marconi, Marco/0000-0002-5677-1459; Germani, Michele/0000-0003-1988-8620",,,,45,18,19,3,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

The proposed model considers a multi-coupling and multi-level supply chain network. We use partial differential equations to form the coupled map lattices (CML) to model the behavior of non-linear network systems from perspectives of space and time dimension under different disruptions.

However, in the real-life industrial engineering applications, the multidimensional knapsack problem often comes with uncertainty about a lack of information about these parameters. This paper investigates a constrained multidimensional knapsack problem under uncertain environment, in which the relevant parameters are assumed to be uncertain variables. Within the framework of uncertainty theory, two types of uncertain programming models with discount constraints are constructed for the problem with different decision criteria, including the expected value criterion and the critical value criterion. Taking full advantage of the operational law for uncertain variables, the proposed models can be transformed into their corresponding deterministic models. After theoretically investigating the properties of the models, we do some numerical experiments. The numerical results illustrate that the proposed models are feasible and efficient for solving the constrained multidimensional knapsack problem with uncertain parameters.

The modeling approach adopted aims at the embedding supply chain risks in a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network design process and suggests optimal supply chain configuration and risk mitigation strategies. Design/methodology/approach - The method proposes a closed-loop supply chain network and identifies the network parameter and variables required for closing the loop. Mixed-integer-linear-programming-based mathematical modeling approach is used to formulate the research problem. The solutions and test results are obtained from CPLEX solver. Findings - The outcomes of the proposed model were demonstrated through a case study conducted in an Indian hospital furniture manufacturing firm. The modern supply chain is mapped to make it closed loop, and potential risks in its supply chain are identified. The supply chain network of the firm is redesigned through embedding risk in the modeling process. It was found that companies can be in great profit if they follow closed-loop practices and simultaneously keep a check on risks as well. The cost of making the supply chain risk averse was found to be insignificant. Practical implications - Although the study was conducted in a practical case situation, the obtained results are not indiscriminate to the other circumstances. However, the approach followed and proposed methodology can be applied to many industries once a firm decides to redesign its supply chain for closing its loop or model under risks. Originality/value - By using the identified CLSC parameters and applying the proposed network design methodology, a firm can design/redesign their supply chain network to counter the risk and accordingly come up with planned mitigation strategies to achieve a certain degree of robustness.","[Prakash, Surya] BML Munjal Univ, Dept Mech Engn, SoET, Gurgaon, India; [Soni, Gunjan; Rathore, Ajay Pal Singh] Malaviya Natl Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India","Prakash, S (corresponding author), BML Munjal Univ, Dept Mech Engn, SoET, Gurgaon, India.",suryayadav8383@gmail.com,"Prakash, SURYA/AAH-8849-2020; PRAKASH, SURYA/O-8135-2017; Soni, Gunjan/AAH-8236-2020","Prakash, SURYA/0000-0003-4147-9399; PRAKASH, SURYA/0000-0003-4147-9399; ",,,,39,9,9,0,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-5664,1746-5672,,J MODEL MANAG,J.

The findings show that authentic lifestyles, motivated by intrinsic not just extrinsic rewards, are driving disruptive social change upstream and downstream in the tourist food supply chain. Small food business owner-managers are catalysts for common good, and as supporters for ethical and sustainable food chains have considerable local tourism influence and impact.

J,"Torrey, WF",,,,"Torrey, W. Ford",,,Estimating the Cost of Congestion to the Trucking Industry Standardized Methodology for Congestion Monitoring and Monetization,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Because of the critical role of safe and reliable truck movements in sustainable economic growth, public- and private-sector transportation managers continually monitor and evaluate the efficiency of the national roadway system. A key impediment to nimble supply chains is the level of traffic congestion experienced on U.S. roadways and the subsequent costs that are incurred because of that congestion. To facilitate the development of a methodology for quantifying congestion, a standardized approach is presented for calculating congestion figures that are comparative on a year-over-year basis. With this methodology, time delays on the National Highway System in 2014 were calculated at more than 728 million hours, equating to approximately $49.6 billion in increased congestion-related costs to the trucking industry. The congestion was heavily concentrated in urban areas, with 88.1% of the total cost occurring on only 17.6% of the National Highway System network. The lost productivity is equivalent to 264,781 commercial truck drivers sitting idle for an entire working year. Additionally, the average truck experienced an increased cost of $4,546 because of congestion, a figure that varied widely depending on the number of miles a particular truck traveled in a particular area. Finally, the presented standardized methodology enables 2014 to be used as a base year for comparison with future years, allowing for the monitoring of congestion effects over time. As a result, transportation planners and managers can evaluate system metrics such as planning efficiency and productivity for a longer time. The methodology also supports assessment of shorter-term events, such as natural disasters and infrastructure improvement projects.","[Torrey, W.

Through a detailed review of the literature on parcel logistics pertaining to collaboration, along with practical insights from carriers operating in the United Kingdom, this paper examines the challenges that will be faced in optimizing multicarrier, multidrop collection, and delivery schedules. A freight traffic controller (FTC) concept is proposed. The FTC would be a trusted third party, assigned to equitably manage the work allocation between collaborating carriers and the passage of vehicles over the last mile when joint benefits to the parties could be achieved. Creating this FTC concept required a combinatorial optimization approach for evaluation of the many combinations of hub locations, network configuration, and routing options for vehicle or walking to find the true value of each potential collaboration. At the same time, the traffic, social, and environmental impacts of these activities had to be considered. Cooperative game theory is a way to investigate the formation of collaborations (or coalitions), and the analysis used in this study identified a significant shortfall in current applications of this theory to last-mile parcel logistics. Application of theory to urban freight logistics has, thus far, failed to account for critical concerns including (a) the mismatch of vehicle parking locations relative to actual delivery addresses; (b) the combination of deliveries with collections, requests for the latter often being received in real time during the round; and (c) the variability in travel times and route options attributable to traffic and road network conditions.","[Allen, Julian; Piecyk, Maja; Piotrowska, Marzena] Univ Westminster, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, 35 Marylebone Rd, London NW1 5LS, England; [Bektas, Tolga] Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Highfield Campus,Univ Rd, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Cherrett, Tom; McLeod, Fraser] Univ Southampton, Fac Engn & Environm, Boldrewood Innovat Campus,Burgess Rd, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Friday, Adrian] Univ Lancaster, Sch Comp & Commun, InfoLab21, South Dr, Lancaster LA1 4WA, England; [Austwick, Martin Zaltz] UCL, Fac Built Environm, 90 Tottenham Court Rd, London W1T 4TJ, England","Cherrett, T (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Fac Engn & Environm, Boldrewood Innovat Campus,Burgess Rd, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",t.j.cherrett@soton.ac.uk,"; McLeod, Fraser/O-7541-2018","Bektas, Tolga/0000-0003-0634-144X; Allen, Jonathan P./0000-0002-6510-8990; Friday, Adrian/0000-0002-9228-7365; McLeod, Fraser/0000-0002-5784-9342",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/N02222X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,,,46,17,17,5,35,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0361-1981,2169-4052,,TRANSPORT RES REC,Transp.

Green supplier selection is one of the most critical activities in the low-carbon supply chain management, so it is important to establish the comprehensive criteria and develop a method for green supplier selection in low-carbon supply chain. The paper proposes a fuzz-grey multicriteria decision making approach to deal with these problems. First, the paper establishes 4 main criteria and 22 subcriteria for green supplier selection. Then, a method integrating fuzzy set theory and grey relational analysis is proposed. It uses the membership function of normal distribution to compare each supplier and uses grey relation analysis to calculate the weight of each criterion and improves fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. The proposed method can make the localization of individual green supplier more objectively and more accurately in the same trade. Finally, a case study in the steel industry is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","[Pang, Qinghua; Yang, Tiantian; Li, Mingzhen; Shen, Yi] Hohai Univ, Sch Business Adm, Changzhou 213022, Peoples R China","Pang, QH (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Sch Business Adm, Changzhou 213022, Peoples R China.",pangqh77@126.com,,"Pang, Qinghua/0000-0003-3153-3136","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2015B24014, 2017B43314]",This research was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (nos. 2015B24014 and 2017B43314).,,39,5,5,1,18,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1024-123X,1563-5147,,MATH PROBL ENG,Math.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework for the selection of suppliers by evaluating them on the basis of both quantitative and qualitative data. Design/methodology/approach - Literature on sustainability, green supply chain and lean practices related to supplier selection is critically reviewed. Based on this, a two phase fuzzy goal programming approach integrating hyperbolic membership function is proposed to solve the complex supplier selection problem. Findings - Results obtained through the proposed approach are compared to the traditional models (Jadidi et al., 2014; Ozkok and Tiryaki, 2011; Zimmermann, 1978) of supplier selection and were found to be optimal as it achieves higher aspiration level. Practical implications - The proposed model is adaptive to solve real world problems of supplier selection as all criteria do not possess the same weights, so the managers can change the criteria and their weights according to their requirement. Originality/value - This paper provides the decision makers a robust framework to evaluate and select sustainable supplier based on both quantitative and qualitative data.

The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - A structured questionnaire survey enabled identification of typically significant stakeholders in the PM and FM phases. In total, 14 key stakeholders were identified through t-test analysis in this Sri Lankan study. Semi-structured interviews unveiled relationships among the aforementioned stakeholders and the findings were used to develop the required RIVANS-TFM, as well as the existing RIVANS-TFM, using the UCINET social network analysis software package. Social network theory of relationships was applied to analyze the networks in terms of Structural Holes or missing links and Brokerage Potentials. Findings - Structural holes analysis highlighted the existing setup to be more vulnerable to missing links than the required/targeted setup. Furthermore, brokerage potentials analysis revealed that owners, project managers, facility managers, maintenance engineers, main contractors, designers, principal consultants, and other specialist consultants can act as brokers to bridge the gaps or minimize structural holes, thereby uplifting and reinforcing the existing network to deliver better performance and value in TFM. Originality/value - By revealing existing and required levels of integration of each stakeholder in RIVANS-TFM, clients are provided a great opportunity to identify the stakeholders who should be engaged more, or less - in order to best achieve clients' long-term aspirations and project objectives. Furthermore, the findings also indicate appropriate levels of stakeholder relationships to target, in order to maintain efficient flows of information, material and services in the supply chains while enhancing TFM life-cycle values.","[De Silva, Nayanthara; Weerasinghe, R.

The innovative concept has the advantage of adding flexibility, cost reduction, and sustainability among other things, into the freight transportation system. The synchromodal system has not been started in any developing country yet due to its newness. In this study, we used multiple methodologies to conduct a feasibility study for the possibilities of introducing the concept in a developing country, Ghana. An intensive literature review was performed using the Grounded Theory and the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) method to identify the key factors for the introduction of the synchromodal concept. Questionnaires were administered to the primary stakeholders in the maritime-hinterland transportation sector to solicit their views about the factors necessary for the implementation. We next carried out SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis to catalogue the strengths and weakness of the country in introducing the concept. The multiple regression analysis method was used to analyse the experience of stakeholders in the freight transportation business and their knowledge about the synchromodal freight transportation system.

These, however, sometimes fail to capture interdependency among communities for basic resources. This paper aims to propose a framework for characterizing vulnerability caused by interdependency by adapting a supply chain lens. Design/methodology/approach - The paper proposes a definition for indirect vulnerability that recognizes the transboundary and teleconnected nature of vulnerability arising from resource networks among cities and communities. A conceptual framework using a supply chain approach is presented for climate hazards in particular. This approach is then demonstrated through a rapid appraisal of the rice, energy and water supply chains and the waste management chains of Metro Manila. Findings - The application of the supply chain lens to assessing the indirect vulnerability of Metro Manila brings to fore issues extending beyond the decision-making boundaries of local government units. Addressing these will require vertical government coordination and horizontal inter-sectoral collaboration. Thus, this supply chain-based indirect vulnerability assessment can be complementary to traditional vulnerability assessments in providing a larger systems perspective. Originality/value - Innovative tools are needed to make community vulnerability assessments both holistic and tractable. Existing methods in the private sector can be adapted rather than reinventing the wheel. This supply chain framework can be a useful decision support and planning tool across governance levels to comprehensively address vulnerability.","[Kendra Gotangco, Charlotte; Marie Favis, Abigail; Leah Guzman, Ma.

A second set of case studies analysed how these companies leverage SC management practices to develop sustainable SCs. In so doing, specific attention was paid to drivers and contingent variables that foster the adoption of sustainable practices. The results of the two steps were then merged to illuminate how practices adopted by the meat processors can impact on the whole chain, confirming their pivotal role in driving sustainability.

In this study, a robust optimization model is introduced to deal with the inherent uncertainty of input data in the location and vehicle routing scheduling problems in cross-docking distribution networks. For this purpose, a new two-phase deterministic mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed for locating cross-docks and scheduling vehicle routing with multiple cross-docks. Then, the robust counterpart of the proposed two-phase MILP model is proposed by employing the recent developments in robust optimization theory. Finally, to evaluate the robustness of obtained solutions by the new robust optimization model, a comparison is made with the obtained solutions by the deterministic MILP model in a number of realizations based on different test problems. Moreover, a meta-heuristic algorithm, namely self-adaptive imperialist competitive algorithm (SAICA), is presented for the multiple vehicle location-routing problems. Finally, this study provides various computational test problems to demonstrate the applicability and capability of the proposed robust two-phase MILP model and meta-heuristic solution approach.","[Mousavi, S.

Uncertainties in yield, quality, price, and infrastructure in one part of the supply chain can affect the whole chain. To ensure a sustainable seaweed industry, an appropriate supply chain risk management (SCRM) is needed. There are four critical steps in SCRM: identifying seaweed supply chains, identifying and categorizing risks, assessing risks, and mitigating risks. To identify seaweed supply chains, we conducted field research, in-depth interviews, and literature studies. The field survey was conducted in the Provinces of South Sulawesi, West Java, East Java, Banten, and West Nusa Tenggara. The seaweed supply chains were modeled by the software Umberto to get a better understanding of material and energy flows between the key members. To identify and categorize the risks, we started with the risks mentioned in the existing literature works, and then applied the Delphi method to analyze the potential risk sources, their causes, and their impacts. To assess risks, we used a semiquantitative approach through the face-to-face interviews to generate a risk map showing the likelihood, and impact of adverse events. Afterward, the risk intensity was categorized based on the value of the responses and classified into five categories: negligible, marginal, critical, most critical, and catastrophic risks. The mitigation strategies considered sustainability (environment, economy, and social) and risks criteria. Multi-criteria decision analysis was used to evaluate these strategies.","[Mulyati, Heti] Bogor Agr Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Jl Kamper, Bogor 16680, Indonesia; [Geldermann, Jutta] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Chair Prod & Logist, Pl Goettinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Mulyati, H (corresponding author), Bogor Agr Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Jl Kamper, Bogor 16680, Indonesia.",heti.mulyati@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de; geldermann@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de,,,Japan Indonesia Presidential Scholarship (JIPS); World Bank Institute,"The authors gratefully acknowledge to the Japan Indonesia Presidential Scholarship (JIPS), the World Bank Institute for funding the study.",,52,10,10,3,34,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-954X,1618-9558,,CLEAN TECHNOL ENVIR,Clean Technol.

However, insufficient investment and inefficient supply chains have hampered the viability of reuse and/or recycling because of the extended time intervals between the recycling process of recovery and reuse. Manufacturers and distributors face the challenge and necessity to reduce these process delays in order to recover the maximum value of the returned products through an effective, responsive closed loop supply chain (CLSC). This paper quantitatively measures the effective responsiveness of the CLSC model in terms of time and energy efficiency. The proposed multi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MOMILP) model evaluates delay parameters with decision variables that maximize profit, optimize customer surplus and minimize energy use. The model suggests decision makers may achieve an optimal tradeoff among differing objectives in a multiple-objective CLSC scenario. We employed a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) approach to solve the proposed MOMILP model and compared our approach with the Non-Dominated Sorted Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) for optimal solution. Results of the comparative evolutionary approaches shows that MOPSO outperforms NSGA-II in almost all cases in achieving the best trade-off solutions. Sensitivity analysis carried out to test the robustness of the model confirms that substantially less cost is feasible through the reduction of return process delays. This paper aims to formulate a multi-objective CLSC problem based on a network-flow model measuring the time value to recover maximum assets lost due to delay at different stages of the recycle process. We also developed a particle swarm approach for a multi-objective CLSC. Our study also offers valuable insights for designers wishing to create a product flow network with an optimal capacity level in case of prioritized objectives scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The goal is to hedge against business uncertainties, so as to maximize the robustness of operations, maximize responsiveness by generating operational flexibility at the minimum cost, use of inventories and environmental impact, and to build resilience in global manufacturing, in order to achieve strategic flexibility. The Triple R is achieved by integrating major operational items, including planning, scheduling, real-time optimization and control. This article reviews existing contributions in the field of global manufacturing, and synthesizes these into a single conceptual model of Triple R. The overview is provided in terms of the development of decision support tools and methods, particularly the development of mathematical programming. The review reveals the fact that there have been limited contributions on the social side of sustainability. Environmental impact can be assessed by considering the product life cycle, yet the integration of R&D into global manufacturing operations has received limited contributions. On the modelling side, there are three dominant approaches: transfer pricing, strategic sourcing strategy, and logistics networks design. The paper ends by presenting a conceptual model and providing a methodological procedure for building the Triple R in global manufacturing. We also suggest implementing more advanced modelling and solution methods, which cover not only logistics and transports, but also the integration of concurrent engineering (CE) with aggregate production planning and scheduling.

Those studies that did emphasise on optimisation of orders among suppliers, did not consider all three dimensions of sustainability. To establish an improved sustainable supply chain, this study uses integrated fuzzy AHP and fuzzy multi-objective linear programming approach for order allocation among suppliers. fuzzy AHP has been used for weighing various factors such as quality, lead time, cost, energy use, waste minimisation, emission, and social contribution, and weights of the factors have been considered for developing linear programming.

This may require an organization to change the way it does business, designs product and manages supply chain. As these three areas are interdependent, bringing change in one area will influence the others, for instance, changing the business model from conventional sales to leasing will demand changes in both product design and the supply chain. At the same time, it is essential for an organization to anticipate the economic and environmental impact of all changes before it may decide to implement the circular product systems. However, there is no tool available today that can assess economic and environmental performance of circular product systems. The purpose of this research is to develop a multi-method simulation based tool that can help to evaluate economic and environmental performance of circular product systems. Method: The conceptual models that are used to develop the tool have been formulated based on review of the state-of-the-art research. System Dynamics (SD) and Agent Based (AB) principles have been used to create the simulation model which has been implemented in Anylogic software platform. Originality: This research presents the first multi-method simulation based tool that can evaluate economic and environmental performance of circular product systems. Findings: Multi-method simulation technique is useful in designing dynamic simulation model that takes into consideration mutual interactions among critical factors of business model, product design and supply chain. It also allows predicting system's behaviour and its influence on the economic and environmental performance of circular product systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, these seldom take into account the practical and economic implications of implementing these strategies, notably, supply of forest plants and seed. Using semi-structured interviews with practitioners involved in the plant and seed supply chain in Great Britain, we highlight a series of practical and economic bottlenecks commonly encountered in the supply of locally sourced seed and domestically produced planting stock for native woodland and hedging markets. We find that adoption of alternative seed sourcing strategies, designed specifically to account for directional climate warming, is likely to exacerbate existing problems by adding further complexity to decisions nurseries make about tree species and seed origins to produce. The lack of long-term market predictability brought about by the current configuration of forestry grants and regulations and, in particular, the administrative systems for processing grant applications is identified as a major impediment to having a sustainable and competitive supply of home-grown and currently adapted planting stock. Finally, the time and effort it takes to supply healthy plants for native woodland creation projects deserves much wider recognition throughout the industry and will be crucial if planting objectives are to be met sustainably.

Although, in recent decades, many changes have occurred in the construction industry, there are still many problems in this area. Therefore, research in this area becomes vital because collaboration is one of the best approaches to improve CSC performance. In this study, collaborative relationship has been found to be affected by three main factors: managerial, financial and structural. However, application of collaboration in Iran is still in its inception. This comprehensive research study focuses on suitable context for implementing the collaboration method. The methodology of this research is based on interviews and a review of previous research, which identifies critical factors and positive results of use in relation to collaboration. Results of this study improve our knowledge about the role of collaboration in a CSC's performance.

Conceptual framework, mathematical programming, and computational algorithms have been developed for decision-making at strategic, tactical, and operational levels of a reverse supply chain. In this paper, a novel idea for the design and planning of a general reverse logistics network is suggested and formulated through multi-objective mixed integer programming. The reverse logistics system is an independent network and comprises of three echelons for collection, remanufacturing, recycling, energy recovery, and disposal of used products. The mathematical model not only takes into account the minimization of system operating costs, but also considers minimization of carbon emissions related to the transportation and processing of used products, and the minimum rate of resource utilization is also required in order to minimize the waste of resources in landfill. Illustration, sensitivity analysis, and numerical experimentation are given to show the applicability and computational efficiency of the proposed model. This work provides an alternative approach to account both economic and environmental sustainability of a reverse logistics system. The result explicitly shows the trade-off between the costs and carbon emissions, cost effectiveness for improving environmental performance, and influences from resource utilization, all of which have great practical implication on decision-making of network configurations and transportation planning of a reverse logistics system. For future development of this work, suggestions are also given latter in this paper.","[Yu, Hao; Solvang, Wei Deng] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Fac Engn Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Narvik, Nordland, Norway","Yu, H (corresponding author), UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Fac Engn Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Narvik, Nordland, Norway.",hao.yu@uit.no,"Solvang, Wei D./A-5904-2011; Yu, Hao/H-8461-2019","Yu, Hao/0000-0002-2091-5983; Solvang, Wei Deng/0000-0002-3723-9205","TARGET project, EU Northern Periphery and Arctic (NPA) Programme","The authors would like to express their gratitude to the reviewers and editors for their valuable suggestions which significantly improve the quality of the paper.

This paper proposes a simulation-based evolutionary algorithm approach for deriving the operational planning of global supply chains from the systematic risk management, which proactively deals with the negative consequences of random and hazardous risk events in sourcing, production, distribution, and transportation in an integrated way. The proposed approach incorporates the production lot size of the plant, order quantity and reorder point of DC, and five response coefficients as decision variables to potential risks. The proposed approach is successfully applied to an industrial example of a consumer electronics manufacturing company. The results of the computational study show that the systematic risk management of global supply chains using the proposed approach increases the profit by 20% and 16.1% in the industrial example in comparison with passive and active risk management, respectively. In addition, a mixed strategy for the inventory management of distribution centers is suggested to improve the profits of global supply chains subject to substantial risks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Dis-integration can reduce costs, but also limits the ability to monitor and control critical processes, including labor practices and the sourcing of supplies. This article asks: What organizational factors distinguish corporations that are able to vouch for their supply chains from those that are not? Section 1502 of the Dodd Frank Act of 2010 gave companies over three years to determine and report on whether their products contained conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of Congo area. Our analysis of every conflict minerals report submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission by over 1,300 corporations found that almost 80% admitted they were unable to determine the country of origin of such materials, and only 1% could certify themselves conflict-free with certainty beyond reasonable doubt. Internationally diversified firms and those with large and more dispersed supply chains were less likely to declare their products conflict-free: complexity reduces the visibility of a firm's supply chain. Our results suggest that widespread outsourcing may have reduced the corporate sector's capacity to account for the practices that yield its products.","[Kim, Yong H.] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Management & Org, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Davis, Gerald F.] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Management, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Kim, YH (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Management & Org, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",yonghyun@umich.edu; gfdavis@umich.edu,,"Kim, Yong/0000-0001-9013-9177",,,,78,59,59,16,158,ACAD MANAGEMENT,BRIARCLIFF MANOR,"PACE UNIV, PO BOX 3020, 235 ELM RD, BRIARCLIFF MANOR, NY 10510-8020 USA",0001-4273,1948-0989,,ACAD MANAGE J,Acad.

Yet, in the logistics industry, there are several vaguenesses, such as deciding on key indicators and determining interrelationships between performance indicators. In order to resolve these vaguenesses, this paper first presents the stakeholder-informed Balanced Scorecard (BSC) model, by incorporating financial (e.g. cost) and non-financial (e.g. social media) performance indicators, with a comprehensive approach as a response to the major shortcomings of the generic BSC regarding the negligence of different stakeholders. Subsequently, since the indicators are not independent of each other, a robust multi-criteria decision making technique, the Analytic Network Process (ANP) method is implemented to analyze the interrelationships. The integration of these two techniques provides a novel way to evaluate logistics performance indicators from logisticians' perspective. This is a matter that has not been addressed in the logistics industry to date, and as such remains a gap that needs. to be investigated. Therefore, the proposed model identifies key performance indicators as well as various stakeholders in the logistics industry, and analyzes the interrelationships among the indicators by using the ANP. Consequently, the results show that educated employee (15.61%) is the most important indicator for the competitiveness of logistics companies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To explore in detail the relationships connecting materials to the products that require them, we map supply chains for five product platforms (a cadmium telluride solar cell, a germanium solar cell, a turbine blade, a lead acid battery, and a hard drive (HD) magnet) using a data ontology that specifies the supply chain actors (nodes) and linkages (e.g., material exchange and contractual relationships) among them. We then propose a set of network indicators (product complexity, producer diversity, supply chain length, and potential bottlenecks) to assess the situation for each platform in the overall supply chain networks. Among the results of interest are the following: (1) the turbine blade displays a high product complexity, defined by the material linkages to the platform; (2) the germanium solar cell is produced by only a few manufacturers globally and requires more physical transformation steps than do the other project platforms; (3) including production quantity and sourcing countries in the assessment shows that a large portion of nodes of the supply chain of the hard-drive magnet are located in potentially unreliable countries. We conclude by discussing how the network analysis of supply chains could be combined with criticality and scenario analyses of abiotic raw materials to comprise a comprehensive picture of product platform risk.

In recent years sustainability has received more attention in supply chain management (SCM) literature with triple bottom lines including social, environmental, and economic factors. Conventional data envelopment analysis (DEA) models consider decision making units (DMUs) as black boxes that consume a set of inputs to produce a set of outputs and do not take into consideration internal interactions of DMUs. Two-stage DEA models deal with such DMUs. However, existing two-stage DEA models are applicable only in technologies characterized by positive inputs/outputs. This paper aims to build and present a new two-stage DEA model considering negative input-intermediate-output data. Some numerical examples along with some theorems and properties are given to show capability of proposed method.

Aquatic food security is achieved when a food supply is sufficient, safe, sustainable, shockproof and sound: sufficient, to meet needs and preferences of people; safe, to provide nutritional benefit while posing minimal health risks; sustainable, to provide food now and for future generations; shock-proof, to provide resilience to shocks in production systems and supply chains; and sound, to meet legal and ethical standards for welfare of animals, people and environment. Here, we present an integrated assessment of these elements of the aquatic food system in the United Kingdom, a system linked to dynamic global networks of producers, processors and markets. Our assessment addresses sufficiency of supply from aquaculture, fisheries and trade; safety of supply given biological, chemical and radiation hazards; social, economic and environmental sustainability of production systems and supply chains; system resilience to social, economic and environmental shocks; welfare of fish, people and environment; and the authenticity of food. Conventionally, these aspects of the food system are not assessed collectively, so information supporting our assessment is widely dispersed. Our assessment reveals trade-offs and challenges in the food system that are easily overlooked in sectoral analyses of fisheries, aquaculture, health, medicine, human and fish welfare, safety and environment. We highlight potential benefits of an integrated, systematic and ongoing process to assess security of the aquatic food system and to predict impacts of social, economic and environmental change on food supply and demand.","[Jennings, Simon; Leocadio, Ana M.; Metcalfe, Julian D.; Pinnegar, John K.; Luisetti, Tiziana; Brown, Mary; Catchpole, Thomas L.; Clyne, Fiona J.; Dye, Stephen R.; Edmonds, Nathan J.; Hyder, Kieran; Lee, Janette; O'Brien, Carl M.; Posen, Paulette E.; Santos, Ana Ribeiro; Townhill, Bryony L.] Lowestoft Lab, Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England; [Jennings, Simon; Luisetti, Tiziana] Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Stentiford, Grant D.; Jeffery, Keith R.; Katsiadaki, Ioanna; Auchterlonie, Neil A.; Ellis, Tim; Peeler, Edmund J.; Baker-Austin, Craig; Lees, David N.; Morgan, Owen C.; Oidtmann, Birgit; Taylor, Nick G.

The high technological complexity together with the wide variety of AR devices require a high technological skill; on the other hand, evaluating their actual impacts on the manufacturing process is still an open question. Few recent studies have analysed this topic by using qualitative approaches based on an ex post analysis i.e. after the design and/or the adoption of the AR system - for evaluating the effectiveness of a developed AR application. The paper proposes an expert based tool for supporting production managers and researchers in effectively evaluating a preliminary ex ante feasibility analysis for assessing quantitatively most efficient single AR devices (or combinations) to be applied in specific manufacturing processes. A multi-criteria model based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method has been proposed to provide decision makers with quantitative knowledge for more efficiently designing AR applications in manufacturing. The model allows to integrate, in the same decision support tool, technical knowledge regarding AR devices with critical process features characterizing manufacturing processes, thus allowing to assess the contribution of the AR device in a wider prospective compared to current technological analyses. A test case study about the evaluation of AR system in on-site maintenance service is also discussed aiming to validate the model, and to outline its global applicability and potentialities. Obtained results highlighted the full efficacy of the proposed model in supporting ex-ante feasibility studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The research approach is to extract critical GM factors from field data, to evaluate those factors which have positive impact on the organisational performance and to develop a model linking both critical factors and performance measures. The research follows survey method for data collection. A diagnostic research survey instrument is designed and used for data collection from the Indian manufacturing companies that have implemented/experienced GM. Authors not only developed model but also attempted its optimisation, checked its robustness through sensitivity analysis and worked out its ability to predict patterns and possible trends through artificial neural network (ANN) simulation. Further, this model is validated through a case company data to work out its intensity and efficacy as a demonstrative application in reducing,environmental footprints. The major contribution of this study is in the identification, prioritisation of guiding factors, its modelling, and validation, which influence various manufacturing practices, and drastically affect organisational performance. The study offers useful insights and guides about how industries should link both aspects critical GM factors and performance measures to channelize their GM initiatives, in order to improve environmental, operational and financial performance.

Therefore, this work presents a new approach for the optimal planning under uncertainty for a biomass conversion system involving simultaneously economic and environmental issues. The environmental impact was measured via the Eco-indicator99 method and the economic aspect was determined through the net annual profit. The proposed method considered the uncertainty involved in the raw material price by the stochastic generation of scenarios using the Latin Hypercube method followed by the implementation of the Monte-Carlo method, where a deterministic optimization problem was solved for each single scenario to select the structure of the more robust supply chain relying on statistical data. The proposed approach was applied to a case study for a distributed biorefinery system in Mexico. The results showed that the behavior of the profit values for the stochastic case is not associated to the behavior of the raw material price; also, it is possible to observe that the supply chain topology could be affected for the uncertainty in the raw material price; however, the environmental and economic objectives did not present significant changes.

However, the supply chain of REE is subject to a complex set of technical, environmental, and geopolitical constraints. Some of these challenges may be circumvented if REE are recovered from naturally abundant alternative sources, such as saline waters and brines. Here, we synthesized and tested aminated silica gels, functionalized with 2 REE-reactive ligands: diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic dianhydride (DTPA-DA), phosphonoacetic acid (PAA), and N,N-bisphosphono(methyl)glycine (BPG). A suite of characterization techniques and batch adsorption experiments were used to evaluate the properties of the functionalized silica adsorbents and test the REE-uptake chemistry of the adsorbents under environmentally relevant conditions. Results showed that BPG and DTPADA yielded the most REE-reactive adsorbents of those tested. Moreover, the DTPADA adsorbents demonstrated chemical and physical robustness as well as ease of regeneration. However, as in previous studies, amino-poly(carboxylic acid) adsorbents showed limited uptake at midrange pH and low-sorbate concentrations. This work highlighted the complexity of intermolecular interactions between even moderately sized reactive sites when developing high-capacity, high-selectivity adsorbents. Additional development is required to implement an REE recovery scheme using these materials; however, it is clear that BPG- and DTPADA-based adsorbents offer a highly reactive adsorbent warranting further study.","[Noack, Clinton W.; Callura, Jonathan C.; Dzombak, David A.; Kararnalidis, Athanasios K.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 5000 Forbes Ave,Porter Hall 118, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Perkins, Kedar M.; Washburn, Newell R.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Chem, 4400 Fifth Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Kararnalidis, AK (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 5000 Forbes Ave,Porter Hall 118, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",akaramal@andrew.cmu.edu,"Callura, Jonathan C/O-1170-2017","Callura, Jonathan C/0000-0003-3807-0939; Perkins, Kedar/0000-0002-3232-2616","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-EE0006749]; CMU College of Engineering Dean's Fellowship; Hamerschlag University Professorship","This research was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, under contract DE-EE0006749.

While supply chain risk information plays a crucial role in the implementation and decisions of many of these activities, the importance of a firm's information processing capability to its supply chain risk management effort has received very little attention in the literature. Using information processing theory as the theoretical lens, we argue that a firm's capability in processing supply chain risk information, which comprises supply chain risk information sharing and supply chain risk information analysis, can improve operational performance, and this capability's effectiveness in improving performance is contingent on product-specific uncertainty characteristics (i.e., product complexity and product customization) and environment-related uncertainty characteristics (i.e., technology turbulence and market turbulence). We test the proposed theoretical model using data collected from 350 manufacturing firms in China. The results support that supply chain risk information processing capability comprises two constituent elements and has a positive effect on operational performance. The results also suggest that except for product complexity, all the other posited product-specific and environment-related uncertainty characteristics positively moderate the relationship between supply chain risk information capability and operational performance. We contribute to the literature by developing a theory-driven empirical model that integrates the core concepts of supply chain risk management and information processing theory to generate research findings with theoretical and managerial implications.","[Fan, Huan; Li, Gang] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian 710049, Peoples R China; [Fan, Huan; Li, Gang] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Mfg Syst Engn, Xian 710049, Peoples R China; [Fan, Huan; Li, Gang] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Key Lab, Minist Educ Proc Control & Efficiency Engn, Xian 710049, Peoples R China; [Fan, Huan; Cheng, T.

These surveys revealed common issues such as supply chain management, skilled personnel, logistical support and overall lack of quality standards. For sustainable improvements to health systems as well as global health security, deficiencies identified need to be actively corrected through robust quality assurance programmes and implementation of laboratory quality management systems. Given all the pathogens of public health importance, an external quality assessment programme with a focus on vaccine-preventable diseases and emerging and re-emerging dangerous pathogens is important, and should not be stand-alone, but integrated within laboratory networks as seen in polio, measles, yellow fever and rubella. In 2015, WHO AFRO collaborated with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and partners in a series of consultations with countries and national and regional EQA providers for the development of quality assurance models to support HIV point-of-care testing and monitoring. These consultations revealed similar challenges as seen in the WHO AFRO surveys. WHO AFRO brought forth its experience in implementing quality standards for health programmes, and also opened discussions on how lessons learned through such established programmes can be utilised to supporting and strengthening the introduction of early infant diagnosis of HIV and viral load point-of-care testing. An optimised external quality assessment programme will impact the ability of countries to meet core capacities, providing improved quality management systems, improving the confidence of diagnostic network services in Africa, and including capacities to detect events of international public health importance.","[Boeras, Debrah I.; Peeling, Rosanna W.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London, England; [Onyebujoh, Philip; Yahaya, Ali A.; Gumede-Moeletsi, Hieronyma N.; Ndihokubwayo, Jean B.] WHO, Reg Off Afr, Brazzaville, Rep Congo","Ndihokubwayo, JB (corresponding author), WHO, Reg Off Afr, Brazzaville, Rep Congo.",ndihokubwayoj@who.int,,,World Health OrganizationWorld Health Organization [001] Funding Source: Medline,,,6,4,4,1,5,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2225-2002,2225-2010,,AFR J LAB MED,Afr.

In a dual channel supply chain that includes traditional retailers and online e-tailers, consumer free riding often occurs when consumers enjoy the services provided by a traditional retailer but make purchases at a lower price from an e-tailer. The specific aim of this paper, therefore, is to evaluate the impact of consumer free riding on carbon emissions in a product's life cycle across a dual channel closed loop supply chain and to assess the effect of governmental e-commerce tax on carbon emissions. The study comprises a systematic comparison and numerical analysis of cases in which consumers do or do not free ride. Our results show that although manufacturers may gain economic benefits from consumer free riding behavior, total carbon emissions across the supply chain increase too, and a governmental tax on e-commerce can help reduce consumer free riding and total carbon emissions.

On the other hand, the supply chain manager drops sustainability objectives while coping with unexpected natural and man-made disruption risks. Hence, supply chain managers are now trying to develop sustainable supply chains that are simultaneously resilient enough to cope with disruption risks. Owing to the importance of the considered issue, this study proposed a network optimization model for a sustainable and resilient supply chain network by considering sustainability via embodied carbon footprints and carbon emissions and resilience by considering resilience index. In this paper, initially, a possibilistic fuzzy multi-objective sustainable and resilient supply chain network model is developed for the garment industry considering economic, sustainable, and resilience objectives. Secondly, a possibilistic fuzzy linguistic weight-based interactive solution method is proposed.

Network analysis (NA) can offer a broad framework of indicators to tackle this problem. In this article, we present a detailed analysis of a life cycle inventory (LCI) model from an NA perspective. Specifically, the network is represented as a directed graph and the emergy numeraire is used as the weight associated with the arcs of the network. The case study of a technological system for drinking water production is presented. We investigate the topological and structural characteristics of the network representation of this system and compare properties of its weighted and unweighted network, as well as the importance of nodes (i.e., life cycle unit processes). By identifying a number of advantages and limitations linked to the modeling complexity of such emergy-LCI networks, we classify the LCI technosphere network of our case study as a complex network belonging to the scale-free network family. The salient feature of this network family is represented by the presence of hubs: nodes that connect with many other nodes. Hub failures may imply relevant changes, decreases, or even breaks in the connectedness with other smaller hubs and nodes of the network. Hence, by identifying node centralities, we can rank and interpret the relevance of each node for its special role in the life cycle network.","[Navarrete-Gutierrez, Tomas; Rugani, Benedetto; Benetto, Enrico] LIST, Environm Res & Innovat ERIN Dept, RDI Unit Life Cycle Sustainabil & Risk Assessment, Belvaux, Luxembourg; [Navarrete-Gutierrez, Tomas; Rugani, Benedetto; Pigne, Yoann; Marvuglia, Antonino; Benetto, Enrico] Univ Havre, Le Havre, France","Rugani, B (corresponding author), LIST, Dept Environm Res & Innovat ERIN, 41 Rue Brill, L-4422 Belvaux, Luxembourg.",benedetto.rugani@list.lu,"Gutierrez, Tomas Navarrete/ABB-7811-2020; Marvuglia, Antonino/J-2595-2019; Rugani, Benedetto/E-8074-2017; Benetto, Enrico/H-3234-2012","Gutierrez, Tomas Navarrete/0000-0003-0525-4678; Rugani, Benedetto/0000-0002-3525-1382; Benetto, Enrico/0000-0003-1159-9162; Marvuglia, Antonino/0000-0002-8360-8040",,,,88,8,8,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

In order to propel this nascent industry one step further towards commercial viability, the present study expands the narrow outlook of previous studies which is restricted to a single location into a perspective with a nationwide network by proposing a sustainable supply chain model capable of revealing opportunities and limitations of algae industry's future. The proposed model is formulated based on batch and continuous production systems which completely cover the possible future configuration of microalgae-based biofuel supply chain and also offers managerial implications contributing to cost mitigation. Moreover, the uncertainty whose importance is accentuated in the case of algae production due to lack of real-world implementation is captured by the utilization of robust optimization under two norms of the uncertain data vector. A real case study is carried out to explore the applicability of the proposed model. Furthermore, robust sensitivity analysis technique is performed, allowing decision makers to analyze the effect of uncertain parameters on production cost based on their confidence levels.

Existing literature on the subject of supplier selection is focused on evaluating primary (e.g., cost, quality, lead time) and green (e.g., CO2 emission, environmental practices) criteria. However, the concept of supplier resilience has recently emerged due to advent of competitive and global supply chains (and the operational and disruptive risks to which they are exposed). Several resilience-based supplier selection criteria are developed with respect to absorptive, adaptive, and restorative capacities. This paper further proposes a Bayesian network (BN), a paradigm that effectively models the causal relationships among variables but that has not been used in the context of supplier evaluation and selection, to quantify the appropriateness of suppliers across primary, green, and resilience criteria. Some benefits of the BN paradigm, including an ability to handle expert evidence and to perform sensitivity and propagation analyses, are demonstrated with an initial illustrative example of three suppliers.

These tools must support the analysis with accurate results, but they must also be fast and easy enough to be used use in a complex practical setting. In this paper we present and discuss a deterministic single-period single-sourcing LP/MIP based method that the Linde Group has used for more than 100 projects for optimising the logistic network in the air-gas cylinder business. The model, called CSS (cylinder supply structure), includes a multi-echelon logistic network with transportation between plants and warehouses and distribution to several end-customers. The model allows deliveries to customers from all echelons in the supply network. Both the downstream flow of full cylinders and the upstream return of empty cylinders are included in the model. In general, more than 75 % of the total transportation- and distribution costs are caused by the final distribution to customers in a supply network as above. This paper will in particular analyse the distribution part of this model; how it is designed and how the cost is estimated. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the method we use empirical data to compare the model results with empirical results. The results showed that from the beginning the model overestimated the expected distances and costs for the distribution. With a rework and improved method to estimate the distribution cost, the model significantly improved its accuracy.","[Samuelsson, Bjorn] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Ind Logist, S-95187 Lulea, Sweden","Samuelsson, B (corresponding author), Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Ind Logist, S-95187 Lulea, Sweden.",bjorn.1.samuelsson@ltu.se,,,,,,14,5,5,0,21,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1109-2858,1866-1505,,OPER RES-GER,Oper.

The cash flow and budgeting model will be coupled with supply chain network design using a mixed integer linear programming formulation. The article evaluates two financial criteria, that is, the change in equity and the profit as objective functions. The results indicate that objective functions are partially interdependent, that is, they conflict in certain parts. This fact illustrates the inadequacy of treating process operations and finances in isolated environments and pursuing objective myopic performance indicators such as profit or cost. Due to the importance of the supply chain network design problem, a multi-objective robust optimization with the max-min version is extended to cope with the uncertainty. A solution approach integrating Benders' decomposition method with the scenario relaxation algorithm is also proposed in this research. The improved algorithm has been applied to solve a number of numerical experiments. All results illustrate significant improvement in computation time of the improved algorithm over existing approaches. For a problem, the proposed algorithm shows a significant reduction in computational time compared with the Benders' decomposition and scenario relaxation that shows the efficiency of the proposed solution method.","[Ramezani, Majid; Kimiagari, Ali Mohammad] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Management Syst, Tehran Polytech, Tehran, Iran","Kimiagari, AM (corresponding author), Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran Polytech, 424 Hafez Ave,POB 15875-4413, Tehran, Iran.",kimiagar@aut.ac.ir,,,,,,34,2,2,2,58,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0954-4054,2041-2975,,P I MECH ENG B-J ENG,Proc.

The social sustainability mostly advocates the people's welfare, health, safety, and quality of life. In the agricultural food industry, the aspects of social sustainability, such as consumer health and safety have gained substantial attention due to the frequent cases of food-borne diseases. The food-borne diseases due to the food degradation, chemical contamination and adulteration of food products pose a serious threat to the consumer's health, safety, and quality of life. To ensure the consumer's health and safety, it is essential to develop an efficient system which can address these critical social issues in the food distribution networks. This research proposes an ePedigree (electronic pedigree) traceability system based on the integration of RFID and sensor technology for real-time monitoring of the agricultural food to prevent the distribution of hazardous and adulterated food products.

The objective function of the model is to minimize the total cost of the supply chain network by determining a set of best suppliers, order allocation to selected suppliers, the location of facilities in each layer and transportation quantities between them. Moreover, to measure the imprecise input parameters, according to three types of uncertainty sets, the robust counterparts of the model have been developed.

To survive in a highly competitive industry, strategies to either collaborate or compete with rival firms within a network should be considered in the new product development process, and it is crucial to pay great attention to customers' needs and interests. Considering the imprecise nature of some critical parameters plays an important role in making suitable strategic decisions. This fact requires considering uncertainties of the environment such as customer demands and supplier capacities. In this study, a supply chain involving multiple suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and customers and addressing a multi-objective, multi-period and multi-product aggregate procurement and production planning problem is considered. The first objective function aims to maximize the profit of the supply chain, including that associated with new product development. The second objective function considers customer satisfaction, and the third one maximizes the production of the developed and new products. To address real-world planning problems involving noisy, incomplete or erroneous data, the supplier capacity parameters of the supply chain and demand fluctuations are subject to uncertainty, which is modeled by fuzzy stochastic programming. Finally, the proposed multi-objective model is solved as a single-objective mixed integer programming model by applying the revised multi-choice goal programming method. In addition, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Reverse logistics (RL) has been considered as a systematic approach for industries to improve their environmental impacts and to ensure sustainability in business. Industries are enthusiastic to adopt RL activities in their businesses, but they also face challenges such as insufficient knowledge and resources regarding RL implementation. Therefore, we seek to evaluate the critical success factors (CSFs) linked to the implementation of RL in manufacturing industries in India. In this work, a structural model is proposed by using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methods to evaluate the CSFs in RL adoption. The AHP methodology assists in establishing the priorities of the CSFs, while the DEMATEL approach categorizes the causal relationships among them. The findings of this work shows that the Global competitiveness main factor is highly prioritized, and thus, needs to be focused greatly in order to increase the effectiveness of RL adoption in business. The relative priority of the remaining main factors through AHP analysis is given as Regulatory factors- HR and organizational factors-Economic factors- Strategic factors. The findings also indicate that Global competitiveness; Regulatory; HR and organizational main factors are classified under cause group, while Economic and Strategic main factors belong to effect group. This model will help business analysts and supply chain managers formulate both short-term and long-term, flexible decision strategies for successfully managing and implementing RL adoption in the supply chain scenarios.

First, a robust multi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming model is proposed to deal with ECLSC considering two conflicting objectives simultaneously, as well as the uncertain nature of the supply chain. Cost parameters of the supply chain and demand fluctuations are subject to uncertainty. The first objective function aims to minimize the economical cost and the second objective function is to minimize the environmental influence.

A business begins or expands by establishing new facilities, so selecting a facility location is a strategic and crucial decision. In the context of sustainability, the selection of location for different facilities can be a critical problem, especially for manufacturing firms that endorse the wide footprint of Extended Producer Responsibility policies. This study aims at prioritizing alternative potential locations for manufacturing firms with respect to the three dimensions of sustainability identified above. The three dimensions are assessed by factors obtained through a factor analysis and are grouped by corresponding invariable sub criteria. These sub criteria are chosen from the extant literature review. Then, the preferred order of alternative potential location is obtained by Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) based on each location's overall performance. The performance of each alternative potential location is assessed on the basis of overall weights of alternatives, evaluating factors, and triple bottom line attributes, which were obtained by Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). The multi criteria decision making technique, AHP, calculates the weights of the qualitative and quantitative criteria impacting the location selection problem. Then the approach of the study is validated by applying a case from real life; the results are justified by completing a sensitivity analysis on the relative importance weights of the three primary attributes (economical, environmental, and social). The results of the sensitivity analysis demonstrate an effective decision making technique for the optimal selection of sustainable manufacturing locations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The challenge is to come up with a method that can adapt to most possible environments without straying too far from the optimal solution. Our approach is based on the generation of scenarios that correspond to combinations of uncertain parameters within the model. The performance of designs resulting from these scenario optimizations are compared to the performance of each of the other design scenarios, based on their probability of occurrence.

DNCSs are defined as the networked control systems (NCSs) consist of several sub-systems. Each sub-system contains its own sensor, controller and actuator. This kind of systems widely exist in the real world, such as the urban water supply network, smart grid and so on. Three main aspects of DNSCs are investigated in this paper. Firstly, we consider the variable structure problem of DNCSs. Meanwhile, the network problems including time delays, packet-dropouts and quantization errors are considered. Finally, the actuator fault tolerant control problem due to the possible poor working environment is also studied. A series of two-mode-dependent controllers are proposed to stabilize such DNCSs and meet the robust closed loop performance. By using the Lyapunov Krasovskii (L-K) function, sufficient conditions on the existence of such controllers are presented in terms of bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs). A cone complementarity linearization (CCL) algorithm is given to solve proposed BMIs. Finally, a simulation example is exploited to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The sheer magnitude of daily transactions makes it inevitable that there will be disruptions, further exacerbated by differences in cultural norms and attitudes that add a layer of complexity to managerial response. In this research, we examine the impact of national culture on individuals' responses to supply disruptions due to psychological contract breach. Using data from controlled experiments conducted with 158 subjects in China and 125 subjects in the U.S., we evaluate changes in decision-making behaviors and assessments of attitudinal outcomes regarding trust and repurchase intentions. Our results show post-breach behavioral differences based on national culture, but find that these differences are short-term in nature. Additionally, cultural differences show up in both of the attitudinal outcomes assessed in this research. Following a psychological contract breach, individuals from the U.S. express less trust in their supply chain partner and less willingness to work with that partner again in the future as compared to individuals from China. Our research suggests that managers and scholars interested in the cultural influences on the response to supply disruption will benefit from further research and understanding focusing on the intersection of psychological contract breach and cultural distance.","[Eckerd, Stephanie] Univ Tennessee, Haslam Coll Business, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Eckerd, Stephanie] Univ Tennessee, Courses Supply Chain Management, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Boyer, Kenneth K.] Ohio State Univ, Operat Management, Fisher Coll Business, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Boyer, Kenneth K.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Management Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Qi, Yinan] Univ Int Business & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Eckerd, Adam] Univ Tennessee, Polit Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Hill, James A.] Ohio State Univ, Management Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Eckerd, S (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Haslam Coll Business, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.; Eckerd, S (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Courses Supply Chain Management, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",,,"Qi, Yinan/0000-0003-1527-3063",Scientific Research Project Achievement of the Collaborative Innovation Center for China's Multinational Enterprise [201501YY002B],This research was supported by the Scientific Research Project Achievement of the Collaborative Innovation Center for China's Multinational Enterprise (No. 201501YY002B).,,77,23,23,2,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1523-2409,1745-493X,,J SUPPLY CHAIN MANAG,J.

In this paper, a multi period, multi product, multi echelon and capacitated supply chain problem for short lifetime products was solved using both exact method and metaheuristic algorithms. The considered echelons in a forward/reverse supply chain network design include suppliers, hybrid production-inspection centers, hybrid warehouse-collection centers, retailers, disposal centers and recovery centers. To tackle both strategic and tactical nature of the problem and due to its complexity, the location problem is first solved using an exact method in which strategic decisions are made aiming to minimize the location costs. Then the allocation problem is solved using both exact and metaheuristic algorithms, namely Tabu Search and Differential Evolution, in which based on the results obtained from the location problem, the profit is maximized and tactical decisions are made. A cyclic feedback procedure is proposed in between the location and allocation models to obtain the best solution. The allocation model is linearized using a new method and to handle the uncertainty, a robust mixed integer programming model is developed which can retain the linearity of the model. The computational results confirm the effectiveness of the exact method for the location problem while testifies the proposed algorithms can obtain effective solutions compared with that of the exact solutions for the allocation problem in both deterministic and uncertain environment. In addition, the results show that in terms of preciseness and convergence, the proposed Differential Evolution algorithm outperforms the other algorithm. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To date, a number of researchers have argued that intensive transportation activities through popular distribution strategies such as Just-In-Time (JIT) could significantly increase carbon emissions within logistics chains. However, a systematic understanding of how JIT distribution affects carbon emissions is still lacking in current literature. In this study, we develop a bi-objective optimization model for a carbon-capped JIT distribution of multiple products in a multi-period and multi-echelon distribution network. The aims are to jointly minimize total logistics cost and to minimize the maximum carbon quota allowed per period (carbon cap). The considered problem is investigated under three different carbon emission constraints namely periodic, cumulative and global. Since the studied problem is NP-Hard, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is developed and its parameters are tuned by Taguchi method. For further quality improvement of the developed solution approach, a novel local search approach called modified firefly algorithm incorporates NSGA-II. Different sizes of the problem are considered to compare the performances of the proposed hybrid NSGA-II and the classical one. Finally, the results are presented along with some policy and managerial insights. For policy makers, the findings show the impact of varying the carbon emission cap on total cost and total emissions under JIT distribution concept. From managerial perspectives, we analyze the relationships between average inventory holding and backlog level per period which can assist mangers to identify critical decisions for JIT distribution of products in carbon-capped environment.

These practices require the introduction of environment-friendly equipment and facilities not only by shipowners, but also by other supply chain players who control critical complementary assets. In particular, these assets, whose nature is both specialized and cospecialized, are those where there is respectively unilateral or bilateral dependence between innovation and complementary assets. This study deals with the role of complementary know-how and assets in the development of green shipping practices by container shipping companies. The research is conducted utilizing a multiple case-study analysis based on leading container shipping companies involved in cooperative networks. The main findings unveil that the implementation of successful green shipping practices not only requires the operational integration of green attitudes/technologies among supply chain players, but also the strategic coordination among them.","[Ferretti, Marco; Risitano, Marcello; Tutore, Ilaria] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Management Studies & Quantitat Methods, Via Gen Parisi 13, Naples, Italy; [Parola, Francesco] Univ Genoa, Dept Econ & Business, Via Francesco Vivaldi 5, Genoa, Italy","Ferretti, M (corresponding author), Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Management Studies & Quantitat Methods, Via Gen Parisi 13, Naples, Italy.",marco.ferret-ti@uniparthenope.it; parola@economia.unige.it; marcello.risitano@uniparthenope.it; tutore@uniparthenope.it,"Tutore, Ilaria/AAL-3840-2020; Ferretti, Marco/ABI-2417-2020; jam, amir/O-6460-2019","Tutore, Ilaria/0000-0002-3520-1449; Risitano, Marcello/0000-0001-9579-5931",,,,38,3,3,0,13,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX  NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

For small farms, the unsustainability of the food system is even more serious; farms' declining share of profit and the cost-price squeeze of commodity production has increased barriers to market access with the inevitable effect of agricultural abandonment. One way forward to respond to the existing conventional agri-food systems and to create a competitive or survival strategy for small family farms is the re-construction of regional and local agri-food systems, aligning with Kramer and Porter's concept of shared value strategy. Through a critical literature review, this paper presents regional and local food hubs as innovative organizational arrangements capable of bridging structural holes in the agri-food markets between small producers and the consumers-individuals and families as well as big buyers. Food hubs respond to a supply chain (or supply network) organizational strategy aiming at re-territorialising the agri-food systems through the construction of what in the economic literature are defined as values-based food supply chains.","[Berti, Giaime; Mulligan, Catherine] Imperial Coll, Sch Business, Innovat & Entrepreneurship Grp, London SW7 2AZ, England","Berti, G (corresponding author), Imperial Coll, Sch Business, Innovat & Entrepreneurship Grp, London SW7 2AZ, England.",g.berti@imperial.ac.uk; c.mulligan@imperial.ac.uk,,"Berti, Giaime/0000-0001-7457-9236",Scaling the Rural Enterprise [EP/J000604/2]; Digital Economy Sustainable Society Network+ [EP/K003593/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/J000604/2] Funding Source: researchfish,"We acknowledge support from, Scaling the Rural Enterprise (EP/J000604/2) and Digital Economy Sustainable Society Network+ (EP/K003593/1) in the development of this paper.

The approach is explorative with a cross sectional design that takes advantage of ten case studies out of selected logistics service providers (LSPs) operating primarily in the Scandinavian countries. The findings illustrate the major themes by analyzing current and future activities in developing environmentally sustainable logistical activities. In addition, four categories of challenges are identified: customer priorities, managerial complexity, network imbalance, and technological and legislative uncertainties. It is concluded that there is a great need for a holistic perspective where LSPs and product owners together analyze and design future logistical setups. The suggested holistic and integrative model, building on a three-dimensional concurrent engineering framework, provides new opportunities for research. Further research is needed to improve the interrelationship between LSPs and their customers in the development of sustainable logistical solutions. This paper puts forward recommendations for the sustainable development of logistics by combining the results from the case studies with a review of related literature. This will be beneficial for managers and policy makers when they approach sustainable logistical challenges. The emergence and synthesis of themes and challenges are critical for a sustainable society. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In 1961, Salers cheese producers created a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO). To preserve the distinctive character of their product, they opted to require use of the gerle, a traditional wooden vat, and an on-farm cheese making process. The gerle came recently under scrutiny from French governmental hygiene regulation enforcement, and the subsequent public controversy jeopardized the entire supply chain and destabilized Salers cheese-making methods. Prevailing in their efforts to protect Salers, producers established the gerle as mandatory and have since set up a governance board to ensure PDO brand integrity. Our analysis suggests that the diversity of technical choices and associated set of knowledge in Salers cheese production has paradoxically been both its strength and weakness. Local agricultural know-how forges links among participants in Salers networks, connecting cheese producers and consumers, to cattle, microbes, landscapes, wooden tools, and cheeses. Yet, diversity of local expertise creates a tension among producers who must collaborate to achieve unified standards within a PDO while resisting homogeneity. Such results contribute to discussing on PDO governance: an arena to share, compare, and unite local knowledge is critical for GI and thus for sustainable agricultural systems.","[Berard, Laurence] CNRS Ressources Terroirs, F-01000 Bourg En Bresse, France; [Casabianca, Francois; Bouche, Remi] INRA SAD, Lab Rech Dev Elevage, F-20250 Corte, France; [Montel, Marie-Christine] INRA, Unite Rech Fromageres, F-15000 Aurillac, France; [Agabriel, Claire] VETAGRO SUP, Campus Clermont Ferrand, F-63370 Lempdes, France","Berard, L (corresponding author), CNRS Ressources Terroirs, F-01000 Bourg En Bresse, France.",laurence.berard@ethno-terroirs.cnrs.fr; casabianca@corte.inra.fr; cmontel@clermont.inra.fr; c.agabriel@vetagro-sup.fr,,,ANR (The French National Research Agency) as part of the Agriculture et Developpement Durable programFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-05-PADD-012],"This work was carried out with the financial support of the ANR (The French National Research Agency) as part of the Agriculture et Developpement Durable program, in the project ANR-05-PADD-012, Promotion du developpement durable par les indications geographiques.

Since 2006, the private firms that buy and trade soybeans globally have assumed a key role in ensuring that soy producers comply with forest protection policies, including the Soy Moratorium and public policies banning the use of illegally deforested land. We used evidence from field interviews and a GIS of property boundaries and soy-production areas to describe the private sector governance process and to characterize the variety of property arrangements underlying soy production in Mato Grosso, the leading soy-producing state in the Brazilian Amazon. These increasingly complex property arrangements include ownership of multiple properties by a single producer, use of rental properties owned by others, and soy and cattle production on a single property. This complexity could create loopholes allowing soy associated with deforestation to enter the supply chain. Comprehensive soy-governance strategies that include more robust procedures for verifying the provenance of soy across all properties, that account for the entire property rather than only the area planted to soy, and that use more transparent verification systems could achieve greater reductions in deforestation.","[Rausch, Lisa L.; Gibbs, Holly K.] Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Sustainabil & Global Environm SAGE, 1710 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53726 USA; [Gibbs, Holly K.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geog, 550 N Pk St, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Rausch, LL (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Sustainabil & Global Environm SAGE, 1710 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53726 USA.",llrausch@wisc.edu; hkgibbs@wisc.edu,,"Rausch, Lisa/0000-0001-6500-588X",Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation's Department for Civil Society under the Norwegian Forest and Climate Initiative,"The authors are grateful to Jessica L'Roe, Annabel Ipsen, Ian Schelly, Matthew Christie, Jacob Munger, Fanny Moffette, and Tyler Lark for their discussion and insightful suggestions on previous versions of this manuscript, and to three anonymous reviewers whose comments greatly improved the final version.

An intelligent contingency plan, rather than a direct and constant back-up plan, is more suitable for flexible and effective management. In this research, we introduce a unique contingent multi-sourcing decision protocol for effective response when disruptions occur. It is called the Intelligent Contingent Sourcing (ICS) protocol. Unlike previous research, which has mostly considered the constant multi-sourcing(1) among internal suppliers, our model is developed for contingent multi-sourcing by collaboration with external suppliers. (When both the supplier and buyer are managed controlled by the same company, that supplier is considered an internal supplier; in case each supplier is independent in terms of buyers and is self-interested, such supplier is considered an external supplier). Such contingent multi-sourcing requires the theoretical analysis of each participant's economic aspect, because each external supplier is independent and thus self-interested. The ICS protocol forms a contingent collaborative coalition based on a distributed decision making process. To evaluate the performance of the ICS protocol, three sourcing models are compared: (1) Single sourcing, (2) Constant multi-sourcing, and (3) Contingent multi-sourcing by the ICS protocol. Statistical analysis reveals that, with statistical significance, the ICS protocol performs at least equal to or better than single sourcing, in terms of less lost sales and less total costs; ICS protocol also outperforms constant multi-sourcing under specific conditions (stated in the article).

The planning model focuses primarily on integrating the quantitative and qualitative risk factors associated with strategic production network planning. Integration was realized by linking a robust programming model with aspects of multi-target optimization using an EPSILON constraint approach. This allows quantitative risks such as fluctuations in demand, exchange rates, and transportation costs to be factored into a common mixed-integer optimization model as discrete scenarios, with qualitative risks, e.g., security risks, accounted for as part of a points-based evaluation approach. The developed model minimizes the firm's expected downside risk exposure while meeting a pre-selected threshold level for environmental risks. The trade-off between risk and profit is depicted and interpreted using a Pareto analysis. The developed model makes it possible to characterize a variety of risks that are very difficult to manage when carrying out strategic planning of production networks in practice.

However, the RFID coverage performance is largely impacted by the surrounding environment and potential collisions between the RFID devices. Thus, through RFID network planning (RNP) to achieve the desired coverage within the budget becomes a key factor for success. In this study, we establish a novel and generic multi-objective RNP model by simultaneously optimising two conflicted objectives with satisfying the heterogeneous coverage requirements. Then, we design an improved multi-objective genetic algorithm (IMOGA) integrating a divide-and-conquer greedy heuristic algorithm to solve the model. We further construct a number of computational cases abstracted from an automobile mixed-model assembly line to illustrate how the proposed model and algorithm are applied in a real RNP application. The results show that the proposed IMOGA achieves highly competitive solutions compared with Pareto optimal solutions and the solutions given by four recently developed well-known multi-objective evolutionary and swarm-based optimisers (SPEA2, NSGA-II, MOPSO and (MOPSO)-O-2) in terms of solution quality and computational robustness.","[Tang, Lin; Zheng, Li; Cao, Hui] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Huang, Ningjian] Gen Motors R&D, Mfg Syst Res Lab, Warren, MI USA","Zheng, L (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",lzheng@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation, ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71301084, 71332005]; General Motors Company","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation, China [grant number 71301084], [grant number 71332005]; General Motors Company.",,37,6,6,4,36,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

Hence, the evaluation and selection of the right suppliers have become a central decision of manufacturing business activities around the world. Consequently, numerous individual and integrated methods have been presented to evaluate and select suppliers. The current literature shows that hybrid artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have received much attention for supplier evaluation. Integrated data envelopment analysis-artificial neural network (DEA-ANN) is one of the combined methods that have recently garnered great attention from academics and practitioners. However, DEA-ANN model has some drawbacks, which make some limitation in the evaluation process. In this study, we aim at improving the previous DEA-AI models by integrating the Kourosh and Arash method as a robust model of DEA with a new AI approach namely genetic programming (GP) to overcome the shortcomings of previous DEA-AI models in supplier selection. Indeed, in this paper, GP provides a robust nonlinear mathematical equation for the suppliers' efficiency using the determined criteria. To validate the model, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system as a powerful tool was used to compare the result with GP-based model. In addition, parametric analysis and unseen data set were used to validate the precision of the model.","[Fallahpour, Alireza; Olugu, Ezutah Udoncy; Musa, Siti Nurmaya] Univ Malaya, Dept Mech Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Khezrimotlagh, Dariush] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm Bldg, Dept Appl Stat, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Wong, Kuan Yew] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Mfg & Ind Engn, Skudai 81310, Malaysia","Olugu, EU (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Dept Mech Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",fallahpour.a@gmail.com; olugu@um.edu.my; nurmaya@um.edu.my; dariush@um.edu.my; wongky@fkm.utm.my,"Wong, Kuan Yew/D-1577-2010; Musa, S.

Following this need the present paper studies the supply chain design and planning problem and proposes an optimization model to support the associated decisions. The proposed model is a Mixed Integer Linear Multi-objective Programming model, which is solved through a Simulated Annealing based multi-objective meta-heuristics algorithm - MBSA. The proposed algorithm defines the location and capacities of the supply chain entities (factories, warehouses and distribution centers) chooses the technologies to be installed in each production facility and defines the inventory profiles and material flows during the planning time horizon. Profit maximization and environmental impacts minimization are considered. The algorithm, MBSA, explores the feasible solution space using a new Local Search strategy with a Multi-Start mechanism. The performance of the proposed methodology is compared with an exact approach supported by a Pareto Frontier and as main conclusions it can be stated that the proposed algorithm proves to be very efficient when solving this type of complex problems. Several Key Performance Indicators are developed to validate the algorithm robustiveness and, in addition, the proposed approach is validated through the solution of several instances.

ISM is employed to model the relationship among the various enablers. Sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the influences of dimensions, criteria, and alternatives scores on the stability of the ranking results. The results of our study demonstrate that governmental regulations, rewards and incentives, and listening to the views of the customers are the main enablers that can achieve sustainability in supply chains.

Some of these criteria may have imprecise and uncertain data which make the location selection decision hard to progress. Although many multi attribute decision making (MADM) techniques are utilized in location decision study field, there is a lack of studies which provide solutions by considering high number of supply chain uncertainties. In this study, against the drawbacks of traditional MADM techniques, a novel MADM approach is applied for location decision under high uncertainty as a first time. In the proposed model, a new notion named as cloud based design optimization (CBDO) is utilized because CBDO can take into consideration certain and uncertain factors simultaneously. Furthermore, it provides robust solution within worst case scenario to existing approaches by mediating between aspects of fuzzy set theory and probability distributions. Robustness enables decision makers have managerial and operational foresights about possible unexpected situations, and take necessary actions against risk. An illustrative example is conducted in warehouse location selection problem area to indicate the performance of the proposed approach. It is revealed out that location decision is very sensitive to the consideration of uncertainty and CBDO can be a helpful supportive tool for decision makers in providing solution under high uncertainty.

We propose a novel profit maximization model for CLSCN design as a mixedinteger linear program in which there is flexibility in covering the proportions of demand satisfied and returns collected based on the firm's policies. Our major contribution is to develop a novel hybrid robust-stochastic programming (HRSP) approach to simultaneously model two different types of uncertainties by including stochastic scenarios for transportation costs and polyhedral uncertainty sets for demands and returns. Transportation cost scenarios are generated using a Latin Hypercube Sampling method and scenario reduction is applied to consolidate them. An accelerated stochastic Benders decomposition algorithm is proposed for solving this model. To speed up the convergence of this algorithm, valid inequalities are introduced to improve the lower bound quality, and also a Pareto-optimal cut generation scheme is used to strengthen the Benders optimality cuts. Numerical studies are performed to verify our mathematical formulation and also demonstrate the benefits of the HRSP approach. The performance improvements achieved by the valid inequalities and Pareto-optimal cuts are demonstrated in randomly generated instances.

In addition to those sectors as important environmental pressure producers or drivers, there exist sectors that are also important to environmental pressure mitigation as transmission centers. Economy-wide environmental pressure mitigation might be achieved by improving production efficiency of these key transmission sectors, that is, using less upstream inputs to produce unitary output. We develop a betweenness-based method to measure the importance of transmission sectors, borrowing the betweenness concept from network analysis. We quantify the betweenness of sectors by examining supply chain paths extracted from structural path analysis that pass through a particular sector. We take China as an example and find that those critical transmission sectors identified by betweenness-based method are not always identifiable by existing methods. This indicates that betweenness-based method can provide additional insights that cannot be obtained with existing methods on the roles individual sectors play in generating economy-wide environmental pressures. Betweenness-based method proposed here can therefore complement existing methods for guiding sector-level environmental pressure mitigation strategies.","[Liang, Sai; Qu, Shen; Xu, Ming] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Xu, Ming] Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Xu, M (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.; Xu, M (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",mingxu@umich.edu,"Xu, Ming/F-3653-2010","Xu, Ming/0000-0002-7106-8390; Liang, Sai/0000-0002-6306-5800","U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [1438197]; Dow Sustainability Fellows Program; Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp SysNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG) [1438197] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","The material is based upon work supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant No. 1438197.

Seaports are no exception. As complex clusters of industrial activity and gateways for distribution networks, they are vulnerable to external and internal shocks disrupting supply chains. This evolution forces stakeholders to ponder on sustainable development, and to foster adaptive capabilities and create opportunities. The development and further substantiation of the notion of 'resilience' underlined the need to study how clusters and networks (should) respond to major disturbances. In this paper, we scrutinize the concept of port resilience by revisiting the Panarchy and adaptive cycle theorem of Holling (2001). The objective is to determine if this framework can be applied to a port development context. The paper outlines the literature on Panarchy and adaptive cycles and links it to ports. It also provides an overview of the general theorem and explains the value for maritime research. The framework is linked to a set of cases on port infrastructure and development.

In low-income countries, resources to assist the injured in a timely fashion may be limited. As a consequence, necrosis and wound infection in disaster patients is common and frequently leads to adverse health outcomes such as amputations, chronic wounds, and loss of life. In such compromised health care environments, low-tech and cheap wound care options are required that are in ready supply, easy to use, and have multiple therapeutic benefits. Maggot debridement therapy (MDT) is one such wound care option and may prove to be an invaluable tool in the treatment of wounds post-disaster. Discussion: This report provides an overview of the wound burden experienced in various types of disaster, followed by a discussion of current treatment approaches, and the role MDT may play in the treatment of complex wounds in challenging health care conditions. Maggot debridement therapy removes necrotic and devitalized tissue, controls wound infection, and stimulates wound healing. These properties suggest that medicinal maggots could assist health care professionals in the debridement of disaster wounds, to control or prevent infection, and to prepare the wound bed for reconstructive surgery. Maggot debridement therapy-assisted wound care would be led by health care workers rather than physicians, which would allow the latter to focus on reconstructive and other surgical interventions. Moreover, MDT could provide a larger window for time-critical interventions, such as fasciotomies to treat compartment syndrome and amputations in case of life-threatening wound infection. Recommendations: There are social, medical, and logistic hurdles to overcome before MDT can become widely available in disaster medical aid. Thus, research is needed to further demonstrate the utility of MDT in Disaster Medicine. There is also a need for reliable MDT logistics and supply chain networks. Integration with other disaster management activities will also be essential. Conclusions: In the aftermath of disasters, MDT could play an important role facilitating timely and efficient medical treatment and improving patient outcomes. Existing social, medical, and logistic barriers will need to be overcome for MDT to be mainstreamed in Disaster Medicine.","[Stadler, Frank; Tatham, Peter] Griffith Univ, Dept Int Business & Asian Studies, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Shaban, Ramon Z.] Griffith Univ, Menzies Hlth Inst Queensland, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Shaban, Ramon Z.] Gold Coast Univ Hosp & Hlth Serv, Dept Infect Control & Infect Dis, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia","Stadler, F (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Dept Int Business & Asian Studies, Gold Coast Campus, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia.",f.stadler@griffith.edu.au,,,,,,85,1,2,1,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1049-023X,1945-1938,,PREHOSP DISASTER MED,Prehospital Disaster Med.,FEB,2016,31,1,,,,,79,84,,10.1017/S1049023X15005427,,,6,Emergency Medicine,Emergency Medicine,DG2AV,WOS:000371869500012,26648417,,,,2021-03-04

During the recent years, the closed-loop green supply chain management has been increasingly a center of attention as a result of governmental laws and legislations (regarding the environmental effects of any activity) and the soaring consumers' expectations. In this study, effort has been made to investigate a facility location/allocation model for a multi-product closed-loop green supply chain network consisting of manufacturing/remanufacturing and collection/inspection centers as well as disposal center and markets. To design the network, we have proposed a mixed-integer linear programming model capable of reducing the network total costs. The model has been so developed as to consider such environmental objectives as reducing the rate of carbon dioxide emission in the environment throughout the network in question. Moreover, the model has been developed using a robust fuzzy programming approach to investigate the effects of uncertainties of the variable costs, as well as the demand rate, on the network design. To solve the bi-objective programming model, use has been made of the e-constraint approach and a numerical illustration of Copiers Industry is used to show the applicability of the proposed optimization model. Results have revealed that the model is capable of controlling the network uncertainties as a result of which a robustness price will be imposed on the system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Partner selection is a critical activity in constructing a green supply chain because the environmental performance of the whole supply chain is significantly affected by all its constituents. The paper presents a model for green partner selection and supply chain construction by combining analytic network process (ANP) and multi-objective programming (MOP) methodologies. The model offers a new way of solving the green partner selection and supply chain construction problem both effectively and efficiently as it enables decision-makers to simultaneously minimize the negative environmental impact of the supply chain whilst maximizing its business performance. The paper also develops an additional decision-making tool in the form of the environmental difference, the business difference and the eco-efficiency ratio which quantify the trade-offs between environmental and business performance. The applicability and practicability of the model is demonstrated in an illustration of its use in the Chinese electrical appliance and equipment manufacturing industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Sustainability is integrated in the form of supplier sustainability ratings and sustainable supplier development through investment and training budgets. To handle the considerable complexity concerning such decisions, we demonstrate a recent algorithmic approach that can identify a portfolio (set) of multiple high-quality and yet collectively diverse solutions.

Eco-indicator 99, which is a well-known life-cycle-assessment- (LCA-) based environmental impact assessment method, is incorporated into the model to estimate the relevant environmental impacts. To handle the inherent uncertainty of the input data in the problem of interest, a novel multiobjective robust possibilistic programming (MORPP) approach is developed.

Temperate-zone agroecological systems that are currently organized for production of summer-annual crops can be diversified by integration of fallow-season and perennial crops. Integration of such crops can improve sustainability of these agroecological systems, with minimal interference with current agricultural production. Importantly, these crops can provide feedstocks for a wide range of new bio-products that are forming a new agricultural bioeconomy, potentially providing greatly increased economic incentives for diversification. However, while there are many fallow-season and perennial crops that might be used in such a bioeconomic strategy for diversification, most are not yet well adapted and highly-marketable. Efforts are underway to enhance adaptation and marketability of many such crops. Critically, these efforts require a strategic approach that addresses the inherent complexity of these projects. We outline a suitable approach, which we term sustainable commercialization: a coordinated innovation process that integrates a new crop into the agriculture of a region, while intentionally addressing economic, environmental and social sustainability challenges via multi-stakeholder governance. This approach centers on a concerted effort to coordinate and govern innovation in three critical areas: germplasm development, multifunctional agroecosystem design and management, and development of end uses, supply chains, and markets. To exemplify the approach, we describe an ongoing effort to commercialize a new fallow-season crop, field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.).","[Jordan, N. R.; Ewing, P.; Williams, A.; Anderson, K.

A two-stage mixed-integer programming model is used to develop a flexible sourcing strategy under disruptions. Our model integrates supplier selection and demand allocation with transportation channel selection and provides contingency plans to mitigate the negative impacts of disruptions and minimise total network costs. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the model and provide insights. The findings suggest that developing contingency plans using flexibility in suppliers' production capacity is an effective strategy for firms to mitigate the severity of disruptions. We also show that flexibility and reliability of the suppliers and regions play a significant role in determining contingency plans for during disruption. Findings generally show that highly flexible suppliers receive less allocation, and their flexible capacity is reserved for disruptions. For firms that do not incorporate risk management into supplier selection and allocation, the recommendation is to source from fewer, more reliable suppliers with less risk of disruption. Our findings also emphasise that the type of disruption has important implications for supplier selection and demand allocation. This study highlights the supply chain risk management strategy of regionalising as a means for minimising the impact of environmental disruptions.","[Kamalahmadi, Masoud] N Carolina Agr & Tech State Univ, Sch Technol, Greensboro, NC 27411 USA; [Mellat-Parast, Mahour] N Carolina Agr & Tech State Univ, Technol Management, Greensboro, NC 27411 USA","Mellat-Parast, M (corresponding author), N Carolina Agr & Tech State Univ, Technol Management, Greensboro, NC 27411 USA.",mahour@ncat.edu,"Parast, Mahour Mellat/D-4084-2012","Parast, Mahour Mellat/0000-0001-6589-1076",National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [123887],This research is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) [grant number 123887] (Research Initiation Award: Understanding Risks and Disruptions in Supply Chains and their Effect on Firm and Supply Chain Performance).,,42,52,52,6,81,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

These undertakings all demand a modern, handy fiscal and taxation law system. On the other hand, after two decades of implementation of the 1994 tax sharing system, the original initiative of strengthening centralized control might not keep pace with the needs of balancing decentralization and local financing demands, in addition to the troublesome taxpayers' protection, tax judicature reform, and worsening environmental irregularities. Admittedly, China's fiscal and taxation law reform faces new challenges and incentives. Rigorous international tax frameworks and multi-jurisdictional cooperation drive China to respond as an international trade giant and a responsible game player. Such international tax policy orientations create another layer of incentives and necessity for China to fine-tune its domestic fiscal and taxation legal framework, ranging from promotion of free trade zones, global sourcing practice and supply chain management, renegotiation of outdated tax treaty articles, more active participation in consequential overseas investments, to WTO Protocol compliance review, and international tax dispute resolution. Therefore, this article argues that, no matter the extent to which feasible, plausible or pragmatic proposals are presented, a top level architecting and a serious pursuit to upgrade citizens' livelihood must be prioritized in earnest.","[Hu Tianlong] Renmin Univ China, Sch Law, Law, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hu Tianlong] Renmin Univ China, PRC Minist Educ, Natl Ctr Civil & Commercial Law, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hu Tianlong] Renmin Univ China, Int Monetary Inst, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China","Hu, TL (corresponding author), Renmin Univ China, Sch Law, Law, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Hu, TL (corresponding author), Renmin Univ China, PRC Minist Educ, Natl Ctr Civil & Commercial Law, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Hu, TL (corresponding author), Renmin Univ China, Int Monetary Inst, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",hut@umich.edu,,,"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China [14XNJ002, 14XNF007]","This article is supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, and the Research Funds of Renmin University of China (14XNJ002) and (14XNF007).

Design/methodology/approach - This study conducted a survey on 201 AEO programs in Korea. With partial least squares, the structure model is tested using the coefficient value of the determination of the dependent variable, explained by the sign and scale of the path coefficient, statistical significance, and leading variable. Moreover, this study performed bootstrap re-sampling to verify all paths and significance. Findings - It was found that AEO external pressure, training capacity, and sustainability are shown to have a significant impact on AEO performance. Furthermore, for the group with a high level of AEO application, training capacity and AEO sustainability are shown to have a greater effect on AEO performance. For the group with a low level of AEO application, internal regulation is shown to have a bigger impact on AEO performance. Originality/value - This study sets itself apart from previous ones in that it examines AEO application for trade security and facilitation with regard to customs, which would affect global supply-chain management.","[Chang-Bong, Kim; Kwon, Seung-Ha] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Trade & Logist, Seoul, South Korea; [Chun, Hong-Uk] Korea Customs Serv, Seoul, South Korea","Kwon, SH (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Dept Trade & Logist, Seoul, South Korea.",seunghkwon@gmail.com,,,,,,38,3,3,0,18,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

The decision problem facing the OEM is to determine the selling prices for both new and remanufactured versions of the same product, and the collection effort devoted to acquire the cores. Key features of the underlying problem include supply constrained from the reversed logistics and finite multi-period product life cycle, i.e. the product will be phased out after a finite number of periods in the market. This study formulates the problem using Lagrangian relaxation technique, and proposes an iterative search algorithm for solving the problem. Due to its complexity involved with high-dimensional matrix and dynamic nature, an adaptive search scheme is also developed using genetic algorithms. Numerical results reveal that the solutions generated by GAs are optimal in small-sized problems, e.g. in a two-period scenario, and are near optimal in median to large-sized problems, e.g. in a four-period scenario. Further analysis reveals that the decisions depend critically on the phases of product life cycle.","[Chen, Jen-Ming; Chang, Chia-I] Natl Cent Univ, Inst Ind Management, Taoyuan, Taiwan","Chen, JM (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Inst Ind Management, Taoyuan, Taiwan.",jmchen@mgt.ncu.edu.tw,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC101-2410-H-008-009-MY3, NSC102-2410-H-008-048-MY2]","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [grant number NSC101-2410-H-008-009-MY3, NSC102-2410-H-008-048-MY2].",,50,0,0,1,21,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2168-1015,2168-1023,,J IND PROD ENG,J.

The case of early adopters of C-TPAT supply chain security certification,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Prospect theory; Administrative innovation; Standard adoption,PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; LOGISTICS; DECISIONS; STRATEGY,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to focus on adoption of certified management standards, specifically public standards. Such standards play an increasingly important role in today's business environment. However, to generate adoption benefits, they must be first widely accepted - a situation where they have become viewed as the de facto norms. For this state to occur early adopters play a critical role. Past research has argued that early adopters, in exchange for assuming more risk, are rewarded with higher economic returns. Yet, these findings are based on private, not public standards. With public standards, early adopters do not receive such benefits. There is evidence that public standards are becoming more important. This situation leads to a simple but important question addressed in this study - if early adopters assume the risks of embracing a new public standard without economic benefits, then what is their motivation? To resolve this question, this study draws on agency theory and prospect theory. The authors argue that early adopters embrace such standards because of their desire to minimize risk resulting from failure to support the goal at the heart of the public standards. Design/methodology/approach - Data were obtained from the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) Partners Cost Benefit Survey and analyzed through structural equation modeling. Findings - Early adopters of public standards are not driven by economic benefits but rather by the need to minimize their exposure to the risks associated with failing to satisfy the goals associated with a public standard. In other words, they were motivated by the need to minimize costs. In the case of C-TPAT, these costs are those of failing to provide or improve network security. Research limitations/implications - This study has shed new light on the standards adoption process by clarifying the specific motivations that drive early adoption of a public standard. In addition to identifying the loss aversion motives of early adopters and economic benefit motives of later adopters, the authors have also elaborated on the notion that standards have differing levels of precedence, particularly when comparing private with public standards. Practical implications - In a world characterized by increasing demands for outcomes such as improved security and where governmental funding is falling, due to growing deficits and governments that are becoming more conservative, the authors expect the use of public standards to increase. Originality/value - Different from prior research on private standard, the paper focuses on the organizations involved in the adoption and diffusion of a public standard, with special attention being devoted to the early adopters. The paper provides a theoretical explanation for the actions of early adopters of a public standard through the theoretical lens of prospect theory.","[Ni, John Z.] Univ Rhode Isl, Coll Business Adm, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Melnyk, Steve A.] Michigan State Univ, Eli Broad Coll Business, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Ritchie, William J.] James Madison Univ, Coll Business, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA; [Flynn, Barbara F.] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Indianapolis, IN 46204 USA","Ni, JZ (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Coll Business Adm, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",john_ni@uri.edu,,,,,,47,10,11,2,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0144-3577,1758-6593,,INT J OPER PROD MAN,Int.

This is so that decision and policy makers can identify relevant alignments between disparate and conflicting priority elements in the field. Noting the complexity of inter-related challenges posed by food security, food supply chains and growing concerns over food waste, this paper also seeks to identify cross-cutting themes relative to shared energy and water security objectives also. The authors develop and adapt an existing food security framework to encapsulate the above culminating in a systems archetype that defines the intimate feed-forward relationship. Design/methodology/approach - As a viewpoint piece, there is no empirical work to report in this paper. An exploratory review of the literature has allowed for the extraction of food security concerns that need the attention of stakeholders across the enterprise to ensure robust food supply chains can be created, maintained and sustained through a better understanding and usage of information, knowledge and data. Findings - The authors present an adaptation of an existing food security framework to include dimensions of people, process and policy through the inclusion of a number of broad thematic areas including (amongst others): management best practices; sustainable business operations; consumption rights, behaviours and trading policies; lifecycle management; recovery and extraction; regulatory changes and policy reform; environmental and climate change impacts. The authors outline an overarching systems archetype based upon a combination of the Limits of Growth, Tragedy of the Commons and Attractiveness Principle archetypes. In doing so, providing decision and policy makers to identify and explore a range of food security scenarios and potential outcomes. Research limitations/implications - This paper is a position paper that provides strategic directions on the impact of people, process and policy aspects on the development of food security policies from the perspective of local and central government decision makers. Practical implications - This paper provides a holistic worldview on key aspects of the global and national food security debate that seeks to assist decision and policy makers frame their decisions and policy interventions across dimensions of people, process and policy. Social implications - Noting the impact of securing and maintaining the production, supply, consumption, health benefits and waste recovery aspects of food this paper provides a perspective on the inter-relationships that exist within the topical area and the socially mediated inter-relationships which exist and should be considered when engaging with the food security and food supply chain topical area.

Our goal is to provide insights on how to explore military supply networks and analyse the networks' resilience against different disruptions. We first propose an analysis process of the resilience for military supply networks. Then, we present two military supply growth models - key units priority (KUP) growth model and cost minimisation priority (CMP) growth model based on real military supply activities, which can be used to generate two military supply networks. We also present a new taxonomy of resilience metrics for military supply networks. Through computer simulation, we find that KUP supply network has poorer resilience against targeted disruptions but higher supply efficiency compared with other networks. While the connectivity of demand nodes in CMP supply network has better adaptability, it is of lower supply efficiency against both random and targeted disruptions. Through analysis, we can provide decision-makers with references when they choose supply patterns and deploy logistics defence forces.","[Zhou, Qingzhong; Xiong, Biao; Li, Bixin; Huang, Jin; Lu, Sixi] Logist Engn Univ, Dept Oil Applicat & Management Engn, Chongqing 401311, Peoples R China","Xiong, B (corresponding author), Logist Engn Univ, Dept Oil Applicat & Management Engn, Chongqing 401311, Peoples R China.",zhouqz1126@126.com; xiongb001@126.com; libx1212@yahoo.com; huangjin666@yahoo.com; lsx1984@126.com,,,,,,27,2,2,6,21,INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD,GENEVA,"WORLD TRADE CENTER BLDG, 29 ROUTE DE PRE-BOIS, CASE POSTALE 856, CH-1215 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND",1755-9758,1755-9766,,INT J ENG SYST MODEL,Int.

It is widely assumed that synchronization is beneficial to the logistics performance of manufacturing systems. However, it has been shown that synchronization phenomena can be detrimental to systems in which they emerge. To study if synchronization phenomena also occur in and affect manufacturing systems' performance, a formal quantification and holistic understanding of the types of synchronization phenomena emerging in manufacturing are needed. This article aims to fill this research gap by developing synchronization measures for manufacturing systems, applying these measures to real-world production feedback data and utilising them to test the assumption about synchronization's beneficial effect on logistics performance. We identify two distinct synchronization types occurring in manufacturing systems, logistics and physics synchronization, and show that they are negatively correlated. Further, we show that logistics synchronization and due date performance exhibit anti-correlation and thus question the assumption that synchronization leads to higher efficiency in manufacturing systems. This article aids production managers in designing and optimising production systems, and supports further empirical research in production planning and control and production system design.","[Chankov, Stanislav; Bendul, Julia] Jacobs Univ Bremen, Dept Math & Logist, Bremen, Germany; [Huett, Marc-Thorsten] Jacobs Univ Bremen, Dept Life Sci & Chem, Bremen, Germany","Chankov, S (corresponding author), Jacobs Univ Bremen, Dept Math & Logist, Bremen, Germany.",s.chankov@jacobs-university.de,"Chankov, Stanislav/M-3169-2019","Chankov, Stanislav/0000-0002-5054-0190",,,,64,10,10,4,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

Hurricanes, tsunamis and floods are natural disasters, whereas man-made disasters may be strikes, terrorist attacks, etc. Failure at any point in the SC network has the potential to cause the entire network to fail. SCs must therefore be properly designed to survive well in the disruption scenario. The capability of successful survival (of the firm's SC) against those adverse events/happenings is termed as resilience; and, the SC designed under resilience consideration is called a resilient SC. Effective supplier selection is considered as a key strategic consideration in SC management. It is felt that apart from considering traditional suppliers selection criterions, suppliers' resiliency strategy must be incorporated while selecting a potential supplier which can provide best support to the firm even in the disaster/disruption scenario. The purpose of this paper is to focus aspects of evaluation and selection of resilience supplier by considering general as well as resiliency strategy, simultaneously. Design/methodology/approach - In this work, subjectivity associated with ill-defined (vague) evaluation information has been tackled through logical exploration of fuzzy numbers set theory. Application of VIKOR embedded with fuzzy mathematics has been utilized here. Sensitivity analysis has been performed to reflect the effect of decision-makers' (DM) risk bearing attitude in selecting the best potential supplier in a resilient SC. A case empirical example has also been presented. Findings - The work attempts to focus on a decision-making procedural hierarchy towards effective supplier selection in a resilient SC. The work exhibits application potential of VIKOR method integrated with fuzzy set theory to select potential supplier based on general strategy as well as resiliency strategy. The final supplier selection score (obtained by considering general strategy) and that of obtained by analyzing resiliency strategy have been combined to get a final compromise solution. The decision-support framework thus reported here also considers DMs' risk bearing attitude. Practical implications - The study bears significant impact to the industry managers who are trying to adapt resiliency strategy in their SC followed by potential supplier selection in the context of resilient SC. Originality/value - Exploration of VIKOR embedded with fuzzy set theory towards suppliers' evaluation and selection by considering general and resiliency criteria both.

Supply chain sustainability is a critical and timely topic for the developing country like India that captures increasing concerns over sustainability, whether driven by current legislation, public interest or competitive opportunity. Identification of CSFs responsible for sustainable supply chain practices and evaluating their contextual relationships has the potential to affect future government policy, current production operations and identify new business models. In response to this, this paper intends to identify CSFs based on organisational theory and model them to implement sustainable supply chain practices in Indian automobile industry. Twenty-five CSFs to implement sustainable supply chain practices based on organisational theory are recognised by means of the literature review and in discussions with experts in one case study organisation. A solution methodology based on the interpretive structural modelling (ISM) technique is used to propose a structural model, which not only helps in understanding the contextual relationship among these CSFs, but also in determining their interdependence to implement sustainable supply chain practices. Further, the importance of CSFs has been determined based on their driving and dependence power using MICMAC analysis. Our overarching thesis is that the insights gained are useful for Indian automobile industry and would help practitioners, regulators and academicians to focus their efforts towards implementation of sustainable supply chain practices.","[Gopal, P.

Then the response of infrastructure in the face of flooding hazards is investigated. Framed within a multistage linear stochastic program, the proposed model seeks to find fueling station deployment that provides the transportation network with optimum random functionality when the network is stressed or under attack. A set of numerical experiments illustrates how changes to enhancement strategies at different stages of government affect the optimal investments in resilient design.","[Beheshtian, Arash; Donaghy, Kieran P.] Cornell Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, Coll Architecture Art & Planning, West Sibley Hall,942 Univ Ave, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Rouhani, Omid M.] McGill Univ, Dept Civil Engn & Appl Mech, Fac Engn, 817 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 0G4, Canada","Beheshtian, A (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, Coll Architecture Art & Planning, West Sibley Hall,942 Univ Ave, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",ab2348@cornell.edu,,,,,,29,5,5,0,8,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0361-1981,2169-4052,,TRANSPORT RES REC,Transp.

Without them, the offerings of an enormous variety of modern conveniences, including computers and mobile phones, would not be possible. The production of these everyday items depends on a secure, sustainable, and reliable supply of critical raw materials. In addition, product development also requires new hybrid materials when targeting lightweight structures, etc. However, the mandatory recyclability of new products or materials is not obligatory or even prevailing practice in present manufacturing business. Therefore, the main research question in this article is: how to solve the challenge of recycling in industrial system? In this article, a comprehensive approach to recycling based on the findings of research projects is presented. Simplified, this involves moving the challenge from the end of the product's life cycle to the beginning, to the design or even to material development phases. Life cycle and system thinking and material know-how in the design phase are found to be essential elements of a new approach to recycling. This approach stems from the material development and market economy perspectives. Furthermore, the vulnerability of the industrial system to create uncertainty to recycling is also demonstrated.","[Pajunen, N.; Heiskanen, K.] Aalto Univ, Sch Chem Technol, Res Grp Mech Proc & Recycling, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Espoo, Finland; [Rintala, L.; Aromaa, J.] Aalto Univ, Sch Chem Technol, Res Grp Corros & Mat Chem, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Espoo, Finland","Pajunen, N (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Sch Chem Technol, Res Grp Mech Proc & Recycling, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Espoo, Finland.",nani.pajunen@aalto.fi,"Heiskanen, Kari/G-2240-2013","Rintala, Lotta/0000-0003-3260-1997",,,,57,1,1,2,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1939-7038,1939-7046,,INT J SUSTAIN ENERGY,Int.

It argues that most of the subfactors for complexity and dynamism identified for repetitive manufacturing are relevant for the high uncertainty capital goods manufacturing ETO with some exceptions such as short product life cycle and technological turbulence. A framework of configuration (on implementation of lean practices), and moderation (on the lean-operations performance relation) forms of influence from dynamism and complexity is proposed. Further arguments to be verified in future large-scale research include: (1) dynamism bears challenges, and complexity provides opportunities to foster implementation of relevant lean practices in ETO, (2) both complexity and dynamism positively mediate better operations performance and enriched value from implemented lean practices.","[Birkie, Seyoum Eshetu; Trucco, Paolo] Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Birkie, Seyoum Eshetu] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Management, Stockholm, Sweden","Birkie, SE (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy.; Birkie, SE (corresponding author), KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Management, Stockholm, Sweden.",seyoumeshetu.birkie@polimi.it,"Birkie, Seyoum Eshetu/G-7213-2014","Birkie, Seyoum Eshetu/0000-0002-4123-0721","European Commission, Erasmus Mundus Action 1European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre","This work was supported by European Commission, Erasmus Mundus Action 1.",,49,34,34,1,37,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-7287,1366-5871,,PROD PLAN CONTROL,Prod.

Calls for conceptual and practical approaches on how to address climate change have been taken up in the literature. The resilience concept as a comprehensive theory-driven approach to address climate change has only recently increased in importance. Limited research has been undertaken concerning tourism and resilience from a network governance point of view. We analyze tourism supply chain networks with regard to resilience to climate change at the municipal governance scale of three Alpine villages. We compare these with a planned destination management organization (DMO) as a governance entity of the same three municipalities on the regional scale. Network measures are analyzed via a quantitative social network analysis (SNA) focusing on resilience from a tourism governance point of view. Results indicate higher resilience of the regional DMO because of a more flexible and diverse governance structure, more centralized steering of fast collective action, and improved innovative capacity, because of higher modularity and better core- periphery integration. Interpretations of quantitative results have been qualitatively validated by interviews and a workshop. We conclude that adaptation of tourism-dependent municipalities to gradual climate change should be dealt with at a regional governance scale and adaptation to sudden changes at a municipal scale. Overall, DMO building at a regional scale may enhance the resilience of tourism destinations, if the municipalities are well integrated.","[Luthe, Tobias] Univ Appl Sci Chur, Inst Tourism & Leisure, Chur, Switzerland; [Luthe, Tobias] Univ Freiburg, Ctr Key Qualificat, Freiburg, Germany; [Wyss, Romano] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Human Environm Relat Urban Syst, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Wyss, Romano] Univ Munich, Dept Geog, Marchioninistr 15, D-81377 Munich, Germany","Luthe, T (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci Chur, Inst Tourism & Leisure, Chur, Switzerland.; Luthe, T (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Ctr Key Qualificat, Freiburg, Germany.",,,"Luthe, Tobias/0000-0002-4748-3885",Swiss Network of International Studies (SNIS); Interreg Alpine Space program,"We acknowledge funding from the Swiss Network of International Studies (SNIS) and from the Interreg Alpine Space program.

The drinking water supply comes exclusively from groundwater resources, circulating in several overlapping aquifer systems. Basin-scale water resource management, as required by the European Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC), is an extremely complex task. In view of this backdrop, CAP is currently developing a project called Infrastructural Aqueduct Plan that relies on a Decision Support System approach. The paper describes the preliminary steps concerning the design of a prototype Decision Support System aiming at the management of groundwater resources on a basin scale (Ticino and Adda rivers area). CAP Group Decision Support System is intended to be a package allowing for water resource assessment, identification of boundary conditions, climatic driving forces and demographic pressures, simulation and investigation of future forecasts and comparison of alternative policy measures. The project has been designed in steps including Geodatabase building, geographic information system (GIS) analysis (including multilayer analysis) and numerical modelling. The data collected in the geodatabase were analyzed to design GIS quantitative and qualitative thematic maps in order to perform the multilayer analysis of current and future state and impacts, for providing the decision maker with a comprehensive picture of the water system. The multilayer analysis relies on specific indicators based on some quantitative and qualitative data: hydrogeological, chemical, isotopic, soil use and hazards, climatic and demographic. Each parameter belonging to these macro areas were classified by 7-criticality classes scale and weights were assigned to each of them. For each macro area a synthetic index was calculated by multiplying class values with weights. These synthetic indexes were managed with a multilayer approach and compared with other models and tools (e.g. geological model, numerical groundwater model, distribution network model) in order to obtain criticality indexes. The assessment of these criticality indexes allow to evaluate alternative and strategic solutions to achieve a more efficient and sustainable water system management using a best choice approach. Currently the project team is working on multilayer analysis. The next task will be the implementation of groundwater numerical model.","[Gorla, Maurizio; Simonetti, Roberto; Righetti, Chiara] CAP Holding SpA, Via Mulino 2,Edificio U10, I-20090 Assago, MI, Italy","Gorla, M (corresponding author), CAP Holding SpA, Via Mulino 2,Edificio U10, I-20090 Assago, MI, Italy.",maurizio.gorla@capholding.gruppocap.it,,,,,,15,1,1,0,0,PAGEPRESS PUBL,PAVIA,"MEDITGROUP, VIA G BELLI, 4, PAVIA, 27100, ITALY",1828-454X,,,ACQUE SOTTER,Acque Sotter.,,2016,5,3,3,,,,33,47,,10.7343/as-2016-213,,,15,Water Resources,Water Resources,VG2BX,WOS:000445671300004,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

Organizations are nowadays investing in various green supplier development programs to enhance their supplier performances. The decision to select the right program for green supplier development is often a challenging decision due to lack of prior experience, limited quantitative information, specific context of the organization, and varying supplier backgrounds. This paper addresses the problem of evaluating green supplier development programs and proposes a fuzzy NGT (Nominal Group Technique)-VIKOR (VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje) based solution approach. NGT is used to identify criteria for evaluating green supplier development programs. Fuzzy theory is used to address qualitative (linguistic) ratings for the alternatives and the selected criteria used under lack of quantitative information. VIKOR is used to generate green supplier development program rankings and recommend the best program(s) for implementation. Sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the influence of modeling parameters on ranking results of alternatives. A numerical application is provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Through increasing supply chain integration, companies have attempted to manage this increased level of complexity. Supply chain integration has been identified as a key practice to manage supply chains and achieve superior performance. The intent of this paper is to explore the role of risk and risk management practices in the success of supply chain integration in terms of their impact on cost and innovation performance. By applying the relational view and through cross-country survey and secondary country data we explore differences in supply chain integration efficacy based on the risk of conducting business (measured in terms of the strength of a country's rule of law) and the mitigating effect of supply chain risk management practices. One of the main conclusions suggests that supplier integration is also effective in weak rule of law (i.e., high risk) environments. Furthermore, companies can complement and strengthen the performance impact of their supplier integration practices through supply chain risk management practices in risky environments.

This approach involves understanding both local resource availability and the demand-side implications of supplying global/regional markets as part of a more holistic SC design activity that incorporates local environmental factors. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed framework was derived from literature analysis, bridging relevant literature domains - natural capital theory, industrial ecology and SC configuration in order to develop design rules for future resource-constrained industrial systems. In order to test the proposed framework, an exploratory case study, based on secondary data, was conducted. Findings - Research findings suggest that this approach might better identify relationships and vulnerabilities between natural resource availability and the viability of regional/global SCs. The research suggests that natural resource availability depends upon three elements - local resource consumption, global resource demand and external environmental factors. Research limitations/implications - The framework has two main limitations. The current work is focussed on a single industry case study used to exemplify the approach. Second, the framework does not consider other possible industries, which might enter or leave the specific location during the company's operation. Furthermore, no assessment was made of the migration of populations within the area. Practical implications - For practitioners, such as those in the agri-food sector, the resource availability assessment framework informs SC configuration design. For policymakers, the research aims to provide policy guidelines, which can help to improve water-saving strategies for a particular region. At a broader societal level, the research raises awareness of resource scarcity amongst industrial players and the wider public. Originality/value - A resource availability assessment framework has been proposed, suggesting that the dynamics of both global and local resource demand, in conjunction with changing local environmental factors, can over time significantly deteriorate a firm's natural resource impact on the local environment. Thus, the framework seeks to deliver mechanisms to evaluate potential vulnerabilities and solutions available to firms using a more proactive SC design method and to apply reconfiguration processes that account for natural resources, based primarily on network and resource attributes.","[Yatskovskaya, Ekaterina; Srai, Jagjit Singh; Kumar, Mukesh] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Inst Mfg, Ctr Int Mfg, Cambridge, England","Yatskovskaya, E (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Inst Mfg, Ctr Int Mfg, Cambridge, England.",ey232@cam.ac.uk,"Kumar, Mukesh/A-9178-2012","Kumar, Mukesh/0000-0002-1961-5078; Yatskovskaya, Ekaterina/0000-0002-9497-2809",EPSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/K02888X/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/K02888X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,The authors would like to acknowledge the financial assistance provided by EPSRC (Grant EP/K02888X/1 - Engineering Driven Sustainable Supply Networks).,,119,2,2,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0972-7981,2049-3207,,J ADV MANAG RES,J.

Since the humanitarian logistics literature focuses primarily on emergencies and sees longer term and regular operations as being conducted in relatively stable and predictable environments, agile practices are usually not associated with humanitarian protracted operations. Therefore, this paper explores the logistics and supply chain environment in such operations in order to identify their basic features and determine if agility is an important requirement. Design/methodology/approach - Using a case study of the United Nations World Food Programme, the authors collected and analysed qualitative and quantitative data on the characteristics of protracted operations, the risks and uncertainties most frequently encountered, their impact, and the ways that field logisticians manage contingencies. Findings - The research demonstrates that unpredictability and disruptions exist in protracted operations. Therefore, short-term operational adjustments and agile practices are needed in order to support the continuity of humanitarian deliveries. Research limitations/implications - Future research should focus on a wider range of humanitarian organisations and move from a descriptive to a prescriptive approach in order to inform practice. Notwithstanding these limitations, the study highlights the need for academics to broaden the scope of their research beyond emergencies and to address the specific needs of humanitarian organisations involved in longer term operations.

More specifically, they should take into account the endogenous features (e.g., available means of transportation, and the variety of products) and exogenous criteria (e.g., the environmental uncertainty, and transportation system conditions). In this paper, a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for dynamic design of a supply chain network is proposed. In this model, multiple products and multiple transportation modes, the time value of money, traffic congestion, and both supply-side and demand-side uncertainties are considered. Due to the complexity of such models, conventional solution methods are not applicable; therefore, two hybrid Electromagnetism-Like Algorithms (EMA) are designed and discussed for tackling the problem. The numerical results show the applicability of the proposed model and the capabilities of the solution approaches to the MINLP problem.","[Jouzdani, Javid; Fathian, Mohammad] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Ind Engn, Tehran 1684613114, Iran","Jouzdani, J (corresponding author), Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Ind Engn, Tehran 1684613114, Iran.",javidjouzdani@iust.ac.ir,"Jouzdani, Javid/C-3911-2012; fathian, mohammad/S-8975-2018","Jouzdani, Javid/0000-0001-5154-0275; fathian, mohammad/0000-0002-6909-6974",,,,90,4,4,0,9,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1024-123X,1563-5147,,MATH PROBL ENG,Math.

While urban system initiatives have been implemented in practice, theoretical gaps remain at the operational design level. A theoretical framework is developed, based on design criteria identified from a critical synthesis of supply chain and operations management literature, and 'operationalised' using an in-depth case study demonstrating implementation of a Consumer Choice Portal-Package Consolidation Centre solution, within a densely populated urban geography. Findings suggest that there is a need to re-define the role of institutional actors beyond that of the traditional governance task, to one of being able to facilitate performance outcomes. Similarly, industrial efficiency dimensions need to be reorientated to include consumer participation, social considerations and multi-stakeholder service outcomes. Finally, implications for operations theory and practising managers in city logistics are highlighted, with suggested directions for future research.","[Harrington, Tomas Seosamh; Srai, Jagjit Singh; Kumar, Mukesh; Wohlrab, Josef] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Sch Technol, Inst Mfg IfM,Ctr Int Mfg, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England","Harrington, TS (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Sch Technol, Inst Mfg IfM,Ctr Int Mfg, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England.",tsh32@cam.ac.uk,"Kumar, Mukesh/A-9178-2012","Kumar, Mukesh/0000-0002-1961-5078","UK Technology Strategy Board; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [TS/I000313/1, TS/I000275/1] Funding Source: researchfish",The authors would like to acknowledge support from the UK Technology Strategy Board and the various stakeholders involved in this 'Informed Logistics' project.,,115,19,20,9,81,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-7287,1366-5871,,PROD PLAN CONTROL,Prod.

It is motivated by the increasing attention that the design of adaptive supply chains has been receiving in recent years, as it is considered one of the most important critical factors in gaining sustainable competitive advantage in the current hypercompetitive environment. Focusing on two learning processes (i.e., by imitation and by interacting), diverse types of adaptive supply chains recognizable within industrial districts are compared by means of an agent-based simulation on the basis of their adaptive performance in environments characterized by different level of complexity and turbulence. The results confirm that the supply chain type influences the relationship between learning and adaptation and that both the product complexity and the turbulence of the environment moderate this effect. Finally, the best adaptive supply chain in each type of context is identified. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Existing approaches are based on the trade-off between increased resources and higher fault-tolerance. The Fault Tolerance by Teaming (FTT) principle of Collaborative Control Theory has been applied in sensor networks effectively and appears as a promising original approach not based on the aforementioned trade-off and capable of producing networks with higher resilience. Inspired by the FTT principle, a Resilience by Teaming Framework (RBT) for supply networks is developed to address the design and operation of resilient supply networks. RBT is tested and validated through the application of its protocols to case studies in production and distribution networks. Evidence from case studies' results suggests that through FTT-based protocols and RBT it is possible to achieve higher fault tolerance with fewer resources than under traditional approaches.

Analyzing pallet management systems according to a logistics point of view is quite a new research trend. Open or closed loop networks are now applied worldwide for pallet logistics: the latter is more complex to design and manage due to the presence of a reverse logistics process; several inbound and outbound processes have to be assessed. On the other hand, closed loop systems are the most effective, both from an environmental and an economic point of views. The aim of the paper is to outline critical factors (such as the pallet logistics network, the interchange system) in designing closed loop pallet management systems; a simulation-based tool has been developed in order to support logistic managers in designing effective organizational scenarios for these systems. Cost and time based KPIs will be estimated by the simulation model. A case study about a LSP firm has been also analyzed in order to validate the proposed model. A sensitivity analysis has been carried out aiming to evaluate impacts on supply chain performance due to context parameters. The proposed study could support both practitioners and academics in better understanding the key management aspects involved in closed loop pallet management, thus allowing a most effective design of this critical reverse logistics system.

This is a multi-attribute problem where a number of variables need to be taken into account across the different echelons of the supply chain. A case company X from the apparel industry is used for the purposes of the study. The supply chain carbon assessment study requires defining the system boundaries, process mapping of the activities involved, identifying key data requirements, collecting and sampling primary and secondary data and calculating emissions based on fuel or distance factors. The research culminates in creating a scenario-planning tool with cost, effective lead time and carbon emissions as model attributes. As part of the research, literature is reviewed on best practices and methodologies and interviews conducted with functional heads, 3PL managers and experts from the apparel industry. In the end, the created tool enables companies to gauge their emissions, optimize them within their respective supply chains and identify key indicators for carbon reduction in inbound networks.

This region has been identified as a climate change hot spot, and as a region where water demand is continuously increasing due to population growth and the expansion of irrigated areas. The Herault River catchment (2500 km(2), France) is a typical example and a negative trend in discharge has been observed since the 1960s. In this context, local stakeholders need to evaluate possible future changes in water allocation capacity in the catchment, using climate change, dam management and water use scenarios. A modelling framework that was already calibrated and validated on this catchment over the last 50 years was used to assess whether water resources could meet water demands at the 2030 horizon for the domestic, agricultural and environmental sectors. Water supply sustainability was evaluated at the sub-basin scale according to priority allocations using a water supply capacity index, frequency of unsatisfactory years as well as the reliability, resilience and sustainability metrics. Water use projections were based on the evolution of population, per-unit water demand, irrigated areas, water supply network efficiency, as well as on the evaluation of a biological flow. Climate projections were based on an increase in temperature up to 2 degrees C and a decrease in daily precipitation by 20%. Adaptation strategies considered reducing per-unit water demand for the domestic sector and the importation of water volume for the agricultural sector. The dissociated effects of water use and climatic constraints on water supply sustainability were evaluated. Results showed that the downstream portions would be the more impacted as they are the most exploited ones. In the domestic sector, sustainability indicators would be more degraded by climate change scenarios than water use constraints. In the agricultural sector the negative impact of water use scenarios would be stronger. The environmental sector would be hardly satisfied especially in summer with low resilience levels. The adaptation strategies considered in this study would not be sufficient to cope with both anthropogenic and climate changes. Other strategies were discussed based on known examples in the Mediterranean context. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Economic globalization and the resultant complexity of the supply chain network plus the uncertainty of the environment makes risk and vulnerability a major challenge to related firms. This paper aims to establish a conceptual model for mitigating supply chain risk by introducing two variables named supply chain integration and organizational risk propensity. Based on extensive literature review, some major propositions are proposed including the following four aspects: supply chain risk is negatively related to supply chain integration; supply chain integration is positively related to company performance; organizational risk propensity moderates the relationship between supply chain risk and supply chain integration; the integrative model is moderated-mediation. The integrative model is theoretically valuable in further exploring the internal path and mechanism of the impact of supply chain risk on a firm's performance. The model is also practically useful in providing suggestions and references for supply chain risk management and supply chain integration.

In response, palm oil production is rapidly expanding which promotes economic growth in producing countries but also leads to serious environmental and social problems such as destruction of tropical forests, climate change and threats to small-holder livelihoods. For these reasons, palm oil production and use have become highly controversial. However, the global character of palm oil production and consumption, the number of different actors involved and its multiple uses makes promotion its sustainability highly complex. Individual nation-states can no longer control and regulate a global flow like palm oil and alternative governing networks appear involving private companies and NGOs. Acknowledging the roles of such governance networks with different forms of power means that relying only on economic and political power to explain current dynamics in the palm oil sector is inadequate. In global networks like palm oil supply, encompassing transnational material flows and multiple actors, the relevance of each actor relates to his position in the network. Power in global palm oil supply is therefore not only related to their position in the (vertical) supply chains, but also to their role in the horizontal networks. New forms of power in networks arise from steering the networks (programming) and from connecting different networks (switching). In the multiple networks that compose global palm oil provision today, different programmers and switchers play critical roles. This is briefly illustrated in this paper on the basis of different cases of active steering in global palm oil provision. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To be more responsive, humanitarians organize stocks of relief items. It is an issue to know the quantity of items to be stored and where they should be positioned. Many authors have tried to address this issue both in industrial and humanitarian environments. However, humanitarian supply chains today do not perform correctly, particularly as regards resilience and efficiency. This is mainly due to the fact that when a disaster occurs, some hazards can strongly impact the network by destroying some resources or collapsing infrastructure. The expected performance of the relief response is consequently strongly decreased. The problem statement of our research work consists in proposing a decision-making support model in artificial intelligence dedicated to the humanitarian world and capable of designing a coherent network that is still able to adequately manage the response to a disaster despite failures or inadequacies of infrastructure and potential resources. This contribution is defined through a Stochastic Multi-Scenarios Program as a core and a set of extensions.

A two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear fractional programming (SMILFP) model is developed to optimize the levelized cost of energy generated from shale gas. In this model, both design and planning decisions are considered with respect to shale well drilling, shale gas production, processing, multiple end-uses, and transportation. To reduce the model size and number of scenarios, we apply a sample average approximation method to generate scenarios based on the real-world EUR data. In addition, a novel solution algorithm integrating the parametric approach and the L-shaped method is proposed for solving the resulting SMILFP problem within a reasonable computational time. The proposed model and algorithm are illustrated through a case study based on the Marcellus shale play, and a deterministic model is considered for comparison.

This paper presents a methodology for supplier selection in a global sourcing environment by considering multiple cost and risk factors. Failure modes and effects analysis technique from reliability engineering field and Bayesian belief networks are used to quantify the risk posed by each factor. The probability and the cost of each risk are then incorporated into a decision tree model to compute the total expected costs for each supply option. The supplier selection decision is made based on the total purchasing costs including both deterministic costs (such as product and transportation costs) and the risk-associated costs. The proposed approach is demonstrated using an example of a US-based Chemical distributor. This framework provides a visual tool for supply chain managers to see how cost and risks are distributed across the different alternatives. Lastly, managers can calculate expected value of perfect information to avoid a certain risk.","[Nepal, Bimal] Texas A&M Univ, Ind Distribut Program, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Yadav, Om Prakash] N Dakota State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, Fargo, ND 58105 USA","Nepal, B (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Ind Distribut Program, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",Nepal@tamu.edu,,"Nepal, Bimal/0000-0001-9288-8964",,,,50,27,27,3,67,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

We find that the presence of cross-firm professional ties between directors and senior executives along the supply chain significantly reduces the probability of relationship termination around customers' industry negative shocks and during financial crises. The results are robust using professional-tie strength as an alternative measure. Exploring contingency effects, we find that, for suppliers who lack R&D, face high competition, are smaller in size, or are less important to customers in terms of sales, such professional ties are more helpful in sustaining such relationships. Furthermore, we find that professional ties also significantly reduce firm risk during periods of market turbulence. Taken together, our results suggest that professional ties along the supply chain can facilitate information flow and build mutual trust, which can lead to healthy long-term relationships and can help firms survive economic and industry downturns.

To increase RL adoption, robust and flexible strategies are required to overcome its barriers. This study focuses on identification and ranking the solutions of reverse logistics adoption in electronics industry to overcome its barriers. It aids firms to ponder on high rank solutions and develop strategies to implement them on priority. This paper proposes a methodology based on fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to identify and rank the solutions of RL adoption to overcome its barriers. Fuzzy AHP is applied to get weights of the barriers as criteria by pairwise comparison and final ranking of the solutions of RL adoption is obtained through fuzzy TOPSIS. The empirical case of Indian electronics industry is shown to illustrate the use of the proposed method. This proposed method offers a more precise, efficient and effective decision support tool for stepwise implementation of the solutions due to consideration of fuzzy environment. Finally sensitivity analysis is performed to illustrate the robustness of the method. (C) 2015 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Accordingly, there still exists a gap in the quantitative modeling of sustainable SCND that consists of OAP. In this article, we cover this gap through simultaneously considering the sustainable OAP in the sustainable SCND as a strategic decision. The proposed supply chain network is composed of five echelons including suppliers classified in different classes, plants, distribution centers that dispatch products via two different ways, direct shipment, and cross-docks, to satisfy stochastic demand received from a set of retailers. The problem has been mathematically formulated as a multi-objective optimization model that aims at minimizing the total costs and environmental effect of integrating SCND and OAP, simultaneously. To tackle the addressed problem, a novel multi-objective hybrid approach called MOHEV with two strategies for its best particle selection procedure (BPSP), minimum distance, and crowding distance is proposed. MOHEV is constructed through hybridization of two multi-objective algorithms, namely the adapted multi-objective electromagnetism mechanism algorithm (AMOEMA) and adapted multi-objective variable neighborhood search (AMOVNS). According to achieved results, MOHEV achieves better solutions compared with the others, and also crowding distance method for BPSP outperforms minimum distance. Finally, a case study for an automobile industry is used to demonstrate the applicability of the approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Customer demand is rapidly changing in today's turbulent environment, and organisation must be responsive enough to meet these changes. The responsiveness of the organisation incurs cost, and a trade-off between responsiveness and efficiency is necessary to meet organisation strategy for enabling competitive advantage. Information integration across the supply chain enables the network to respond quickly to continuously changing customer demand. The potential screened suppliers are evaluated in a dynamic environment using beer game simulation for limited and system-wide information availability. The simulation is run for stable and random orders to get results for varied inventory levels and bullwhip effect (order fluctuations). Thus, the selected and evaluated suppliers enabled prioritisation of the suppliers to meet the organisation's strategic objectives. The results from the study suggested that the inventory level and bullwhip effect reduced significantly as a result of integrating the information for both stable and random orders. Thus, a robust framework is devised for long-term decision-making in enabling an organisation to meet its strategic objectives. The paper focuses on devising a structured methodology for supplier selection which is an important decision in a supply chain. After initial evaluation of potential suppliers, the decision-making involves selecting suppliers. The decision-making must fulfil the firm to be responsive to customer while also serving the purpose of cost efficiency. Thus, by properly tuning the information integration in a supply network, the methodology suitably quantifies the inventory levels and bull-whip effect for effective decision-making.","[Singh, Adarsh Kumar] Caterpillar Inc, Supply Chain Analyst, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Garg, Ashish] Natl Inst Technol, Dept Prod Engn, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India","Singh, AK (corresponding author), Caterpillar Inc, Supply Chain Analyst, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",adarsh70@gmail.com,,,,,,15,8,9,0,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-7287,1366-5871,,PROD PLAN CONTROL,Prod.

In this paper, we analyse the efficiency of investment in whey-processing with the aim of releasing the productive potential of currently unexploited whey supply chains. We introduce a decision support model for production and distribution of products derived from whey that extends a globally inclusive facility location problem. The basic tenet of the model is that equipment selection during the initial stages of facility planning is critical, as capital costs in the early stages of supply chain design go into purchases of new machines and site conditioning. The model selects the optimal combination of whey processing equipment, facility locations and transportation routes subject to budget, equipment availability and final product requirements. The results from the model inform the members of a cluster of cheese makers on the infrastructure investments that better release the productive potential of the supply chain of their valuable by-product and, at the same time, avoid environmental damage. We use the model to find the optimal configuration of a whey supply chain for an actual cluster of small cheese makers in Minas Gerais, Brazil, and demonstrate that important savings can be achieved by investing early on in adequate processing facilities.

Economic viability is a key ingredient for environmentally sustainable behavior and policies, and our decision making framework includes producers, refurbishers and recyclers. We model the lifecycle of a consumer electronics product to examine the complex interactions among different participants and their decisions. Using data from recyclers and marketing and supply chain literature, we find that i) sustainable CLSC policies require a well-calibrated return rate among types of products (new and refurbished) and consumers (innovators and imitators); ii) a sustainable return policy increases sales significantly for both types of customers; and iii) product design that improves refurbishability, and marketing efforts that create perceived differentiation between products and at the same time social awareness and acceptability for refurbished products, is critical for economic sustainability of refurbishers and recyclers.

Large commercial corporations have also shown responsibility for preserving planet and people while maintaining profit. Our present paper is motivated by the three P's-people, planet, and profit. In our paper, we have attempted to develop a responsive sustainable supply chain network which can respond to a certain degree of uncertainty due to uncontrollable forces. We have developed a model using robust optimization based on three well-known robust counterpart optimization formulations. Finally, this paper compares the results of the three formulations using different test scenarios and parameter-sensitive analysis in terms of final output, CPU time, the level of conservatism, the degree of closeness to the ideal solution, the degree of balance involved in developing a compromise solution, and satisfaction degree. Two further questions related to environmental dimensions and social dimensions have been investigated using an appreciative inquiry, a quasi-ethnographic study. In this way, we have embraced mixed research design to address our research questions. We have extended past research by incorporating uncertainty in a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model and qualitative research methods to fill the voids.

The use of analytical approaches has become more and more critical for forecasting the water supply and demand balance in the long run. In this research, Istanbul's water supply and demand data is collected for the period during 2006 and 2014. Then, using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, the time series water supply and demand forecasting model is constructed for the period between 2015 and 2018. Three important sustainability metrics such as water loss to supply ratio, water loss to demand ratio, and water loss to residential demand ratio are also presented. The findings show that residential water demand is responsible for nearly 80% of total water use and the consumption categories including commercial, industrial, agriculture, outdoor, and others have a lower share in total water demand. The results also show that there is a considerable water loss in the water distribution system which requires significant investments on the water supply networks. Furthermore, the forecasting results indicated that pipeline projects will be critical in the near future due to expected increases in the total water demand of Istanbul. The authors suggest that sustainable management of water can be achieved by reducing the residential water use through the use of water efficient technologies in households and reduction in water supply loss through investments on distribution infrastructure.","[Yalcintas, Murat] Istanbul Ticaret Univ, Business Adm, TR-34445 Istanbul, Turkey; [Bulu, Melih] Istanbul Sehir Univ, Sch Management & Adm Sci, TR-34662 Istanbul, Turkey; [Kucukvar, Murat; Samadi, Hamidreza] Istanbul Sehir Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-34662 Istanbul, Turkey","Bulu, M (corresponding author), Istanbul Sehir Univ, Sch Management & Adm Sci, TR-34662 Istanbul, Turkey.",myalcintas@ticaret.edu.tr; melihbulu@sehir.edu.tr; muratkucukvar@sehir.edu.tr; hamidrezasamadi@std.sehir.edu.tr,"bulu, melih/K-4547-2018; Yalcintas, Murat/R-9571-2019","Yalcintas, Murat/0000-0002-7993-7853; Kucukvar, Murat/0000-0002-4101-2628",Istanbul Water and Sewage Administration (ISKI)Belediyeler,"This material is based upon work supported in part by the Istanbul Water and Sewage Administration (ISKI).

Recent work has focused on developing and simulating such alternative processes from integrated biomass/natural gas and biomass/coal feedstocks to produce fuels and chemicals. These process simulations provide invaluable information on the performance and capability of the specific process alternative considered. However, the development of many alternative technologies, along with multiple feedstock and product possibilities, made the superstructure based optimization methods the natural approaches to be pursued. These process superstructures can be efficiently optimized to provide insights into topological, economic, and environmental trade-offs by simultaneously weighing the strengths and weaknesses of each alternative. Despite the development of these powerful tools, several outstanding challenges need to be systematically addressed. These challenges include the implementation of different conversion technologies and feedstock types, investigating the production of a superset of fuels and chemicals, systematically addressing price uncertainties for robust refinery designs, and synthesizing a supply network optimization to potentially displace the petroleum demand. This perspective article reviews the current work on integrated biomass/natural gas and biomass/coal refineries, highlights the major advances in these fields, and discusses future directions.","[Onel, Onur; Niziolek, Alexander M.] Princeton Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Onel, Onur; Niziolek, Alexander M.; Floudas, Christodoulos A.] 3372 Texas A&M Univ, Texas A&M Energy Inst, 302D Williams Adm Bldg, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Onel, Onur; Niziolek, Alexander M.; Floudas, Christodoulos A.] Texas A&M Univ, Artie McFerrin Dept Chem Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Floudas, CA (corresponding author), 3372 Texas A&M Univ, Texas A&M Energy Inst, 302D Williams Adm Bldg, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",floudas@tamu.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF EFRI-0937706, NSF CBET-1158849]",The authors acknowledge partial financial support from the National Science Foundation (NSF EFRI-0937706 and NSF CBET-1158849).,,47,15,15,0,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2211-3398,,,CURR OPIN CHEM ENG,Curr.

A PROPOSED METHODOLOGY USING BAYESIAN NETWORKS AND MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION ANALYSIS,TRANSPORT,,,English,Article,,,,,,dry ports; industrial location; sustainability; Delphi; Bayesian networks; multi-criteria decision analysis; geographic information systems,,"The global economic structure, with its decentralized production and the consequent increase in freight traffic all over the world, creates considerable problems and challenges for the freight transport sector. This situation has led shipping to become the most suitable and cheapest way to transport goods. Thus, ports are configured as nodes with critical importance in the logistics supply chain as a link between two transport systems, sea and land. Increase in activity at seaports is producing three undesirable effects: increasing road congestion, lack of open space in port installations and a significant environmental impact on seaports. These adverse effects can be mitigated by moving part of the activity inland. Implementation of dry ports is a possible solution and would also provide an opportunity to strengthen intermodal solutions as part of an integrated and more sustainable transport chain, acting as a link between road and railway networks. In this sense, implementation of dry ports allows the separation of the links of the transport chain, thus facilitating the shortest possible routes for the lowest capacity and most polluting means of transport. Thus, the decision of where to locate a dry port demands a thorough analysis of the whole logistics supply chain, with the objective of transferring the largest volume of goods possible from road to more energy efficient means of transport, like rail or short-sea shipping, that are less harmful to the environment. However, the decision of where to locate a dry port must also ensure the sustainability of the site. Thus, the main goal of this article is to research the variables influencing the sustainability of dry port location and how this sustainability can be evaluated. With this objective, in this paper we present a methodology for assessing the sustainability of locations by the use of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and Bayesian Networks (BNs). MCDA is used as a way to establish a scoring, whilst BNs were chosen to eliminate arbitrariness in setting the weightings using a technique that allows us to prioritize each variable according to the relationships established in the set of variables. In order to determine the relationships between all the variables involved in the decision, giving us the importance of each factor and variable, we built a K2 BN algorithm. To obtain the scores of each variable, we used a complete cartography analysed by ArcGIS. Recognising that setting the most appropriate location to place a dry port is a geographical multidisciplinary problem, with significant economic, social and environmental implications, we consider 41 variables (grouped into 17 factors) which respond to this need. As a case of study, the sustainability of all of the 10 existing dry ports in Spain has been evaluated. In this set of logistics platforms, we found that the most important variables for achieving sustainability are those related to environmental protection, so the sustainability of the locations requires a great respect for the natural environment and the urban environment in which they are framed.","[Awad-Nunez, Samir; Gonzalez-Cancelas, Nicoletta; Camarero-Orive, Alberto] Tech Univ Madrid, Dept Transportat, Madrid, Spain; [Soler-Flores, Francisco] Tech Univ Madrid, Dept Math & Comp Sci Appl Civil & Naval Engn, Madrid, Spain","Awad-Nunez, S (corresponding author), Tech Univ Madrid, Dept Transportat, Madrid, Spain.",samir.awad@caminos.upm.es,"Camarero, Alberto/ABC-1905-2020; Gonzalez-Cancelas, Nicoletta/AAG-1554-2021","Gonzalez-Cancelas, Nicoletta/0000-0001-7167-1563; CAMARERO ORIVE, ALBERTO/0000-0002-0614-8714; Awad Nunez, Samir/0000-0001-8653-5118; SOLER FLORES, FRANCISCO JOSE/0000-0002-1636-834X",,,,18,15,15,0,54,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1648-4142,1648-3480,,TRANSPORT-VILNIUS,Transport,JUL 3,2015,30,3,,,SI,,312,319,,10.3846/16484142.2015.1081618,,,8,Transportation Science & Technology,Transportation,CS6WI,WOS:000362223600010,,"Other Gold, Green Accepted",,,2021-03-04

A multi-criteria decision making procedure is carried out for the evaluation of the quality of alternative manufacturing network configurations using multiple conflicting criteria including dynamic complexity, reliability, cost, time, quality and environmental footprint. A comparison of the performance of each method based on the quality of the solutions that it provided is carried out. The statistical design of experiments robust engineering technique is used for the calibration of the adjustable parameters of the methods.

However, the field of supply chain management (SCM) has been relatively slow in studying social media and big data for research and practice. In these contexts, this research contributes to the SCM community by proposing a novel, analytical framework (Twitter Analytics) for analyzing supply chain tweets, highlighting the current use of Twitter in supply chain contexts, and further developing insights into the potential role of Twitter for supply chain practice and research. The proposed framework combines three methodologies - descriptive analytics (DA), content analytics (CA) integrating text mining and sentiment analysis, and network analytics (NA) relying on network visualization and metrics - for extracting intelligence from 22,399 #supplychain tweets. Some of the findings are: supply chain tweets are used by different groups of supply chain professionals and organizations (e.g., news services, IT companies, logistic providers, manufacturers) for information sharing, hiring professionals, and communicating with stakeholders, among others; diverse topics are being discussed, ranging from logistics and corporate social responsibility, to risk, manufacturing, SCM IT and even human rights; some tweets carry strong sentiments about companies' delivery services, sales performance, and environmental standards, and risk and disruption in supply chains. Based on these findings, this research presents insights into the use and potential role of Twitter for supply chain practices (e.g., professional networking, stakeholder engagement, demand shaping, new product/service development, supply chain risk management) and the implications for research. Finally, the limitations of the current study and suggestions for future research are presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

On the flip side, it has resulted in various forms of security vulnerabilities in the supply chain that involves designers, fabs, test facilities, and distributors until the end-product reaches customers. One of the biggest threats to semiconductor industry today is the entry of aged, reject, or cloned parts, that is, counterfeit chips, into the supply chain, leading to annual revenue losses in the order of billions of dollars. While traceability of chips between trusted parties can help monitor the supply chain at various points in the flow, existing solutions are in the form of integrating costly hardware units on chip, or utilizing easy-to-circumvent inspection-based detection techniques. In this article, we propose a technique for adaptive unique ID generation that leverages process variations, enabling chip traceability. The proposed method stimulates digital chips with an analog signal from the supply lines, which serve as primary inputs to each gate in the signal path. Using a sinusoidal signal that exercises the transistors as gain components, we create a chip-specific response that can be post-processed into a digital ID. The proposed technique enables quick and cost-effective authenticity validation that requires no on-chip hardware support. Our simulation and experimentation on actual chips show that the proposed technique is capable of generating unique IDs even in the presence of environmental noise.","[Suresh, Chandra K.

Schedules can be systematically repaired through specific modifications within buffers by using appropriate decision models that consider the distributed nature of a supply chain. To this aim, information of disruptive events at occurrence or in advance allows decision models to make better decisions. To detect and predict disruptive events along a schedule execution, a service-oriented monitoring subsystem that uses a reference model for defining monitoring models was proposed. This subsystem offers services for collecting execution data of a schedule and environment data, and assessing them to detect/anticipate disruptive events. Because of the distributed nature and the complexity of these services functionalities, this paper presents an agent-based approach for their implementation. This technology allows dealing with supply chain monitoring by structuring monitoring subsystem functionalities as a set of autonomous entities.

The participating firms were classified into focal, downstream, and upstream firms. The data set was grouped in two namely aggregate which includes all the firms and independent data which consists of each firm's classification. Partial Least Squares (PLS) method was used to identify the determinants of green practices. The aggregate data show that external environmental factors (including customer pressures, regulatory pressures, government supports, and environmental uncertainty) were the most important in adopting green practices. For the focal firms, the independent data show that relative advantage, quality of human resources and customer pressure are positively associated with the adoption of green practice and they positively influence operations systems' performance. Conversely, the downstream firms are more efficient and effective when there are organizational and governmental supports. For upstream firms, the critical factors to organizational performance are compatibility, customer and regulatory pressures. In both the downstream and upstream firms, the factor complexity which denotes the lack of understanding and learning of green practices is the key barrier to implementing green practices. Knowledge of these critical factors for green supply chain management practice would help Chinese firms to become more environmentally responsible while simultaneously achieving their operational performance goals.

Manufacturers must take responsibility for their products over the entire life cycle. In this context, there is a need for network design methods for effectively managing recovery operations and waste. The purpose of this study is to develop a mathematical programming model for managing reverse flows in end-of-life vehicles' recovery network. A reverse flow is the collection of used products from consumers and the transportation of these products for the purpose of recycling, reuse or disposal. The proposed model includes all operations in a product recovery and waste management network for used vehicles and reuse for vehicle parts such as collection, disassembly, refurbishing, processing (shredding), recycling, disposal and reuse of vehicle parts. The scope of the network model is to determine the numbers and locations of facilities in the network and the material flows between these facilities. The results show the performance of the model and its applicability for use in the planning of recovery operations in the automotive industry. The main objective of recovery and waste management is to maximize revenue and minimize pollution in end-of-life product operations. This study shows that with an accurate model, these activities may provide economic benefits and incentives in addition to protecting the environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

These coordination decisions can have far-reaching and complex implications for overall food supply chain structural emergence, which in turn impacts system outcomes and long-term sustainability. In this paper, we describe an agent-based model that explores the impacts of farmer coordination decisions on the development of food supply chain structure over time. This model focuses on one type of coordination mechanism implementation method, in which coordinated farmer groups produce a single crop type and combine their yields to achieve economies of scale. The farmer agents' decisions to coordinate with one another depend on their evaluation of the tradeoff between their autonomy and the expected economic benefits of coordination. Each coordination decision is a bilateral process in which the terms of group reward sharing are negotiated. We capture the effects of farmers' size, income, and autonomy premia, as well as volume-price relationships and group profit-sharing rules, on the rate of farmer coordination and the number and size of groups that form. Results indicate that under many conditions, coordination groups tend to consolidate over time, which suggests implications for overall supply chain structural resilience.","[Krejci, Caroline] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Beamon, Benita] Univ Washington, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Krejci, C (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, 3004 Black Engn Bldg, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",ckrejci@iastate.edu; benita@uw.edu,,,,,,14,7,7,1,29,J A S S S,GUILDFORD,"UNIV SURREY, DEPT SOCIOLOGY, GUILDFORD GU2 7XH, SURREY, ENGLAND",1460-7425,,,JASSS-J ARTIF SOC S,JASSS,MAR 31,2015,18,2,,,,,,,19,10.18564/jasss.2727,,,20,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Sciences - Other Topics,CH9RL,WOS:000354373800022,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

Likewise, there is still a limited understanding of firms' supply chain resilience (SCR) and its related antecedents in the strategic management literature. This research focuses on exploring the relationship between firm innovativeness and SCR in an attempt to facilitate bridging the gap between two important research streams and shed some light on the contingent value of firm innovativeness against disruptions and adversities. The moderating role of supply uncertainty and interdependence in the focal relationship was also hypothesised and tested. Findings suggest that firm innovativeness is positively associated with firm SCR, and supply uncertainty negatively moderates this relationship but interdependence does not. We argue that this could be due to the dual nature of interdependence in supply networks.","[Golgeci, Ismail] Univ Vaasa, Fac Business Studies, Dept Mkt, FI-65101 Vaasa, Finland; [Ponomarov, Serhiy Y.] Mil Coll South Carolina, Sch Business Adm, Citadel, Charleston, SC 29409 USA","Golgeci, I (corresponding author), Univ Vaasa, Fac Business Studies, Dept Mkt, POB 700, FI-65101 Vaasa, Finland.",igolgeci@uva.fi,,"Golgeci, Ismail/0000-0002-6853-3255",,,,53,31,31,8,84,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-7325,1465-3990,,TECHNOL ANAL STRATEG,Technol.

Hence, consumer behaviour has begun to change as they have started to assess the environmental impacts of the products and services they buy. Although various methods exist for measuring environmental (e.g. carbon) impacts, there is no international consensus about the most appropriate one. In addition, calculations can also be affected by limited data availability and uncertainty surrounding the value of key variables. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for measuring and analysing the carbon footprint in supply chains. This research contributes to the knowledge and practice of green supply chain management, at the corporate level, by providing robustness. This aids the decision-making process by identifying strategies in order to reach the efficiency that can be achieved by reducing CO2 emission over the supply network. The framework is validated using real data from a supply chain belonging to the agro-industrial sector. Finally, these results and experience is generalised in order to show the difficulties and challenges in the measuring task.","[Montoya-Torres, Jairo R.; Gutierrez-Franco, Edgar] Univ La Sabana, Escuela Int Ciencias Econ & Adm, Bogota, Colombia; [Gutierrez-Franco, Edgar] Fac Ingn, Ctr Latin Amer Logist Innovat, Bogota, Colombia; [Blanco, Edgar E.] MIT, Ctr Transportat & Logist, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Montoya-Torres, JR (corresponding author), Univ La Sabana, Escuela Int Ciencias Econ & Adm, Bogota, Colombia.",jairo.montoya@unisabana.edu.co,"Montoya-Torres, Jairo R./B-8681-2009","Montoya-Torres, Jairo R./0000-0002-6251-3667; Gutierrez Franco, Edgar/0000-0002-8128-5356","Universidad de La Sabana, Colombia; European CommunityEuropean Commission [ESR-299255]","The work presented in this paper was carried out while first and second authors were visiting scholars within the MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics, Cambridge, USA, supported by research funds from Universidad de La Sabana, Colombia.

In this paper, a comprehensive optimization model is proposed to maximise the after-tax profit of a closed-loop global supply chain for medical devices under uncertainty. The uncertainty of the decision-making environment is modelled using the budget of uncertainty concept in interval robust optimization. International financial issues due to the Economic Cooperation Organisation Trade Agreement as well as national regulations including transfer pricing limitations, exchange rates, tax rates, and import tariffs are considered. The proposed model considers various realistic assumptions pertaining to medical device supply chains such as multiple products, multiple periods, multiple echelons, and limited warehousing lifetime. In addition, reverse flows of perished and defective products are considered to address environmental concerns and customers' requirements as well as to gain economic advantages. To tackle this problem, an efficient memetic algorithm is developed that incorporates adaptive variable neighbourhood search as its local search heuristic. Computational results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model in dealing with uncertainty in an agile manufacturing context. In addition, several managerial insights are discussed based on the results.","[Hasani, Aliakbar; Zegordi, Seyed Hessameddin; Nikbakhsh, Ehsan] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran","Zegordi, SH (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran.",zegordi@modares.ac.ir,"Nikbakhsh, Ehsan/A-4006-2011","Nikbakhsh, Ehsan/0000-0002-5872-9756",,,,35,46,46,5,122,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

The study models environmental dynamism and complexity to investigate the nature of the relationships among relational resources as they interact with technological and market turbulence factors. Operational productivity improvements are the primary outcome measures in the current research. Empirical evidence, based on the survey data of a cross-section of US manufacturing firms from a wide range of industries, supports a majority of our arguments, thus providing critical theoretical and managerial insights. The findings reiterate the importance of collaborative initiatives in the supply chain for operational benefits and high levels of customer service. The results also shed light on the interrelationships among relational resource elements, filling inadequacies in previous literature: resource specificity and complementarity are found to be antecedents of collaboration.

Government regulations and customer demands are making environmental responsibility an increasingly important factor in overall supply chain operations. Within these operations, transportation has the most hazardous effects on the environment, i.e., CO2 emissions, fuel consumption, noise and toxic effects on the ecosystem. This study aims to construct vehicle routes with time windows that minimize the total fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. The green vehicle routing problem with time windows (G-VRPTW) is formulated using a mixed integer linear programming model. A memory structure adapted simulated annealing (MSA-SA) meta-heuristic algorithm is constructed due to the high complexity of the proposed problem and long solution times for practical applications. The proposed models are integrated with a fuel consumption and CO2 emissions calculation algorithm that considers the vehicle technical specifications, vehicle load, and transportation distance in a green supply chain environment. The proposed models are validated using well-known instances with different numbers of customers. The computational results indicate that the MSA-SA heuristic is capable of obtaining good G-VRPTW solutions within a reasonable amount of time by providing reductions in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.","[Kucukoglu, Ilker; Ene, Seval; Aksoy, Asli; Ozturk, Nursel] Uludag Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn, TR-16059 Bursa, Turkey","Aksoy, A (corresponding author), Uludag Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Gorukle Campus, TR-16059 Bursa, Turkey.",asliaksoy@uludag.edu.tr,"Ozturk, Nursel/AAG-9336-2021; Ene, Seval/AAG-8949-2021; Aksoy, Asli/AAG-9235-2021; Kucukoglu, Ilker/D-8543-2015","Aksoy, Asli/0000-0002-2971-2701; Kucukoglu, Ilker/0000-0002-5075-0876",,,,36,11,11,2,49,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

Many proposed solutions for the SCF problem rely on centralized computation, which presents a single point of failure and can also lead to problems with scalability. Decentralized techniques that aid supply chain emergence offer a more robust and scalable approach by allowing participants to deliberate between themselves about the structure of the optimal supply chain. Current decentralized supply chain emergence mechanisms are only able to deal with simplistic scenarios in which goods are produced and traded in single units only and without taking into account production capacities or input-output ratios other than 1: 1. In this paper, we demonstrate the performance of a graphical inference technique, max-sum loopy belief propagation (LBP), in a complex multiunit unit supply chain emergence scenario which models additional constraints such as production capacities and input-to-output ratios. We also provide results demonstrating the performance of LBP in dynamic environments, where the properties and composition of participants are altered as the algorithm is running. Our results suggest that max-sum LBP produces consistently strong solutions on a variety of network structures in a multiunit problem scenario, and that performance tends not to be affected by on-the-fly changes to the properties or composition of participants.","[Chli, Maria; Winsper, Michael] Aston Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England","Chli, M (corresponding author), Aston Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England.",m.chli@aston.ac.uk; m.winsper@derby.ac.uk,,"Chli, Maria/0000-0002-2840-4475",,,,30,6,6,0,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2168-2216,,,IEEE T SYST MAN CY-S,IEEE Trans.

This paper focuses on a case of supply disruption of the automotive microcontroller units, which were produced by Renesas Electronics and supplied to Toyota via its first tier vendors like Denso. The first purpose of this paper is to describe, from a supply chain management view point, what happened and what actions these companies took, and to understand why it took three months for Toyota to recover to its pre-earthquake production level. Since many things happened, we apply a framework of SCM hierarchy to analyze the issues from the perspective of execution, design, strategy and sustainability. The second purpose is to identify based on this case analysis what functions are missing in the supply chain coordination mechanism of Toyota Production System, where the coordination is propagating from Toyota to upstream suppliers through the close interaction between the successive layers of its multi-layered supplier network. This case analysis implies that direct control functions need to be added to alleviate the disruption risk and secure the supply of key parts and materials. The third purpose of this paper is to show by presenting a detailed case analysis that the underlying characteristics of supply chain structure and infrastructure should be linked with the resilience tactics adopted.

This involves management decisions on the design of the contract (price, uptime guarantee and overhaul interval) and the logistics network (facility locations, capacities and inventories with given service level). These two decision levels are interrelated: the number of contracts is a function of price and machine uptime, while this uptime is affected by the overhaul interval and network responsiveness. Steady-state queueing equations explicitly model the stochastic nature of the problem, e.g. the impact of resource utilization levels on lead time of the remanufacturing process. This approach results in a non-linear mixed integer model, which is solved by a differential evolution algorithm to find the maximum profit that simultaneously optimizes both problems. A real-life application reveals that price sensitivity is a critical determinant and that measures must be taken to tackle the problem of moral hazard. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, sustainability concerns push for higher efficiency in the use of resources, reducing protective redundancies and making supply networks more susceptible to disruptions. Supply network resilience is an emerging concept related to the inherent ability of a network to tolerate and overcome disruptions, a central capacity to achieve long term-sustainable operations. However, current understanding of the impact of network formation and re-configuration mechanisms on resilience is at its early stages. In this article, resilience by teaming (RBT) association decisions, inspired in the fault-tolerance by teaming principle from Collaborative Control Theory, are characterized and applied in network formation and re-configuration mechanisms. The impact of RBT on emerging supply network topology and resilience under targeted and random disruptions is measured and compared to scenarios were only traditional association rules are applied. Results show that the introduction of supply network agents using RBT association rules significantly (1) increases quality of service (QoS) with no significant cost increase in normal operation, (2) increases post-disruption QoS by 15-30% under random disruptions and 10% under targeted disruptions without cost increase vs. normal operation - when at least 20% of the agents use RBT association rules.

In the modern economic environment, where conditions of farm profitability are poor, this type of system can be effective as a tool, especially to support small and medium producers. This paper provides an overview of the benefits and limits of the short food chain through a general SWOT analysis of it in Europe. From this analysis emerges some strong benefits of the short channel, like the possibility of promoting rural development by redistributing value along the food supply chain and the sales of designation of origin, geographical indication and organic products, an important heritage of Europe. Excessive bureaucracy and inconsistent legislation are limitations that create difficulties for farmers to be competitive. The lack of robust data on the economic impact of the short food chain system in Europe and the difficulty in collecting comparable data, especially for small enterprises, emerge as a limit in the scientific literature. The short food supply chain is an important system to promote a new food culture and sensitize European citizens to the theme of local and fresher food and to favour environmental sustainability.","[Casolani, Nicola] Univ G dAnnunzio, Chieti, CH, Italy","Casolani, N (corresponding author), Univ G dAnnunzio, Chieti, CH, Italy.",nicola.casolani@unich.it,,,,,,43,1,1,2,44,EDIZIONI TRACCE,PESCARA,"VIA EUGENIA RAVASCO 54, PESCARA, 65123, ITALY",1722-4241,1974-5125,,GLOB LOCAL ECON REV,Glob.

The SC can be the means by which businesses add value to customers and therefore competitive advantage in the international market. Competitiveness no longer exists among individual members of a SC but between SCs. International literature pointed out, that strategy and competitiveness associated with specific strategic priorities. In this paper will be documented that the priorities as objectives of strategic importance comprise the key areas for the performance of the SC network. To support this, a systematic framework of strategic priorities, will be developed, which will visualize the major SC assessment areas that the SC network should turn its improvement efforts. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 200 high level managers from 71 Greek manufacturing companies covering the whole country using their own SC networks took part in the study. Data analysis were conducted to create a model that describes the strategic priorities which are important, for the competitive advantage of their SC network. Findings - The results revealed seven critical strategic priorities: internal flexibility, production quality, waste reduction, customer focus, sustainability, reduction of production cost and efficiency. This paper analytically explores the strategic practices that seem to influence SC network performance and generates a systematic framework of the critical strategic priorities of the SC network performance. Practical implications - The proposed framework has six major advantages. First the research outcome enables managers to design their SC strategy. Second, proved the great importance of the strategic priorities institutionalization. Third, makes clear to stakeholders which are the SC network performance issues to consider. Fourth, the proposed framework could serve as a suitable formula for assessing the effectiveness and readiness of SC to face the competition. Fifth, it is an effective way of prioritizing the strategic practices as it provides the most important areas on which the firm can base tasks like evaluation, benchmarking and comparison of its SC both as a network and as individual firms. Finally, the proposed framework is an effective way to evaluate the consistency of strategic objectives and actions adopted for the SC. Originality/value - Literature review revealed a very important conclusion. It has been developed a broad discussion concerning issues on strategic practices which are responsible for the competitive advantage of the SC network. However, there has not been a significant effort on integrating all the practices under the spectrum of the SC in order to distinguish the most important of these practices that can lead to competitive advantages.","[Tsironis, Loukas K.] Univ Macedonia, Dept Business Adm, Business Excellence Lab, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Matthopoulos, Panagiotis Petros] Univ Piraeus, Dept Ind Management & Technol, Athens, Greece","Tsironis, LK (corresponding author), Univ Macedonia, Dept Business Adm, Business Excellence Lab, Thessaloniki, Greece.",loukas@uom.edu.gr,,,,,,97,4,4,0,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-7154,1758-4116,,BUS PROCESS MANAG J,Bus.

Uncertainty is defined by discrete scenarios on demands where occurrence probability of each scenario is known. The optimization objectives are to minimize transit time and total cost, including opening cost, assumed for opening potential DCs and shipping cost from DCs to the customers, where considering different types of vehicles leads to a more realistic model and causes more conflict in these two objectives. A swarm intelligence-based algorithm named Non-dominated Sorting Ant Colony Optimization (NSACO) is used as the optimization tool. The proposed methodology is based on a new variant of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) customized in multi-objective optimization problem of this research. For ensuring the authenticity of the proposed method, the computational results are compared with those obtained by NSGA-II. Results show the advantages and the effectiveness of the used method in reporting the optimal Pareto front of the proposed model. Moreover, the optimal solutions of the robust optimization model are insensitive to the disturbance of parameters under different scenarios, thus the risk of decision can be effectively reduced.

Order release particularly originates from customer demand; hence, demand fluctuation directly affects capacity planning. Thus, managing capacity allocation is a difficult endeavor. This study aims to determine the best capacity allocation with limited resources to maximize the net profit. Three bottleneck stations in the semiconductor packaging and testing process are mainly investigated, namely, die bond (DB), wire bond (WB), and molding (MD) stations. Deviating from previous studies that consider the deterministic programming model, customer demand in the current study is regarded as an uncertain parameter in formulating a two-stage scenario-based stochastic programming (SP) model. The SP model seeks to respond to sharp demand fluctuations. Even if future demand is uncertain, migration decision for machines and tools will still obtain better robust results for various demand scenarios. A hybrid approach is proposed to solve the SP model. Moreover, two assessment indicators, namely, the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) and the value of the stochastic solution (VSS), are adopted to compare the solving results of the deterministic planning model and stochastic programming model. Sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the effects of different parameters on net profit.","[Chen, Yin-Yann; Fan, Hsiao-Yao] Natl Formosa Univ, Dept Ind Management, Huwei Township 632, Yunlin, Taiwan","Chen, YY (corresponding author), Natl Formosa Univ, Dept Ind Management, Huwei Township 632, Yunlin, Taiwan.",rogeryyc@gmail.com,,,,,,24,1,1,1,10,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1024-123X,1563-5147,,MATH PROBL ENG,Math.

A robust control algorithm is advocated to reduce both order and demand fluctuations for unknown demand. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the robust control approach has the advantage to reduce both inventory and order fluctuations. In the simulation experiment, it is interesting to notice that complex network structure and collaborations might contribute to the reduction of inventory and order oscillations.

The novelty of the paper lies in the manufacturer concerns about the preferences of the distributors to ensure stability of his distribution network. Hence, the manufacturer considers criteria of expected profit, variance of profit, and stability level to evaluate distribution alternatives. A decision-making methodology is presented for evaluation and selection the distribution network design alternatives. The tactical decisions in each distribution alternative are obtained from a Stackelberg game formulated as a bi-level distributed programming problem.

Recently, reshoring is an emerging trend due to various complexities involved in supply chain management. As compared with basic textile and apparel products, fast fashion products are complex in their own way. A single assortment contains several new styles, colors, and sizes with unpredictable demand and urgent deadlines. Numerous assortments run simultaneously in the supply chain. For each assortment, the garment manufacturer has to source various types of fabrics and materials from different suppliers and then manufacture the garments to ship within the deadlines. This complexity contributes to supply chain disruption. This paper develops a model to estimate supply chain disruption cost as a function of fast fashion product complexity in the global outsourcing environment. Estimation of disruption cost will help us to increase visibility and eliminate the bottlenecks in supply chain. Model conclusions are used to develop a method to manage the level of product complexity from the global supply chain perspective. Several strategies are proposed to manage the impact of product complexity on supply chain design.","[Sardar, Shaheen; Lee, Young Hae] Hanyang Univ, Dept Ind & Management Engn, Ansan 426791, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea","Lee, YH (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Dept Ind & Management Engn, Ansan 426791, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",yhlee@hanyang.ac.kr,"E G, KAVILAL/O-2779-2015","Sardar, Shaheen/0000-0003-4628-6078","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education, Science and Technology [2012R1A1B3000631]","This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (2012R1A1B3000631).",,48,10,10,2,45,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1024-123X,1563-5147,,MATH PROBL ENG,Math.

Because of uncertain existence in supply chain networks, companies encounter risk in their business. The purpose of this paper is optimal designing of supply chain networks with multi-product and multi-customer by minimization per unit cost of supply and its variance in risky environments. An interactive fuzzy goal programming is used to achieve these objectives; simultaneously. A risk diagram is used as a method to take risk issues into account by considering the probability and consequence of risk events. Credibility measure is developed to give the assurance that risk consequences are lower than a given risk level with maximum possible confidence level. Uncertainties are considered in the model by fuzzy concept as risk elements. Examples are illustrated and numerical results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Finally, as shown in results, the effects of disruption risks are mitigated in whole SCN with optimal orders allocation.","[Dolatabadi, Amir Hossein Kamali; Najafi, Esmaeil] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Taghavifard, Mohammad Taghi] Allameh Tabatabai Univ, Coll Management & Accounting, Tehran, Iran","Dolatabadi, AHK (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran.",amir.kamali2002@gmail.com,,,,,,46,1,1,0,13,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1064-1246,1875-8967,,J INTELL FUZZY SYST,J.

In contrast to this abundance of mineral wealth, water resources are generally limited, and vulnerable to environmental impacts from the mining industry. These circumstances make tailored management of water resources in the mining sector essential. To achieve this, detailed information on water use throughout a mine operation as well as an accurate water balance account is required. Blue-water footprints have the potential to contribute to this task as they allow for quantification of direct and indirect water use across the supply chain of a process, while incorporating both spatial extension and temporal duration. As defined by the Water Footprint Network's (WFN) globally acknowledged water footprint assessment methodology, a blue-water footprint is determined by calculating the net consumptive use of water by an operation. According to the WFN, this includes water which is evaporated, incorporated into a product, or lost to outflows which do not return to the same catchment area in the same period. The applicability of this tool in the mining sector has not been fully explored. Therefore, it was decided to investigate the blue-water footprint of a South African platinum mining operation. The results showed that the largest consumption of water in the production of platinum was due to evaporation from the mineral processing plants (36.8%) and the tailings storage facilities (19.4%). To improve its water-use efficiency, measures should be taken by the operation to mitigate evaporative losses. Floating covers can assist in this effort as they reflect a proportion of the incoming solar radiation and act as a physical barrier to the passage of water vapour, both vertically and horizontally.","[Ranchod, Nikita; Sheridan, Craig M.; Harding, Kevin G.] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Chem & Met Engn, Ind & Mine Water Res Unit IMWaRU, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Pint, Neville; Slatter, Kerry] Anglo Amer, Johannesburg, South Africa","Harding, KG (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Chem & Met Engn, Ind & Mine Water Res Unit IMWaRU, Johannesburg, South Africa.",kevin.harding@wits.ac.za,"Sheridan, Craig/G-9432-2011; Harding, Kevin/G-2724-2010","Sheridan, Craig/0000-0002-5913-3428; Harding, Kevin/0000-0003-2708-4323",,,,26,12,13,1,18,WATER RESEARCH COMMISSION,PRETORIA,"PO BOX 824, PRETORIA 0001, SOUTH AFRICA",0378-4738,1816-7950,,WATER SA,Water SA,,2015,41,2,,,SI,,287,293,,10.4314/wsa.v41i2.15,,,7,Water Resources,Water Resources,CK1SB,WOS:000355986500015,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

Cities as major population centers serve not only as the principal demand points but also as the locations of many of the distribution and storage facilities, transportation providers, and even manufacturers. In this paper a new model is developed for the design of sustainable supply chains with a focus on cities that captures the frequency of network link operations, which is especially relevant to cities due to frequent freight deliveries.

After reviewing the literature to identify existing approaches and methodologies to assess the environmental impacts of AFNs, the need to introduce territorial and historical contexts and critical thresholds to specifically analyse AFNs impacts on agro-biodiversity is highlighted. By building on these critical aspects, an operational approach is proposed and adopted to analyse two case studies on the role played by AFNs in conserving local agro-biodiversity in Tuscany, Italy: the cherry varieties of ciliegia di Lari and the local bovine breed of Calvana, both at risk of extinction. The scope of these two case studies is to understand if and how conservation of local agro-biodiversity is enhanced by AFNs and, if this is the case, what are the causes for AFNs having positive impacts on agro-biodiversity conservation. From results of the two case studies it is possible to highlight the suitability and usefulness of the approach proposed, not just to identify the actual or potential contribution of the two AFNs to biodiversity conservation, but also to formulate policy recommendations for local rural development.

The integration of decisions of different functions into a single optimization model is the base of this research. The aim of this paper is to study and compare the existing models of supply, production and distribution in SC and propose a model which integrates mentioned criteria in supply chain management (SCM). Furthermore, it proposes a new method for calculation of fitness function in genetic algorithm (GA) process. The successful designing of this model has led us to explore the use of heuristic methods such as GA to quantify the flow of SC, information and material flow. At first, fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) is adapted to evaluate objective function weights in SC. Then final weights of objective function are determined by the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). This research also simulated the real company SC operations, and determines the most effective strategic and operational policies for an effective SC system. The result obtained from the model shows that it is robust. This model can also be applied to other industrial environments with slight modifications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It explores the role of regulation and procurement consortia in sustainable procurement. Design/methodology/approach - The study employs a case study of the UK social housing sector and uses an online survey (n = 116) of UK Housing Associations. Factor analysis identifies three parsimonious dimensions of sustainable procurement. Attitudinal data are analysed to explore the field-level adoption of sustainable procurement and the role of consortia. Findings - The results delineate sustainable procurement activities into three factors; direction setting, supplier-centric assurance and local socially oriented supply. High yet sup-optimal levels of sustainable procurement activity are revealed. Prevailing attitudes identify positive commitments to sustainable procurement at individual, organisational and sector levels. The value of network collaboration is identified. Tenants as critical stakeholders do not prioritise sustainable procurement creating challenge for inclusivity. Regulators are seen to a have low level of sustainable procurement knowledge and procurement consortia a high perceived knowledge. Research limitations/implications - Results provide insight into the effect of sustainable procurement policy, the role of regulators and network structures and consortia, raising issues around legitimacy, coopetition, stakeholder engagement, performance measurement, and functional/sectoral maturity. Social implications - The identification of the potential exclusion of tenants in sustainability debates is particularly significant to deliver social value. Originality/value - The relative newness of the social housing sector and its quasi-public sector status provides an original contribution to the consortia and sustainable procurement literatures.","[Meehan, Joanne] Univ Liverpool, Sch Management, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Bryde, David J.] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Inst Built Environm Sustainable Technol Res, Liverpool L3 5UX, Merseyside, England","Meehan, J (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Sch Management, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England.",Joanne.Meehan@liverpool.ac.uk,,"Bryde, David/0000-0003-1779-9691; Meehan, Joanne/0000-0001-6730-9350",,,,107,23,23,4,41,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0144-3577,1758-6593,,INT J OPER PROD MAN,Int.

Such competitiveness depends on the SCN resources a manufacturing firm can allocate, the capabilities to identify and deploy these network resources effectively, and practices and applications the firm arranges for these resources. The purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework that investigates the relationships between these network constructs and their influences on firm performance. Design/methodology/approach - An extensive literature review of supply chain management was conducted to explicate why some manufacturers outperform others. A resource-based view, dynamic capability theory, and extended resource-based view were employed to develop a conceptual model that investigates relationships between the resources, capabilities, and practices of a SCN. The relationships were then examined to analyze their influences on firm performance. Several cases and practical examples were included in the study to give a better understanding of the conceptual research model. Various keywords were used in searching literature for the constructs of the research model. For example, knowledge and supply chain network were used to search the literature regarding the SCN intangible resources. Findings - This study uses a conceptual model to identify SCN resources that are dispersed in the internal territory among different network members, SCN capabilities that are developed based on these network resources and lead to the firm's competitive performance, and SCN practices used to acquire network resources and build network capabilities. Research limitations/implications - The conceptual model of SCN resources, capabilities, and practices needs further empirical validation. Practical implications - The conceptual model provides a framework for managers to identify the critical resources, capabilities, and practices of a SCN that help a firm achieve sustainable competitive performance. Originality/value - This research builds a comprehensive picture of relationships between a manufacturing firm's strategic resources, capabilities, and practices in a SCN. It also provides a theoretical foundation for future research on developing instruments for resources, practices, and capabilities of a SCN and empirically testing the relationships among the appropriate constructs.","[Jin, Yan; Edmunds, Paulette] Elizabeth City State Univ, Dept Business Adm, Elizabeth City, NC USA","Jin, Y (corresponding author), Elizabeth City State Univ, Dept Business Adm, Elizabeth City, NC USA.",YJIN@ECSU.EDU,,,,,,52,6,6,1,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1741-038X,1758-7786,,J MANUF TECHNOL MANA,J.

Six urban logistic prototypes built on the themes of future cities, community resilience and urban supply chain management (SCM) are summarized, together with details of the data collection procedure and the methodological challenges encountered. Our investigation aimed to explore the potential of logistics prototyping to develop user-driven and SME approaches to future city design and urban supply chain decision-making. Design/methodology/approach - This Boston field experiment was a case study investigation conducted between May and August 2013. Qualitative data was collected using a mixed-method approach combining together focus groups (MIT faculty), scenarios, prototyping workshops, interviews and document analysis. These story-creators could use the prototype method as a way of testing their hypotheses, theories and constrained speculations with regard to specified future city and urban supply chain scenarios. Findings - This viewpoint suggests that the prototyping method allows for unique individual perspectives on future city planning and urban supply chain design. This work also attempts to demonstrate that prototyping can create sufficiently cogent environments for future city and urban SCM theories to be both detected and analysed therein. Although this is an experimental field of the SCM theory building, more conventional theories could also be tested in the same manner. Research limitations/implications - By embedding logistics prototyping within a mixed method approach, we might be criticized as constraining its capability to map out the future - that its potential to be flexible and imaginative are held back by the equal weighting given to the more conventional component. In basing our case study within one city then this might be seen as limiting the complexity of the empirical context however, the situation within different cities is inherently complex. Case studies also attract criticism on the grounds of not being representative; in this situation, they might be criticized as imperfect indicators of what transpires in other situations. However, this technical viewpoint suggests that in spite of its limitations, prototyping facilitates an imaginative and creative approach to theory generation and concept building. Practical implications - The methodology allows everyday citizens and SME's to develop user-driven foresight and planning scenarios with city strategists' and urban logistic designers. It facilitates much broader stakeholder involvement in city and urban supply chain policymaking, than current quantitative approaches. Social implications - Logistics fiction prototyping provides a democratic approach to future city planning and urban supply chain design. It involves collectively imagining socio-technical futures and second-order sociological effects through the writing of SF narratives or building design fictions. Originality/value - Decision-making in future cities and urban SCM is often a notable challenge, balancing the varying needs and claims of multiple stakeholders, while negotiating an acceptable trade-off between their competing claims. Engagement with stakeholders and active encouragement of stakeholder participation in the supply chain aspects of future cities is increasingly a feature of twenty-first century social decision-making. This viewpoint suggests that the prototyping method allows for unique individual perspectives on future city planning and urban supply chain design. This work also attempts to demonstrate that prototyping can create sufficiently cogent environments for future city and the urban SCM theories to be both detected and analysed therein.

Design/methodology/approach Authors review papers published on agility in humanitarian aid supply chains from 2006 to 2015 in the four leading Emerald-published logistics and supply chain management journals. These are: Supply Chain Management: An International Journal (SCMIJ); International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management (LIPDLM); International Journal of Operations and Production Management (IJOPM); and Journal of Humanitarian Logistics and Supply Chain Management (JHLSCM). This paper presents an overview and update of developments that have the potential to influence current thinking and understanding about agility in humanitarian aid supply chains, and humanitarian aid supply chains in general. Findings Humanitarianism and the environment of Humanitarian organisations are evolving. Such evolution has potential impacts on theoretical discussions and understanding of agility in humanitarian aid supply chains and humanitarian aid supply chains in general. Research limitations/implications This is not a critical literature review but an overview. The paper is based on four logistics and supply chain management journals only. However, the paper is based on the work published over a decade. Practical implications Points scholars and practitioners to the impacts of Humanitarian Organisations using the relief-development continuum on supply chain design decisions including the pursuit of agility. Social implications It may be the time to consider the relief-development continuum in fresh light and its implications for agility in humanitarian aid supply chains. Originality/value This paper seems to be the first paper that highlights the influence of the relief-development continuum model on humanitarian aid supply chain design strategies.","[Oloruntoba, Richard] Univ Newcastle, Newcastle Business Sch, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Kovacs, Gyongyi] Hanken Sch Econ, Dept Mkt & Geog, Helsinki, Finland","Oloruntoba, R (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Newcastle Business Sch, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",Richard.Oloruntoba@newcastle.edu.au,"Oloruntoba, Richard/ABD-7440-2020; Kovacs, Gyongyi/B-4182-2012","Oloruntoba, Richard/0000-0002-4305-7352; Kovacs, Gyongyi/0000-0003-0569-6417",,,,91,39,39,0,56,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1359-8546,1758-6852,,SUPPLY CHAIN MANAG,Supply Chain Manag.,,2015,20,6,,,SI,,708,716,,10.1108/SCM-06-2015-0244,,,9,Business; Management,Business & Economics,DC0SA,WOS:000368926800010,,,,,2021-03-04

However, the effectiveness of Green Supply Chain (GSC) is comparatively low, as there has been a substantial amount of risk involved in managing GSC efficiently. In this contribution, therefore, we aim to identify and prioritize/rank the responses of risks in a GSC context. It would be useful for industries to focus on highly ranked responses and formulate strategies to practice them in accordance with their priority for managing the consequences of risks in GSC. The present research seeks to propose a model by using the fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and fuzzy Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods to prioritize the responses in GSC to manage its risks under the fuzzy environment. The fuzzy AHP is useful in deciding the importance weights of the related GSC risks. While, by using the fuzzy TOPSIS, the priority/ranking of the responses in a successful accomplishment of green initiatives is determined. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, the GSCM real-world case of an Indian poly-plastic manufacturing company is presented. The model proposed would offer a scientific analytic means to the managers/business professionals/practitioners for systematic implementation of the responses of risks relevant to adoption and effective implementation of green initiatives in business. A sensitivity analysis test has also been performed that monitors the robustness of the proposed network model.","[Mangla, Sachin K.; Kumar, Pradeep] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Roorkee, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Barua, Mukesh Kumar] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Management Studies, Roorkee, Uttar Pradesh, India","Mangla, SK (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Roorkee, Uttar Pradesh, India.",sachinmangl@gmail.com; kumarfme@iitr.ernet.in; baruafdm@iitr.ac.in,"Barua, Mukesh Kumar/AAF-7402-2019",,"Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), India; Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, in Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India","We wish to thank Prof. Adisa Azapagic, (Editor-in-chief, Sustainable Production and Consumption) and anonymous reviewers, for your constructive suggestions.

The quest to optimize the supply chain while meeting robustness and flexibility constraints in the face of ever changing environments necessitated the development of theoretical and computational tools for the analysis, synthesis and design of such complex engineered architectures. However, it was realized early on that optimality is a complex characteristic required to achieve proper balance between multiple, often competing, and objectives. As we begin to unravel life's intricate complexities, we realize that that living systems share similar structural and dynamic characteristics; hence much can be learned about biological complexity from engineered systems. In this article, we draw analogies between concepts in process systems engineering and conceptual models of health and disease; establish connections between these concepts and physiologic modelling; and describe how these mirror onto the physiological counterparts of engineered systems.

The increasingly frequent and high-magnitude natural disasters in Taiwan have caused significant mortality, injury, and property damage. In response, there have been requests to improve the capacity to cope with extreme climatic conditions through increased awareness and identification of vulnerability. Disruptions to transportation systems affect the resilience for sustaining daily operations. Among the various types of transportation systems, ports provide substantial employment and industrial activity, contributing to national and regional development. In addition, ports integrate the functions of supply chains such as services in logistics, information, and business, becoming the location of industrial clusters. Therefore, this study examines the risk of port failures from the perspective of vulnerability. Specifically, seven vulnerable factors derived from the extant literature and lessons learned from the previous disaster cases are evaluated using geographic information systems. The results reveal that port capacity and efficiency have a significant effect on port vulnerability in which the efficiency of gantry cranes, labor productivity, free trade zone business volume, and ground access networks play crucial roles in port failure. Moreover, the risks associated with port operation are evaluated by overlapping a hazard map of areas prone to debris flows and tsunami inundation. The risk maps can assist decision makers in understanding the vulnerability and adopting appropriate strategies to minimize disaster risks.","Chihlee Inst Technol, Dept Mkt & Logist Management, New Taipei City 22050, Taiwan","Hsieh, CH (corresponding author), Chihlee Inst Technol, Dept Mkt & Logist Management, 313,Sec 1,Wenhua Rd, New Taipei City 22050, Taiwan.",chhsieh@mail.chihlee.edu.tw,,,"National Science CouncilMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 100-2410-H-229-001]","The author would like to thank the National Science Council, for their financial support of this research under Contract No. NSC 100-2410-H-229-001.",,49,12,12,1,67,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

Considering the mixed results obtained from linking supplier integration with performance outcomes, a 'dynamic' component - or the ability to reconfigure the supply chain to adapt to changing environments - appears critical to creating a sustainable competitive advantage. This study identifies integration sensing, seizing and transforming as sub-capabilities that together form a dynamic capability, referred to herein as supplier integrative capability (SIC). That is, SIC enables buyers to sense changes in the supply environment by sharing information with suppliers, seize opportunities presented by establishing procedures to analyse this information and make long-term changes to existing processes. A global sample from the industrial sector reveals that the three capabilities exhibit complementarity and must exist simultaneously for the capability to be effective, which then enhances both process flexibility and cost efficiency and helps firms avoid the traditional trade-off of cost and flexibility. In addition, market and technological dynamics strengthen the effect of SIC on operational performance; supply base complexity attenuates this link. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Increasing regulations for carbon and waste management are forcing firms to consider their supply chains from ecological and social objectives, but in reality, however, facilities and the links connecting them are disrupted from time to time, due to poor weather, natural or manmade disasters or a combination of any other factors. Supply chain systems drop their sustainability objectives while coping with these unexpected disruptions. Hence, the new challenges for supply chain managers are to design an efficient and effective supply chain network that will be resilient enough to bounce back from any disruption and that also should have sufficient vigilance to offer same sustainability under a disruption state. This paper focuses on ecological sustainability, because an environmental focus in a supply chain system is more important and also links with other pillars of sustainability, as the products need to be produced, packed and transported in an ethical way, which should not harm social balance and the environment. Owing to importance of the considered issue, this paper attempts to introduce a network optimization model for a sustainable and resilient supply chain network by incorporating (1) sustainability via carbon emissions and embodied carbon footprints and (2) resilience by incorporating location-specific risks. The proposed goal programming (GP) model optimizes the total cost, while considering the resilience and sustainability of the supply chain network.","[Mari, Sonia Irshad; Lee, Young Hae; Memon, Muhammad Saad] Hanyang Univ, Ind & Management Engn Dept, Ansan 426791, Kyoenggi Do, South Korea","Lee, YH (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Ind & Management Engn Dept, 55 Hanyangdeahak Ro, Ansan 426791, Kyoenggi Do, South Korea.",sonia@hanyang.ac.kr; yhlee@hanyang.ac.kr; msmemon@hanyang.ac.kr,"Mari, Sonia Irshad/J-5602-2019; Memon, Muhammad Saad/M-9659-2015; Memon, Muhammad Saad/E-1144-2013","Memon, Muhammad Saad/0000-0002-9938-6497; Memon, Muhammad Saad/0000-0002-9938-6497; Mari, Sonia Irshad/0000-0001-7673-4623","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education, Science and Technology [2012R1A1B3000631]","This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (2012R1A1B3000631).",,36,45,46,6,136,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2014,6,10,,,,,6666,6686,,10.3390/su6106666,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,AS6DU,WOS:000344355700008,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

The current study aims at investigating the quality of two natural waters used as sources for drinking water supply of Iasi City: Prut River (surface water) and Timisesti (groundwater). The experimental analysis of the water quality was performed by daily sampling and analysis of four of the main quality indicators that are critical for disinfection: temperature, pH value, turbidity and oxidability for both sources. Evaluation of monthly, seasonal and yearly averages and variations also has been accomplished. Based on the results of this study conducted for a period of almost five years (January 2009 - November 2013) it was found that the main quality indicators for the two natural water sources comply with the Romanian technical norm. The comparison of the average values of the analyzed parameters for the period 2009 - 2013 reveals a better quality of the Timisesti source that would require only a simple physical treatment followed by chlorination. Prut River water source, however, requires a physical and chemical treatment followed by disinfection through chlorination before being distributed to the water supply network of Iasi City.","[Cohl, Maria; Lazar, Liliana; Balasanian, Ion] Gheorghe Asachi Tech Univ Iasi, Fac Chem Engn & Environm Protect, Dept Chem Engn, Iasi 700050, Romania; [Cohl, Maria] SC APAVITAL SA Iasi, Iasi 700495, Romania","Lazar, L (corresponding author), Gheorghe Asachi Tech Univ Iasi, Fac Chem Engn & Environm Protect, Dept Chem Engn, 73 Prof Dr Doc Dimitrie Mangeron St, Iasi 700050, Romania.",lillazar@ch.tuiasi.ro,"LAZAR, Liliana Mrs./G-9149-2014","LAZAR, Liliana Mrs./0000-0003-3337-4167",,,,21,7,7,0,4,GH ASACHI TECHNICAL UNIV IASI,IASI,"71 MANGERON BLVD, IASI, 700050, ROMANIA",1582-9596,1843-3707,,ENVIRON ENG MANAG J,Environ.

HDCF platforms differ from the existing vertical supply chain federation (VSCF) models in terms of establishing federation and dynamic pricing. There is a need to develop algorithms that can capture this complexity and easily solve distributed VM resource allocation problem in a HDCF platform. In this paper, we propose a cooperative game-theoretic solution that is mutually beneficial to the CPs. It is shown that in non-cooperative environment, the optimal aggregated benefit received by the CPs is not guaranteed. We study two utility maximizing cooperative resource allocation games in a HDCF environment. We use price-based resource allocation strategy and present both centralized and distributed algorithms to find optimal solutions to these games. Various simulations were carried out to verify the proposed algorithms. The simulation results demonstrate that the algorithms are effective, showing robust performance for resource allocation and requiring minimal computation time.","[Hassan, Mohammad Mehedi; Hossain, M.

Ever since, the relevant literature is supplied with models that aim to optimize SCN's design and/or operation. The former is a strategic process that designs network's infrastructure and concerns long term investments which undertake huge amounts of capitals. SCN managers should be able to evaluate how these decisions contribute to the overall performance of the company and not assess them with only cost oriented indicators. By employing advance financial management methods, such as sale and leaseback (SLB), fixed assets could be the medium to improve liquidity and strengthen credit solvency. This paper aims to enrich the SCN design literature by introducing a Mixed-Integer Non Linear Programming (MINLP) model that integrates SLB technique with SCN design decisions. By exploiting the properties of the MINLP model it is reformulated into an exact Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that is solved to global optimality. A real case study from a consumer goods company is utilized in order to show model's functionality and to evaluate its adaptability, robustness, and benefit. The model could assist and support SCN managers in effective decision making in the strategic level. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Contaminated food items can create a significant public health hazard with potential for acute and chronic food borne illnesses. This industry study examines the challenges companies face while managing a processed food recall situation and devise a responsive and reliable knowledge management framework for product safety and recall supply chain for the focal global manufacturing and distribution enterprise. Method: Drawing upon the knowledge management and product safety and recall literature and reliability engineering theory, this study uses a holistic single case based approach to develop a knowledge management framework with Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) decision model. This knowledge management decision framework facilitates analysis of the root causes for each potential major recall issue and assesses the reliability of the product safety and recall supply chain system and its critical components. Results: The main reasons highlighted for a recall and associated failure modes in a knowledge management framework are to devise appropriate deployment of resources, technology and procedures to recall supply chain. This study underscores specific information described by managers of a global processed food manufacturer and their perspectives about the product safety and recall process, and its complexities. Full scale implementation of product safety and recall supply chain in the proposed knowledge management framework after the current pilot study will be carried out eventually through expert systems. This operational system when fully implemented will capture the essence of decision making environments comprising goals and objectives, courses of action, resources, constraints, technology and procedures. Implications: The study recognizes the significance of communication, integration, failsafe knowledge management process design framework, leveraging technology such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) within all levels of supply chain for product traceability and the proactive steps to help companies successfully manage a recall process and also reestablish trust among the consumers. The proposed knowledge management framework can also preempt product recall by acting as an early warning system. A formal knowledge management framework will enable a company's knowledge be cumulative for product safety and recall and serve as an important integrating and coordinating role for the organization.

Viewing the desalination industry network as a supply chain provides a holistic view allowing decision makers to perform optimization of water desalination operations end to end. The methodology we propose provides the decision makers with (1) a set of investment alternatives comprising combinations of the different desalination locations, capacities, technologies, and energy sources, and (2) a decision graph showing the performance of each decision alternative in terms of quantitative and qualitative performance metrics chosen by the decision maker.

The biomass waste supply chain optimization is critical to conceive long-term viable projects and deal with the biomass heterogeneous nature and drawbacks to be used with coal, i.e. principally high moisture content and low bulk density. This paper studies biomass transportation, storage and change of properties (moisture content and hence dry matter, energy density and bulk density) through the use of different pre-treatments: (i) torrefaction, (ii) torrefaction combined with pelletization, (iii) pelletization, (iv) fast pyrolysis and (v) fast pyrolysis combined with char grinding, which produce a range of very different pre-treated biomass. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) that evaluates the net present value and the environmental impact through a life cycle assessment (LCA). The results propose location-allocation decision together with the selection/capacity of pre-treatment technologies for each scenario. The scenarios contemplate different biomass characteristics, availability and distribution for a supply chain case study located in Spain: forest and agricultural woody residues used to replace at least 10% of the total thermal inlet power provided by coal in the existing network of thermal plants.

To this end, a one-off composite sampling was performed in August 2012 in which six tap water samples were collected from private residences in the drinking water supply network of the region of Madrid. A total of 14 of the 30 endocrine disruptors analysed were found at concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 165 ng/L. The organophosphorus flame retardants were detected at the highest concentrations followed by the plasticizer bisphenol A, alkylphenols, anticorrosion agents and preservatives. Tap water in the region of Madrid is contaminated with traces (ng/L) of compounds with endocrine disrupting properties. Although the concentrations of endocrine disrupting compounds obtained are too low to be able to confirm a public health risk, and no risk has been detected upon evaluation, it should be remembered that these compounds act at very low doses and that their effects may only appear in the long term.","[Esteban, S.; Gonzalez-Alonso, S.; Valcarcel, Y.] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Environm Hlth & Ecotoxicol Res Grp ToxAmb, Madrid 28922, Spain; [Gorga, M.; Petrovic, M.; Barcelo, D.] Catalan Inst Water Res ICRA, Girona 17003, Spain; [Petrovic, M.] Inst Environm Assessment & Water Res IDAEA CSIC, Dept Environm Chem, Water & Soil Qual Res Grp, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Valcarcel, Y.] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Prevent Med Publ Hlth Immunol & Med Microbio, E-28922 Madrid, Spain","Esteban, S (corresponding author), Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Environm Hlth & Ecotoxicol Res Grp ToxAmb, Avda Atenas S-N, Madrid 28922, Spain.",saraestgn@telefonica.net; yolanda.valcarcel@urjc.es,"Esteban, Sara/AAC-1778-2021; Petrovic, Mira/L-1789-2014","Esteban, Sara/0000-0002-2065-578X; Petrovic, Mira/0000-0001-9734-1933; VLCARCEL, YOLANDA/0000-0001-5041-2204; Barcelo, Damia/0000-0002-8873-0491",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness via Carlos III Health Institute; program Proyectos de Investigacion en Salud FIS [PI11/00180],"The authors would like to thank the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness for financial support via the Carlos III Health Institute and the program Proyectos de Investigacion en Salud 2011-2012 FIS (PI11/00180).

Widely distributed source locations, varying feedstock, and specific regional conditions make it challenging to develop an optimization model that can be applied to any region to estimate the overall economics of producing these biofuels. The lack of a region specific, flexible optimization model makes it difficult for stakeholders like local policy makers, growers, and investors to make informed decisions about the economic viability and social and environmental impacts of biomass utilization. This novel contribution will illustrate an approach to develop a region specific optimization model which links various aspects of the biofuel supply chain such as feedstock source location, upstream and downstream logistics, as well as thermochemical and biochemical processing. This research shows how various individual optimization models can be combined, resulting in a complete, multivariable economic optimization model for a regional biomass network, paving a pathway for future work to develop an integrated framework for sustainability. The research demonstrated in this contribution illustrates the development of a model that can form the basis of a generalizable decision support tool that can guide investors and policy makers in making critical assessments on a local level in any particular region of interest.

However, the priority of an enterprise facing bankruptcy pressure shifts to fulfill debt obligation with limited financial resources and survive downsizing. In this paper, we define a supply chain downsizing problem (SCDP) under bankruptcy as streamlining a supply chain network in order to balance a business survival and its long term profitability. We formulate a mixed integer programming (MIP) model with specific downsizing features, which maximizes the utilization of investment resources through a combined operation of demand selection and production assets reallocation. The corresponding robust counterparts of the MIP model are further developed based on robust optimization techniques for dealing with uncertainties of demands and exchange rates. We analyze and validate the proposed downsizing MIP model with a series of systematically generated test cases while its robust counterparts are studied extensively using a large generated case. The findings demonstrate the value of our approach in discovering detailed downsizing plans in magnitude and direction and provide valuable insight into how financial debt payback could be arranged, and in a unique way show managers how the reconfigured downsized network would mitigate and lead to a sustainable and higher economic value supply chain.

This paper views supply chain decision-making from a system perspective, using multiple criteria decision-making as a framework. Systems perspectives of supply chains are discussed. Criteria and factors are reviewed for green supply chain management, supply chain risk, and supply chain efficiency. Selected papers balancing criteria in supply chain decision-making are reviewed with the purpose of demonstrating risk and environmental criteria with efficiency. The conclusions discuss how systemic features are demonstrated by these decision-making criteria.

A challenging task in today's food industry is distributing high quality perishable foods throughout the food supply chain. This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization model by integrating sustainability in decision-making, on distribution in a perishable food supply chain network (SCN). It introduces a two-echelon location-routing problem with time-windows (2E-LRPTW) for sustainable SCN design and optimizing economical and environmental objectives in a perishable food SCN. The goal of 2E-LRPTW is to determine the number and location facilities and to optimize the amount of products delivered to lower stages and routes at each level. It also aims to reduce costs caused by carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions throughout the network. The proposed method includes a novel multi-objective hybrid approach called MHPV, a hybrid of two known multi-objective algorithms: namely, multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and adapted multi-objective variable neighborhood search (AMOVNS). MHPV features two strategies for leader selection procedures (LSP), (i.e. Grids) and crowding distance is compared to common genetic algorithms based on metaheuristics (i.e. MOGA, NRGA and NSGA-II). Results indicate that the hybrid approach achieves better solutions compared to others, and that crowding distance method for LSP outperforms the former Grids method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Within supply chains, downstream distribution from producers to customers plays a significant role in the environmental performance of production supply chains. With consumer consciousness growing in the area of sustainable food supply, food distribution needs to embrace and adapt to improve its environmental performance, while still remaining economically competitive. With a particular focus on the dairy industry, a robust solution approach is presented for the design of a capacitated distribution network for a two-layer supply chain involved in the distribution of milk in Ireland. In particular the green multi-objective optimisation model minimises CO2 emissions from transportation and total costs in the distribution chain. These distribution channels are analysed to ensure the non-dominated solutions are distributed along the Pareto fronts. A multi-attribute decision-making approach, TOPSIS, has been used to rank the realistic feasible transportation routes resulting from the trade-offs between total costs and CO2 emissions. The refined realistic solution space allows the decision-makers to geographically locate the sustainable transportation routes. In addition to geographical mapping the decision maker is also presented with a number of alternative analysed scenarios which forcibly open closed distribution routes to build resiliency into the solution approach. In terms of model performance, three separate GA based optimisers have been evaluated and reported upon. In the case presented NSGA-II was found to outperform its counterparts of MOGA-II and HYBRID.

In the literature, many objectives for optimizing many types of logistics networks are described: (i) minimization objectives such as cost, inventory, transportation time, environmental impact, financial risk and (ii) maximization objectives such as profit, customer satisfaction, and flexibility and robustness. However, only a few papers have considered quantitative and qualitative factors together with imprecise methodologies. Unlike traditional cost-based optimization techniques, the approach proposed here evaluates these factors together while considering various viewpoints. Decision-makers must deal both factors together to model complex structure of real-world applications. In this paper, a two-phase possibilistic linear programming approach and a fuzzy analytical hierarchical process approach have been combined to optimize two objective functions (minimum cost and maximum qualitative factors benefit) in a four-stage (suppliers, plants, distribution centers, customers) supply chain network in the presence of vagueness. The results and findings of this method are illustrated with a numerical example, and the advantages of this methodology are discussed in the conclusion. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The total costs, CO2 emission and the traversed distances of the vehicles during transportation are optimised. The optimisation model for the strategic decision-making is formulated by effectively integrating the 0-1 mixed-integer programming with a green constraint based on Analytic Hierarchy Process. Due to the computationally NP-hard characteristic of the model, a systematic and technically robust DoE-guided solution approach is designed using a commercial solver - modeFRONTIER((R)). DoE guides the solution through the MOPSO optimiser in order to eliminate the un-realistic set of feasible and optimal solution sets. A popular multi-attribute decision-making approach, TOPSIS, evaluates the solutions found from the Pareto optimal solution space of the solver. Finally, decision-makers' preferences are analysed for monitoring the changes in the controlling parameters with respect to the changes in the decisions. A scenario analysis of the events by considering alternative possible outcomes is also conducted. It is found that the implemented methodology successfully routes the vehicles with optimal costs and low-carbon emission thus contributing to greening the environment on the demand side of a SC network.","[Validi, Sahar; Bhattacharya, Arijit; Byrne, P.

Several photovoltaic (PV) technologies exist, which cause various pathways to produce electricity from solar energy. This paper evaluates the competition between three influential solar technologies based on photovoltaic technique to find the optimal pathways for satisfying the electricity demand: (1) multicrystalline silicon; (2) copper, indium, gallium, and selenium (CIGS); and (3) multijunction. Besides the technical factors, there are other effective parameters such as cost, operability, feasibility, and capacity that should be considered when assessing the different pathways as optimal and viable long-term alternatives. To aid this decision-making process, a generic optimization-based model was developed for the long-range energy planning and design of future electricity supply system from solar energy. By applying dynamic programming techniques, the model is capable of identifying the optimal investment strategies and integrated supply system configurations from the many alternatives. The features and capabilities of the model were shown through application to Iran as a case study.","[Safarian, Sahar] Sharif Energy Res Inst, Tehran 1459777611, Iran; [Khodaparast, Pooya] Sharif Univ Technol, Dept Energy Engn, Tehran 1136511155, Iran; [Kateb, Movaffaq] Univ Tehran, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Tehran 14395515, Iran","Kateb, M (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Tehran 14395515, Iran.",safarian@energy.sharif.ir; khodaparast@energy.sharif.ir; m.kateb@ut.ac.ir,"Kateb, Movaffaq/D-9080-2018","Kateb, Movaffaq/0000-0002-2518-3988",,,,21,5,5,0,3,ASME,NEW YORK,"TWO PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",0199-6231,1528-8986,,J SOL ENERG-T ASME,J.

In addition to environmental aspects, the process of recycling involves technical, economic, social and political challenges for public management. For most of the urban solid waste, the management of the end-of-life depends on selective collection to start the recycling process. For this reason, an efficient selective collection has become a mainstream tool in the Brazilian National Solid Waste Policy. In this paper, we study effective models that might support the location planning of sorting centers in a medium-sized Brazilian city that has been discussing waste management policies over the past few years. The main goal of this work is to provide an optimal location planning design for recycling urban solid wastes that fall within the financial budget agreed between the municipal government and the National Bank for Economic and Social Development. Moreover, facility planning involves deciding on the best sites for locating sorting centers along the four-year period as well as finding ways to meet the demand for collecting recyclable materials, given that economic factors, consumer behavior and environmental awareness are inherently uncertain future outcomes. To deal with these issues, we propose a deterministic version of the classical capacity facility location problem, and both a two-stage recourse formulation and risk-averse models to reduce the variability of the second-stage costs. Numerical results suggest that it is possible to improve the current selective collection, as well as hedge against data uncertainty by using stochastic and risk-averse optimization models.

This paper taps that experience to study how the design of a supply chain is influenced by its economic environment. Consider these circumstances: the military is not a profit-seeking enterprise, they want to achieve a particular state of readiness and cost is secondary to that goal. Modern weapons systems are complex, expensive, push the envelope of technology, and the volume requisitioned is often small such that few manufacturers can afford to be in the business; and these expensive weapons systems operate in harsh operating conditions where wear and tear is substantial, consequently remanufacturing of systems and parts is a critical source of supply. Focusing on the supply chain of the US Army, this paper uses an economic model to study their responses to these conditions, how supply chain design is affected by these conflicting goals, and how those designs affect cost and efficiency.","[Wilhite, Allen; Burns, Laird; Patnayakuni, Ravi; Tseng, Fan] Univ Alabama, Coll Business Adm, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA","Wilhite, A (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Coll Business Adm, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA.",wilhitea@uah.edu,,"Wilhite, Allen/0000-0002-0787-1314",,,,27,12,12,2,51,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

Following large-scale and catastrophic disasters, local organisations integrate with other responding organisations to form hastily disaster relief supply chain networks. Such supply networks are infrequently activated in a single location, generate unparalleled uncertainty, change quickly, and are driven by the urgency of saving lives and restoring livelihoods. Unfortunately, even where sound supply chain management practices are used, supply networks have encountered diverse levels of resilience and adequate disaster relief performance has remained elusive. In this paper, several unique characteristics that disaster relief efforts exhibit are examined as compared with demand-driven, steady-state supply chains. Important differences in the flows of resource, money, and information are identified. A complex adaptive supply network (CASN) lens is used to frame what existing literature has uncovered regarding disaster relief efforts, showing how relief organisations, their interactions, and their environmental context help determine the level of resilience that supply networks experience following disasters. This CASN characterisation is leveraged to help explain why traditional supply chain management practices lead to varied results in disaster relief. Finally, complexity science theory is drawn on to set forth eight testable propositions that may help to enhance supply network resilience.","[Day, Jamison M.] Univ Denver, Daniels Coll Business, Dept Business Informat & Analyt, Denver, CO 80208 USA; [Day, Jamison M.] Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Ctr Supply Networks CaSN, Tempe, AZ USA","Day, JM (corresponding author), Univ Denver, Daniels Coll Business, Dept Business Informat & Analyt, Denver, CO 80208 USA.",jamison.day@gmail.com,"E G, KAVILAL/O-2779-2015",,,,,76,80,82,11,119,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

The article focuses on the development of a social impact assessment methodology for SMEs in selected food and drink products as part of the EU-FP7 SENSE research project. The proposed methodology employs a top-down and bottom-up approach and focuses on labour rights/working conditions along the product supply chain as the key social impact indicator, limiting key stakeholder classification to workers/employees and local communities impacted by the production process. Problems related to this emerging field are discussed, and questions for further research are expounded. The article reviews both academic and 'grey' literature on life cycle assessment (LCA) and its relationship to social LCA (S-LCA) and SMEs at the beginning of 2013 and includes case study evidence from the food sector. A pilot questionnaire survey sent to European food and drink sector SMEs and trade associations (as partners in the research project) about their knowledge, experience and engagement with social impacts is presented. Proposals are elaborated for a social impact assessment methodology that identifies the key data for SMEs to collect. The literature reveals the complexity of the S-LCA approach as it aims to unite disparate and often conflicting interests. Findings from the pilot questionnaire are discussed. Using a top-down and bottom-up approach, the proposed methodology assesses data from SMEs along the supply chain in order to gauge social improvements in the management of labour-related issues for different product sectors. Issues relating to the 'attributional' choice of a social impact indicator and key stakeholder categories are discussed. How 'scoring' is interpreted and reported and what the intended effect of its use will be are also elaborated upon. Whilst recognising the difficulty of devising a robust social impact assessment for SMEs in the food and drink sector, it is argued that the proposed methodology makes a useful contribution in this fast-emerging field.","[Smith, Julie; Barling, David] City Univ London, Ctr Food Policy, Sch Arts & Social Sci, London EC1V 0HB, England","Smith, J (corresponding author), City Univ London, Ctr Food Policy, Sch Arts & Social Sci, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England.",julie.smith.1@city.ac.uk; d.barling@city.ac.uk,,,EUEuropean Commission [288974],"This research was undertaken with support from the EU Seventh Research Framework collaborative research project under the KBBE theme, grant no: 288974, entitled 'SENSE: HarmoniSed ENvironmental Sustainability in the European food & drink chain'.",,22,21,21,0,39,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0948-3349,1614-7502,,INT J LIFE CYCLE ASS,Int.

Climate change is converging with socio-economic, demographic and technological changes to create a 'perfect storm' for the region's electricity system. Distribution networks are particularly affected, with these factors contributing to tremendous peak demand growth, about double the rate of growth in average demand in recent years. This paper reviews how Australia's electricity system is adapting to multiple drivers of peak electricity demand. We use socio-technical transitions theory to understand the temporal interconnected social and technical dimensions of adaptation in this setting. Specifically, we present an historical narrative of the emergence of centralisation in Australia and outline the peak demand problem in SEQ and review adaptation options from the international literature. We also analyse the interactions between key social groups and their adaptation responses over the past decade. Our analysis shows that adaptation has become a contested process between supply-chain actors and end-users, each with different economic objectives, adaptation needs and capacities. The resulting adaptation dynamic that is emerging shows worrying signs of maladaptation.

The model is designed to determine and optimize large-scale container flows from US trade partners to inland markets mainly located within the lower 48 states. The dynamic traffic assignment for the freight flow considers several factors such as congestion, volume/capacity (V/C) ratio, throughput and distance-based impedance and the Geographic Information Systems platform provides a visualization environment for all feasible routes. Visual analytics with the resultant geographical distribution maps indicate that maritime containers are concentrated on the West Coast whereas rail shipments are densely concentrated along rail transshipment points such as Chicago, Memphis and Dallas. The highway transportation densities are mainly visible with origins from marine ports to associated market destinations starting from hinterland and radiating further away from these primal areas to other inland intermodal terminals that serve major landlocked metropolitan cities that are not served by railway networks. Our critical finding indicates that some routes, which are not generally considered as prime routes, may actually offer the best alternatives especially when considering global supply chains.","[Lee, EunSu] Upper Great Plains Transportat Inst, Fargo, ND 58108 USA; [Oduor, Peter G.] N Dakota State Univ, Dept Geosci, Fargo, ND 58105 USA; [Farahmand, Kambiz] N Dakota State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, Fargo, ND 58105 USA; [Tolliver, Denver] Upper Great Plains Transportat Inst, Fargo, ND 58102 USA","Lee, E (corresponding author), Upper Great Plains Transportat Inst, Fargo, ND 58108 USA.",eunsu.lee@ndsu.edu; peter.oduor@ndsu.edu; kambiz.farahmand@ndsu.edu; Denver.tolliver@ndsu.edu,,,,,,36,4,4,2,47,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",1479-2931,1479-294X,,MARIT ECON LOGIST,Marit.

Reflecting the environmental sensitivity of vehicle routing problems (VRP), an extensive literature review of Green Vehicle Routing Problems (GVRP) is presented. We provide a classification of GVRP that categorizes GVRP into Green-VRP, Pollution Routing Problem, VRP in Reverse Logistics, and suggest research gaps between its state and richer models describing the complexity in real-world cases. The purpose is to review the most up-to-date state-of-the-art of GVRP, discuss how the traditional VRP variants can interact with GVRP and offer an insight into the next wave of research into GVRP.

In the context of fuzzy mathematical programming, the paper jointly considers fuzzy/flexible constraints for fuzziness, fuzzy coefficients for lack of knowledge, and fuzzy goal of decision maker(s). According to fuzzy components considered, a fuzzy optimization approach is adopted to convert the proposed fuzzy multi-objective mixed-integer linear program into an equivalent auxiliary crisp model to obtain the relevant solutions.

Under the emergency environment, the aim of the problem is to minimize the weighted time for delivering all the required supplies to the targets. For efficiently solving the problem, we develop a new hybrid biogeography-based optimization (BBO) algorithm, which uses a local ring topology of population to avoid premature convergence, includes the differential evolution (DE) mutation operator to perform effective exploration, and takes some problem-specific mechanisms for fine-tuning the search process and handling the constraints.

The decision problem is developed for the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) industry, which currently ranks among the ten largest CO2 emitting industries worldwide. In this paper, the evaluation and selection of the most suitable supplier is performed using the analytic network process (ANP), a decision-making technique that allows practitioners to solve complex decision structures. The key contributions of the present paper reside in the combination of literature and case-based derived decision criteria, aimed at enhancing judgment validity, with particular emphasis on a collaborative setting, which is highly relevant in the present context as the focal firms often lack the necessary skills for sustainability and, at the same time, are responsible for sustainability in the supply chain. The practical application of the ANP model at a major FMCG company yields robust results corroborated through a sensitivity analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Traditional enterprise information systems (EISs) have mostly been implemented upon hierarchical architectures, which are inflexible to adapt changes and uncertainties promptly. Next-generation EISs must be agile and adaptable to accommodate changes without significant time delays. It is essential for an EIS to obtain real-time data from the distributed and dynamic manufacturing environment for decision making. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems provide an excellent infrastructure for data acquisition, distribution, and processing. In this paper, some key challenges related to the integration of WSN and RFID technologies are discussed. A five-layer system architecture has been proposed to achieve synergistic performance. For the integration of WSN and RFID, one of the critical issues is the low efficiency of communication due to redundant data as redundant data increases energy consumption and causes time delay. To address it, an improved data cleaning algorithm has been proposed; its feasibility and effectiveness have been verified via simulation and a comparison with a published algorithm. To illustrate the capacity of the developed architecture and new data cleaning algorithm, their application in relief supplies storage management has been discussed.","[Wang, Li] Beijing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Xu, Li Da] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China; [Xu, Li Da] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Informat Technol & Decis Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Bi, Zhuming] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ Ft Wayne IPFW, Dept Engn, Ft Wayne, IN 46805 USA; [Xu, Yingcheng] China Natl Inst Standardizat, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China","Wang, L (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",wl2000bh@yahoo.com.cn; lxu@odu.edu; biz@ipfw.edu; yingcheng_xu@126.com,"Bi, Zhuming/AAA-3088-2019","Bi, Zhuming/0000-0002-8145-7883; LAPA, ANTONIO/0000-0002-5954-5115","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71271013, 91224007, 70971005, 70971004, 71132008]; National Social Science Foundation of China [11AZD096]; Quality Inspection Project [201010268, 200910088, 200910248]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71271013, Grant 91224007, Grant 70971005, Grant 70971004, and Grant71132008, the National Social Science Foundation of China under Grant 11AZD096, and the Quality Inspection Project under Grant 201010268 and Grant 200910088, 200910248).

The goal of this paper is to propose a system dynamics model to analyze the behaviors of disrupted disaster relief supply chain by simulating the uncertainties associated with predicting post-seismic road network and delayed information. The simulation results indicate: (1) information delay has different influences over the relief headquarter (the upstream) and the disaster-affected areas (the downstream); and (2) the change of road conditions and shipment schedules have impact on the on-time transportation rate in supply chain management. Furthermore, this paper defined and tested supplies' replenishment solutions combined with three inventory planning strategies and four forecasting methods under different lead time uncertainties. The results show that: (1) a strategy that considers information from both the post-seismic management center and the affected areas can provide a better logistic plan than an one takes information from one side; (2) the smooth-the-trend forecasting method is suitable for inventory and logistic planning when the post-seismic situations are volatile, while the quick-response forecasting method has good performance in stable environments. In addition, this paper proposes decision tree to help decision makers choose the appropriate stocking strategies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This study proposes a strategic decision-making model considering both the operational costs and social costs caused by the carbon dioxide emissions from operating such a supply chain network for sustainable supply chain management. This model was used to evaluate carbon dioxide emissions and operational costs under different scenarios in an apparel manufacturing supply chain network. The results showed that the higher the social cost rate of carbon dioxide emissions, the lower the amount of the emission of carbon dioxide. The results also suggested that a legislation that forces the enterprises to bear the social costs of carbon dioxide emissions resulting from their economic activities is an effective approach to reducing carbon dioxide emissions.

The end of the commodities boom and the global return to more normal monetary policy has exposed some weaknesses. Exchange-rate depreciation has absorbed some of the adjustment; but structural rigidities are still likely to limit the expansion of non-commodity sectors, and the increased fuel-subsidy bill for imported oil is putting pressure on the current account and the budget. The immediate focus is on demand-side consolidation to manage inflation and the currentaccount deficit.For an economy like Indonesia's to be overheating, and for monetary and fiscal authorities to be engineering a soft landing, when growth is below 6%, points to major structural problems. If Indonesia is to prevent the current rate of growth from becoming the new normal, there will need to be a substantial supply-side response to lift productivity, as well as a restructuring of the economy and the introduction of policies that make the economy more flexible in adjusting to shocks. The current economic slowdown has yet to trigger sweeping reforms; policy coordination remains problematic as Indonesia enters a big political year.Compared with its neighbours, Indonesia is largely on the outside of the regional production networks, and its manufacturing sector does not play into factory Asia. Now, faced with lower commodity prices globallyand growth in non-resource sectors is critical the lack of a large manufacturing base appears to be a weakness. Indonesia is attracting more foreign direct investment than ever and is climbing the global rankings of preferred economies in which to invest, but this is occurring without improvements to its investment environment or competitiveness. Indonesia can participate more fully in global supply chains and increase its potential for growth by upgrading its infrastructure, improving its investment environment, and using regional initiatives strategically to make strong commitments that reinforce its priorities for domestic reform.In its hosting of APEC in 2013, Indonesia championed infrastructure investment where the lack of structural reform and macroeconomic constraints are inhibiting much-needed expansion, both in Indonesia and in the region. The positive outcome, albeit only a small step forward for the Doha Round, at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Bali, in December, also builds momentum for better regional and global cooperation. The priority now is for Indonesia to commit to, and show leadership in, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the implementation of the ASEAN Economic Community. Seiring dengan beranjaknya Indonesia menuju pemilihan umum 2014, perekonomian justru menunjukkan tanda-tanda perlambatan. Berakhirnya masa keemasan komoditas dan kembalinya perekonomian global kepada pola kebijakan moneter yang normal telah menyingkap beberapa kelemahan. Depresiasi nilai tukar telah membantu menyerap sebagian kelemahan tersebut, namun kekakuan struktural masih akan membatasi ekspansi sektor-sektor non-komoditas. Selain itu, bertambahnya beban subsidi bahan bakar memberikan tekanan pada transaksi berjalan dan pada anggaran. Fokus jangka pendek adalah konsolidasi sisi permintaan untuk dapat mengelola inflasi dan deficit transaksi berjalan.Bagi ekonomi seperti Indonesia, adanya gejala overheating, dan adanya upaya otoritas moneter dan fiskal untuk menahannya pada saat pertumbuhan di bawah 6%, menunjukkan adanya masalah struktural yang mendalam. Jika Indonesia tidak ingin terperangkap dalam pertumbuhan saat ini sebagai keseimbangan baru, berbagai respon dari sisi penawaran harus dilakukan untuk menaikkan produktivitas, disertai restrukturisasi ekonomi, serta kebijakan-kebijakan yang membuat perekonomian lebih fleksibel terhadap guncangan. Perlambatan ekonomi yang terjadi sekarang belum bisa memicu reformasi yang menyeluruh; kordinasi kebijakan tetap menjadi masalah utama saat Indonesia memasuki tahun politik 2014.Dibandingkan dengan negara-negara tetangganya, Indonesia masih tertinggal dalam hal jaringan produksi regional, dan sektor industri pengolahannya belum terlibat dalam pabrik Asia. Saat ini, dengan turunnya harga komoditas global - dan pertumbuhan sektor-sektor selain sumber daya alam adalah sangat penting - kurangnya basis industri pengolahan menjadi salah satu satu kelemahan utama. Saat ini, Indonesia berhasil menarik investasi asing langsung (FDI) dalam jumlah yang terbesar dibandingkan periode-periode sebelumnya. Posisi Indonesia juga kini tengah berada di antara negara-negara favorit untuk investasi. Namun semua ini terjadi tanpa disertai perbaikan pada iklim investasi atau daya saing. Indonesia dapat berpartisipasi lebih dalam lagi dalam rantai penawaran global sekaligus menaikkan potensi pertumbuhannya dengan menambah kualitas dan jumlah infrastruktur, memperbaiki iklim investasi, serta memanfaatkan inisiatif-inisiatif regional untuk membuat komitmen yang dapat memperkuat prioritas reformasi dalam negeri.Sebagai tuan rumah APEC pada tahun 2013, Indonesia mendorong perlunya investasi infrastruktur di saat kurangnya reformasi struktural dan adanya kendala-kendala makroekonomi menjadi penghambat ekpansi yang sangat dibutuhkan, baik di Indonesia maupun di negara-negara lain. Selain itu, sekalipun konferensi Tingkat Menteri di Bali yang diselenggarakan pada Desember lalu hanyalah sebagian kecil dari langkah bagi Perundingan Doha, keberadaannya juga berhasil membangun momentum bagi kerjasama regional dan global. Saat ini, prioritas Indonesia adalah untuk menunjukkan komitmen dan kepemimpinan di ajang Kerjasama Ekonomi Komprehensif Regional (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership/ RCEP) serta mengimplementasikan Masyarakat Ekonomi ASEAN/ MEA(ASEAN Economic Community/ AEC).","[Armstrong, Shiro] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Rahardja, Sjamsu] World Bank, Washington, DC USA","Armstrong, S (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,"Resosudarmo, Budy P/K-1129-2017; Burke, Paul/G-3757-2010; Armstrong, Shiro/Q-4118-2019","Resosudarmo, Budy P/0000-0003-2273-9765; Burke, Paul/0000-0003-2715-2672; Armstrong, Shiro/0000-0001-9756-7860",,,,45,5,5,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Pallets are the most common unit-load platform used across the world and allow for efficient and seamless handling, storage, and transportation of goods. Every year, 500 million new pallets are manufactured and become part of the large pool (roughly 2 billion) of pallets that are in circulation in the United States. Wood remains the most common pallet material, accounting for more than 90 percent of the inventory and applications worldwide. As companies strive to become more sustainable, a thorough understanding of the environmental impacts of every aspect of their logistics operations becomes critical. Among the many factors affecting the life cycle of wood pallets are the pallet structural design, logistics management approach, and service environment conditions. This work is the result of a comprehensive 2-year study on the operations and practices that take place during a wood pallet life cycle. In this article, a prescribed approach for estimating the carbon footprint, or greenhouse gas emissions, that arise across all phases of a pallet life cycle, is presented. In addition, the impact of contributing materials, processes, and activities in each phase is quantified. The findings presented in this article provide a foundation to guide strategies on pallet design and returnable container network and policy design.","[Carrano, Andres L.] Auburn Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Thorn, Brian K.; Woltag, Henry] Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Rochester, NY 14623 USA","Carrano, AL (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",carrano@auburn.edu; bkteie@rit.edu; hsw7863@rit.edu,"Carrano, Andres Leonardo/D-9090-2018","Carrano, Andres Leonardo/0000-0003-0081-1973",Material Industry of America (MHIA) [11100576],"This project was funded by Material Industry of America (MHIA) Research Grant 11100576.

In addition, in the proposed model capacity of facilities is determined as decision variables which are often assumed to be as an input parameter. Then, the robust counterpart of the presented model according to the recent advances in robust optimization theory is developed to deal with the inherent uncertainty of input parameters. Computational results illustrate that the proposed robust optimization model has high degree of responsiveness in dealing with uncertainty compared with deterministic model.

The focus of the paper is on developing efficient solution methodologies of the selected NP-hard problem. Based on computational limitations, common exact and approximation solution approaches are unable to solve real-world instances of such NP-hard problems in a reasonable time. These approaches involve cumbersome computational steps in real-size cases. In order to solve the mixed integer linear programming model, we develop an artificial immune system and a sheep flock algorithm to achieve better solutions in comparison to earlier approaches. The evaluations are set up based on two phases; first, comparing performances of two proposed algorithms with two previous studies with the same data (two previously proposed genetic algorithm and ant colony optimization methods) and second, evaluating two proposed algorithms in larger instances. Computational studies reveal that the proposed algorithms present acceptable performance by achieving solutions that are more robust in a proper time.","[Kannan, Devika] Aalborg Univ, Dept Mech & Mfg Engn, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Govindan, Kannan] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Business & Econ, Odense, Denmark; [Soleimani, Hamed] Islamic Azad Univ, Fac Ind & Mech Engn, Qazvin Branch, Qazvin, Iran","Govindan, K (corresponding author), Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Business & Econ, Odense, Denmark.",gov@sam.sdu.dk,"Govindan, Kannan/M-5996-2017; , Hamed/J-9733-2019; Kannan, Devika/Q-6233-2018","Govindan, Kannan/0000-0002-6204-1196; , Hamed/0000-0002-9106-8291; Kannan, Devika/0000-0003-4365-0313",,,,51,5,5,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0233-1934,1029-4945,,OPTIMIZATION,Optimization,,2014,63,10,,,SI,,1465,1479,,10.1080/02331934.2014.898148,,,15,"Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,AN0EN,WOS:000340256400003,,,,,2021-03-04

Utilizing empirical work on the development of certification and labeling schemes designed to ensure the safe recycling of used electronics, or e-wastes, across a global supply chain, this paper extends lessons learned from these critical analyses of consumer politics to ongoing debates about e-waste, trade, and recycling. I highlight the ambiguities and democratic deficits that emerge from promoting global environmental justice politics through market-driven disposal choices. I analyze the practices of representation through which NGOs and institutions produce e-waste as an object of regulation/commodification that is amenable to consumer action and argue that there is a disconnect between the abstractions necessary to sell 'ethical' e-waste recycling and the nuances of place-specific recycling practices. Like other fair trade schemes, certifications for ethical electronics recyclers rely upon narratives, such as environmental justice, that construct the e-waste problem in ways that render it governable, or 'legible' in Scott's sense. However, given the complexity of global commodity-networks like those for used electronics, these governing narratives rely on abstractions that oversimplify and rework the fetish of what e-waste is, where it goes, and how it should be managed. In unearthing both what labels do as well as the silences and ambiguities embedded within them, the limits and opportunities of consumer-driven waste politics come more clearly into view.","Univ Georgia, Dept Geog, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Pickren, G (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Geog, 210 Field St, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",Pickren1@uga.edu,,,,,,79,24,24,1,62,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0308-518X,1472-3409,,ENVIRON PLANN A,Environ.

Quality and security of supply for single-use bioreactors (SUBs) are based on a multidisciplinary approach. Developing a state-of-the-art SUB-system based on quality by design (QbD) principles requires broad expertise and know-how including the cell culture application, polymer chemistry, regulatory requirements, and a deep understanding of the biopharmaceutical industry. Using standardized products reduces the complexity and strengthens the robustness of the supply chain. Well-established supplier relations including risk mitigation strategies are the basis for achieving long-term security of supply. Well-developed quality systems including change control approaches aligned with the requirements of the biopharmaceutical industry are a key factor in supporting long-term product availability.

Using three supply factors specific to a country - supply environment, supply infrastructure, absorptive capacity, we construct a rating system representing the potential of a nation to attract foreign direct investment (FDI). We use the combinatorics- and Boolean-based logical analysis of data (LAD) method to capture the individual and combined impact of the supply factors on the FDI inflow. The LAD classification system is shown to be robust, cross-validating very well, thereby allowing its use for prediction purposes, and permitting the derivation of a rating system that can have various granularity levels. By linking FDI potential with supply capability related factors, the findings of this research contribute to future FDI decisions by firms as well as provide assistance and direction to strategic planners of countries that seek to enhance their attractiveness as FDI destinations. As technology matures, production processes start to lack differentiation and firms look to establish facilities globally to become more competitive.

Such devices are often termed tandem or multi-junction solar cells. The larger number of different materials and processing steps involved in their making when compared with the single junction solar cell has to be justified and compensated by a higher efficiency. A central question to ask is how much energy you need to invest in a system in order for it to produce energy and return the investment at least once and preferably a number of times. As an initial investigation into the potential viability of the tandem or multi-junction approach we have engaged in a detailed analysis based on the manufacturing energy for each step within the tandem module supply chain for full ambient processing of thin flexible polymer tandem solar cells prepared entirely by roll processing methods. We present a comprehensive overview of relevant research results on how the energy consumption affects the energy balance when using single and multi-junction solar cells. Based on the above question we calculate the minimum efficiency that the tandem or multi-junction should present to determine the minimum energy payback time: that is whether (or when) the increase in materials use and complexity of the tandem architecture is compensated by better performance. After analysing the performance and the consideration of a series of technical improvement opportunities, we project that the tandem solar cell has to be similar to 20% higher performing than the corresponding single junction solar cell to be warranted. We also highlight that there is a range in the reciprocal EBPT-efficiency relationship where the tandem solar cell is an advantage. Specific to polymer and organic solar cells are however that they embody very little energy and this implies that the single junction may be an advantage, especially in cases where land mass is not critical.

The problem involves concepts from different fields including production planning, manufacturing flexibility, forecasting, and marketing. In this paper, the gaps in the existing literature are first illustrated. With the goal of addressing the identified research gaps, agent-based modeling and simulation is employed to analyze the performance of different production planning strategies under various levels of volume flexibility and consumer social network structures. The key distinguishing feature of the developed model is the capability of the manufacturing firm to adjust its production level by forecasting the future demand. The analysis of the simulation outputs yields substantial results by challenging some intuitive and traditional understandings of manufacturing systems. The paper also provides a discussion on managerial implications of the results in order to provide the managers with guidelines on the implementation of the model in real-world diffusion environments.","[Negahban, A.] Auburn Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Yilmaz, L.; Nall, T.] Auburn Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Software Engn, Auburn, AL 36849 USA","Negahban, A (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",anegahban@auburn.edu,,"Negahban, Ashkan/0000-0003-3393-3395",,,,42,18,19,0,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

On the other hand, they need to cut supply costs to gain a competitive edge. This paper proposes Green DEA (GDEA), a comprehensive approach based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) with carbon footprint monitoring. GDEA builds on an existing DEA model with weight restrictions and dual role factors, and introduces carbon footprints as necessary dual role factors with weight restrictions. Unlike other researches, GDEA incorporates heterogeneous suppliers and also takes into account regional emission compliance standards and laws. GDEA encourages suppliers to go green and cut down their carbon footprints and comply with emission norms along with reducing costs in order to survive competition. Results from model validation in a well-known automobile spare parts manufacturer in India are presented to verify the GDEA approach. Overall, GDEA cuts across a huge and varied supplier base, caters to almost all businesses, is environment-friendly and robust. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, new affordable and deployable technologies and microsensors have recently appeared and keep maturing. This paper discusses the needs and the possibilities that exist for leveraging these technologies and sensors with RFID to guarantee continuous and seamless visibility of all assets (fixed and mobile resources and field personnel) of smart enterprises, thereby expanding and complementing the roles of RFID. It examines the design challenges for the integration of these technologies for advanced logistics operations at the level of product classes or their instances.

The responsibility of producers to extend and reverse SCs is a critical and timely topic that captures increasing concerns over the way firms can adapt their business models to interlinking technical, socio-economic and environmental frameworks. This is particularly true when producers are not also reuse/recycle actors. By performing a critical review of the scientific literature on this field, this article develops nine elemental factors that can be considered for assessing the impacts of collaborative strategies as a means to implement extended producer responsibility (EPR) in open-loop SCs. The resulting conceptual framework provides EPR implementation guidance under different market conditions.

As niche-innovations local food networks induce socio-ecological changes on the local level and they have the potential to foster wider transformations of the dominant food regime. Many local food networks adopt the concept of food sovereignty as a kind of leitmotif. At the core of this concept lies the question of how to create an agro-food system that, (i) allows for democratic participation and civic engagement in food production, and (ii) sets up new relationships that avoid social inequity and the exploitation of both humans and nature. In this paper we shed light on how the Austrian local food network SpeiseLokal addresses the challenge of operationalizing the concept of food sovereignty. The case study captures the strategies which local food networks embark on and depicts the difficulties they encounter. The paper aims to identify critical points of intersection that either strengthen or constrain local food networks from becoming established, operating, and up-scaling in the ways they wish; that is, in accordance with the principles and aims of food sovereignty, while avoiding a later assimilation into the dominant food regime.","[Lutz, Juliana] Alpen Adria Univ, Inst Social Ecol Vienna SEC, A-1070 Vienna, Austria; [Schachinger, Judith] SpeiseLokal, A-3034 Maria Anzbach, Austria","Lutz, J (corresponding author), Alpen Adria Univ, Inst Social Ecol Vienna SEC, Schottenfeldgasse 29, A-1070 Vienna, Austria.",Julia.Lutz@aau.at; judith@speiselokal.at,,,ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [263522 LUISE],Co-funding from the ERC 263522 LUISE for writing this paper is gratefully acknowledged.,,62,27,27,1,39,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2013,5,11,,,,,4778,4796,,10.3390/su5114778,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,276ZY,WOS:000328789400014,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

Much of the research published in the pages of Production and Operations Management deals with management under uncertainty. The shared concerns over the impacts of multiple types of uncertainty suggest that research on Operations Management (OM) can play a role in the development of theory in entrepreneurship. We discuss aspects of such a role from two perspectives. First, we consider several topics in the OM literature that have clear applications or parallels in entrepreneurship. These topics include innovation, the management of technology, new product development, flexibility, and hedging strategies. Understanding these topical connections should aid in the development of tools and applications central to the practice of entrepreneurship. On another level, when we consider how the approaches to many of these topics in OM are grounded in theory adapted from Operations Research and Economics we argue that these same roots can be used as starting points for the development of theory in entrepreneurship. As examples, we will argue that the theoretical bases supporting robust optimization, stochastic dynamic programming, and even Total Quality Management can also serve as foundations of theories about the roles, practice, and behaviors of entrepreneurs.","[Phan, Phillip; Chambers, Chester] Johns Hopkins Univ, Carey Business Sch, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA","Phan, P (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Carey Business Sch, 100 Int Dr, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA.",pphan@jhu.edu; cchamber@jhu.edu,"Phan, Phillip/AAH-1561-2019; Phan, Phillip/I-8847-2014","Phan, Phillip/0000-0002-1366-1604",,,,39,10,10,0,32,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1059-1478,1937-5956,,PROD OPER MANAG,Prod.

The problem is initially casted as a two-level organizational decision process: the design decisions must be made here and now, but the reengineered SCN can be used for daily operations only after an implementation period. The network structure can also be adapted during the planning horizon considered. When making the design decisions, the operational response and structural adaptation decisions taking place during the planning horizon must be anticipated. The methodology recognizes three event types to characterize the future SCN environment: random, hazardous and deep uncertainty events. At the design time, plausible futures are anticipated through a scenario planning approach. Several Monte Carlo scenario samples are generated and corresponding sample average approximation programs are solved in order to produce a set of alternative designs. A multi-criteria design evaluation approach is then applied to select the most effective and robust design among candidate solutions. An illustrative case, based on the location-transportation problem, is finally introduced to illustrate the approach, and computational experiments are performed to demonstrate its feasibility.","[Klibi, Walid; Martel, Alain] Interuniv Res Ctr Enterprise Networks Logist & Tr, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Klibi, Walid] Kedge Business Sch, Operat Management & Informat Syst Dept, Talence, France; [Martel, Alain] Univ Laval, Fac Sci Adm, Dept Operat & Syst Decis, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada","Klibi, W (corresponding author), Kedge Business Sch, Operat Management & Informat Syst Dept, Talence, France.",walid.klibi@bem.edu,,,NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [DNDPJ 335078-05]; Defence RD Canada; Modellium Inc.,"This research was supported in part by NSERC (Grant No DNDPJ 335078-05), Defence R&D Canada and Modellium Inc.",,59,24,25,1,48,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0171-6468,1436-6304,,OR SPECTRUM,OR Spectrum,NOV,2013,35,4,,,,,867,903,,10.1007/s00291-013-0327-6,,,37,Operations Research & Management Science,Operations Research & Management Science,255CP,WOS:000327217200005,,,,,2021-03-04

Environmental, economic and social implications of the whole supply chain of products, both goods and services, their use and waste management, i.e. their entire life cycle from cradle to grave have to be considered to achieve more sustainable production and consumption patterns. Progress toward sustainability requires enhancing the methodologies for integrated assessment and mainstreaming of life cycle thinking from product development to strategic policy support. Life cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle costing (LCC) and social LCA (sLCA) already attempt to cover sustainability pillars, notwithstanding different levels of methodological development. An increasing concern on how to deal with the complexity of sustainability has promoted the development of life cycle sustainability frameworks. As a contribution to the ongoing scientific debate after the Rio+20 conference, this paper aims to present and discuss the state of the art of life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA), giving recommendations for its further development in line with ontological, epistemological and methodological aspects of sustainability science. Building on the review about the state of the art of sustainability science and sustainability assessment methods presented in part I, this paper discuss LCA, LCC, sLCA and LCSA against ontological, epistemological and methodological aspects of ongoing scientific debate on sustainability. Strengths and weaknesses of existing life cycle-based methodologies and methods are presented. Besides, existing frameworks for LCSA are evaluated against the criteria defined in part I in order to highlight coherence with sustainability science progress and to support better integration and mainstreaming of sustainability concepts. LCSA represents a promising approach for developing a transparent, robust and comprehensive assessment. Nevertheless, the ongoing developments should be in line with the most advanced scientific discussion on sustainability science, attempting to bridge the gaps between the current methods and methodologies for sustainability assessment. LCSA should develop so as to be hierarchically different from LCA, LCC and sLCA. It should represent the holistic approach which integrates (and not substitutes) the reductionist approach of the single part of the analysis. This implies maintaining the balance between analytical and descriptive approaches towards a goal and solution-oriented decision support methodology.","[Sala, Serenella] Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Sustainabil Assessment Unit, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, I-21027 Ispra, Varese, Italy; [Farioli, Francesca] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Interuniv Res Ctr Sustainable Dev CIRPS, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Farioli, Francesca] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Zamagni, Alessandra] Italian Natl Agcy New Technol Energy & Sustainabl, LCA & Ecodesign Lab, I-40129 Bologna, Italy","Sala, S (corresponding author), Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Sustainabil Assessment Unit, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Via Enrico Fermi 2749,TP 270, I-21027 Ispra, Varese, Italy.",serenella.sala@jrc.ec.europa.eu,,"Sala, Serenella/0000-0003-1919-9948",,,,64,166,168,10,165,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0948-3349,1614-7502,,INT J LIFE CYCLE ASS,Int.

While material flow analysis (MFA) has been widely used to characterize stocks and flows along technological life cycle within a specific geographical area, trade networks among individual cycles have remained largely unexplored. Here we developed a trade-linked multilevel MFA model to map the contemporary global journey of anthropogenic aluminum. We demonstrate that the anthropogenic aluminum cycle depends substantially on international trade of aluminum in all forms and becomes highly interconnected in nature. While the Southern hemisphere is the main primary resource supplier, aluminum production and consumption concentrate in the Northern hemisphere, where we also find the largest potential for recycling. The more developed countries tend to have a substantial and increasing presence throughout the stages after bauxite refining and possess highly consumption-based cycles, thus maintaining advantages both economically and environmentally. A small group of countries plays a key role in the global redistribution of aluminum and in the connectivity of the network, which may render some countries vulnerable to supply disruption. The model provides potential insights to inform government and industry policies in resource criticality, supply chain security, value chain management, and cross-boundary environmental impacts mitigation.","[Liu, Gang] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ind Ecol Programme, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway","Liu, G (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ind Ecol Programme, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",gang.liu@ntnu.no,,"Liu, Gang/0000-0002-7613-1985",MATLAB programming,We gratefully acknowledge Stefan Pauliuk for inspiring discussion on trade analysis and support with MATLAB programming; Hugo Johansen for inputs with his master thesis at the initial stage of this paper; Darren MacKenna for support with Netmap Analytics; George Banvolgyi and Jason Rauch for providing data on bauxite ore grade; and E.

To understand the influence of operating variables on the environmental impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and water consumption, a dynamic supply chain model was linked with life cycle assessment (LCA) to produce an environmental inventory. Water is a critical natural resource, and understanding the environmental impacts of recycling water is paramount in continued development of sustainable supply chains involving water. The methodology used in this study bridged the gap between detailed process models and static LCA modeling so that operating variables beyond discrete scenario analysis could be investigated without creating unnecessarily complex models. The model performed well in evaluating environmental impacts. It was found that there was no single optimum operating regime for all environmental impacts. For a mill discharging 80 cubic meters of effluent per hour (m(3)/hour), GHGs could be minimized with a DAF capacity of 17.5 m(3)/hour, while water consumption could be minimized with a DAF capacity of 25 m(3)/hour, which allowed insight into where environmental trade-offs would occur. The study shows that more complexity can be achieved in supply chain modeling without requiring a full technical model. It also illustrates the need to consider multiple environmental impacts and highlights the trade-off of GHG emissions with water consumption in water recycling. The supply chain model used in this water treatment case study was able to identify the environmental trade-offs from the operating variables selected.","[O'Connor, Matthew; Garnier, Gil; Batchelor, Warren] Monash Univ, Australian Pulp & Paper Inst, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia","Batchelor, W (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Dept Chem Engn, POB 36, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",warren.batchelor@monash.edu,"Batchelor, Warren/A-1181-2010","Batchelor, Warren/0000-0001-6880-7765; O'Connor, Matthew/0000-0001-8887-4367",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [LP0989823],The authors would like to acknowledge funding received from the Australian Research Council Linkage Project (LP0989823) and industry partners.,,36,7,7,1,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

The most common approach for designing bi-directional networks is the independent design of reverse and forward networks. The joint integration of both networks is rarely considered. Here we study a strategic capacitated facility location problem with integrated hi-directional product flows through a network of multiple supply stages, including production allocations, uncertain data development, facility locations and flexible capacity adjustments. We extend the location and capacity problem by including the decision on the type of depot to install. Forwarding or collecting depots only process one designated direction. Hybrid sites process products of both flow directions. We first introduce a detailed deterministic model assessing the impact of incorporating reverse logistics into a forward-oriented supply chain. This is then extended to a robust capacitated facility location model, which minimizes the expectations of relative regrets for a set of scenarios over a multi-period planning horizon, while considering uncertainty regarding supplying and collecting goods. Example settings show the superior performance of the robust model compared to the deterministic model. The resulting network design mitigates the risks of higher costs and of not being able to fully satisfy demand. This is achieved at costs not significantly higher than the individual optimal solution and with solution times that are promising for applications in practice. The approach supports practitioners in assessing the flexibility of their supply chain, independent of its product flow direction, when operating under uncertainty.

Supply chain partners attempt to address schedule instability by regular exchanges of information flows on current demand and delivery forecasts. However, if these updating information flows are unreliable and likely to be over-ridden by subsequent updated schedules, then the problem of schedule instability at the supplier-customer interface is not being solved. The research hypothesis investigated in this paper is whether supply chain partners may reduce schedule instability at the supplier-customer interface by identifying and omitting complexity-adding information flows. To this aim, previous work by the authors on an information-theoretic methodology for measuring complexity is extended and applied in this paper for identifying complexity-adding information flows. The application consists of comparing the complexity index of actual exchanged information flows with the complexity index of scenarios that omit one or more of these information flows. Using empirical results, it is shown that supply chain partners may reduce schedule instability at the supplier-customer interface by identifying and omitting complexity-adding information flows. The applied methodology is independent of the information systems used by the supplier and customer, and it provides an objective, integrative measure of schedule instability at the supplier-customer interface. Two case studies are presented, one in the commodity production environment of fast-moving consumer goods, and another in the customised production environment of electronic products sector. By applying the measurement and analysis methodology, relevant schedule instability-related insights about the specific case-studies are obtained. In light of the findings from these case studies, areas for further research and validation of the conditions in which the proposed research hypothesis holds are also proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we present a framework depicting interactions between supply chain strategy and design, product design and development, and market strategy. Using the framework we undertake case studies of SMEs to better understand the importance of an integrated product-market-supply chain strategy. We empirically examine what decisions were made for market-entry and product innovations with regard to supply chain design, how they were implemented, and what the implications were for the firms' product success. It is revealed that SMEs do not typically consider their supply chain strategy before product introduction, and consequently experience supply chain problems that are likely to be detrimental to the firms' growth potentials. The results also support the theoretical proposition that proactive and pre-emptive involvement of suppliers and supply chain strategy would lead to a more robust strategic direction for growth, and contribute to extending the literature on the role and impact of supply chain and suppliers in product and market-entry innovations, with a focus on SMEs.

The importance value of each supplier with respect to each product is obtained via fuzzy TOPSIS in the first stage. Then in the second stage, these values are used as an input in the mathematical model which determines the suppliers and the quantities of products to be provided from the related suppliers.

Thus, it is essential that the built environment is able to withstand the possible earthquake events that may occur, and to continue to operate and function. Failure to do so would result in significant economic losses. This study presents the latter stages of a multi-tiered probabilistic earthquake loss estimation model for Greater Cairo and builds upon previous studies of the seismic hazard. In order to assess possible damage to the built environment, and the resulting economic losses, the vulnerability of the built environment is first evaluated. Through the use of satellite images, Egypts building census, previous studies and field surveys, a building-stock inventory is compiled. This building inventory is classified according to structural type and height, and is geocoded by district. Using existing fragility curves, the vulnerability of the building stock is assessed. In addition, the vulnerability of both the electricity and natural gas networks are assessed, through the use of fragility curves, cut sets and an evaluation of the supply networks. Based on the assessment of direct losses, the losses associated with building damage far exceed those associated with the considered network infrastructure. A macro-economic model is developed that takes into account damage to the built environment and provides estimates of indirect economic losses, as well as enabling the identification of the optimal recovery process. Using this model, it is shown that the indirect losses can exceed direct losses for extreme scenarios where the economy is brought to a near standstill. The framework developed and presented herein can be extended to include more networks, and is also applicable to other regions.","[Dorra, Elkhayam M.; Stafford, Peter J.; Elghazouli, Ahmed Y.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, England","Stafford, PJ (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, England.",p.stafford@imperial.ac.uk,,"Elghazouli, Ahmed/0000-0002-0038-7415; Stafford, Peter/0000-0003-0988-8934",Ministry of Electricity; Ministry of Housing; Ministry of Petroleum in Egypt,"The authors would like to acknowledge the support and information provided by Dr. Ahmed Moharram and the Ministries of Electricity, Housing and Petroleum in Egypt.

By drawing on the concept of resilience in ecological systems and in supply chains, resilience in industrial ecosystems is specified on the basis of a system's ability to maintain eco-efficient material and energy flows under disruptions. Using a network model that captures supply, asset, and organizational dependencies and propagation of disruptions among firms, the resilience, and particularly resistance as an important dimension of resilience, of two real industrial ecosystems and generalized specifications are examined. The results show that an industrial ecosystem is less resistant and less resilient with high inter-firm dependency, preferentially organized physical exchanges, and under disruptions targeted at highly connected firms. An industrial ecosystem with more firms and exchanges is less resistant, but has more eco-efficient flows and potentials, and therefore is less likely to lose its function of eco-efficiency. Taking these determinants for resilience into consideration improves the adaptability of an industrial ecosystem, which helps increase its resilience. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, this approach does not provide a faithful thermodynamic evaluation of the overall energy conversion processes that occur in buildings, and a more robust approach should be followed. The exergy analysis is a useful method that combines First Law and Second Law perspectives and has been applied in many related engineering fields, power plants analysis, CHP systems, heat pumps or building energy systems. In this study, the overall energy and exergy performance of eight space heating options is compared for different outdoor environmental conditions. The methodology follows an approach from demand (at building envelope) to supply side (primary energy supplied), assuming that each energy supply network (ESN) or heating option is divided into the following sub-systems: room, emission, heat generator and power plant. The related energy and exergy performance of each ESN is evaluated through the following indicators: primary energy ratio (PER) and primary exergy ratio (PExR). The results show that for similar primary energy performance, PExR may assume distinct values depending on outdoor environmental conditions. The most energy efficient ESN has a PER of 2.2, while the related PExR changes from 7% to 16% for Lisbon and Berlin, respectively. Furthermore, the assessment of irreversibility rate associated to each ESN sub-system reveals the sources of inefficiencies could be pinpointed and measured, leading to tangible suggestions for further improvements.

Lean firms consistently apply well-defined tools and the relationship between implementation of these tools and improved performance is well-established in the literature. Many lean practices, such as standardized work and visual cues, reduce variability, increase productivity, and make problems more visible which can create a culture where disruptions occur less often. Although there is evidence that lean implementation leads to reduced disruptions, a question that remains unresolved is why these lean management tools lead to fewer disruptions and whether conditions such as the level of complexity and inventory in the system predict the successful application of these lean practices. Because many of the firms that adopt lean management can be characterized as complex work systems, we draw insights from literature on complex organizations operating in environments that are inherently perilous. Two constructs that are addressed in this literature are fundamental to the concept of lean management - interactive complexity and tight coupling or organizational slack. We argue that theory that applies to complex organizations provides a lens for viewing how lean management firms avoid disruptions and conclude that the theoretical basis for lean management lies in understanding how to overcome the complexity inherent in these systems to achieve disruption-free performance.","[Marley, Kathryn A.] Duquesne Univ, Palumbo Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15282 USA; [Marley, Kathryn A.] Duquesne Univ, Donahue Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15282 USA; [Ward, Peter T.] Ohio State Univ, Fisher Coll Business, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Marley, KA (corresponding author), Duquesne Univ, Palumbo Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15282 USA.",marleyk@duq.edu; ward.1@osu.edu,,,,,,56,11,11,1,66,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1936-9735,,,OPER MANAGE RES,Oper.

Facilities that are located in this article concurrently satisfy both traditional objective functions and reliability considerations in CLSC network designs. To attack this problem, a novel mathematical model is developed that integrates the network design decisions in both forward and reverse supply chain networks. The model also utilizes an effective reliability approach to find a robust network design. In order to make the results of this article more realistic, a CLSC for a case study in the iron and steel industry has been explored. The considered CLSC is multi-echelon, multi-facility, multi-product and multi-supplier. Furthermore, multiple facilities exist in the reverse logistics network leading to high complexities. Since the collection centres play an important role in this network, the reliability concept of these facilities is taken into consideration. To solve the proposed model, a novel interactive hybrid solution methodology is developed by combining a number of efficient solution approaches from the recent literature. The proposed solution methodology is a bi-objective interval fuzzy possibilistic chance-constraint mixed integer linear programming (BOIFPCCMILP). Finally, computational experiments are provided to demonstrate the applicability and suitability of the proposed model in a supply chain environment and to help decision makers facilitate their analyses.","[Vahdani, Behnam; Tavakkoli-Moghaddam, Reza; Jolai, Fariborz] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Baboli, Arman] Inst Natl Sci Appl, DISP Lab, F-69621 Villeurbanne, France","Vahdani, B (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran.",b.vahdani@gmail.com,"Baboli, Armand/A-5221-2015; jolai, fariborz/B-4406-2012; Tavakkoli-Moghaddam, Reza/P-1948-2015","Baboli, Armand/0000-0003-0542-3566; jolai, fariborz/0000-0003-0824-8513; Tavakkoli-Moghaddam, Reza/0000-0002-6757-926X",,,,43,48,48,1,81,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-215X,,,ENG OPTIMIZ,Eng.

The contamination of the treated water within distribution system leads to frequent outbreaks of waterborne diseases. This demands a proactive approach that is based on risk assessment and a management methodology to ensure water safety. In this context, the paper presents a model study undertaken for the water supply network of a pilot area in Hyderabad city, India. The risk assessment methodology uses geospatial databases of the water supply network, sewer network, open drains, groundwater table, pressure in pipes, and soil data with a number of system-specific attributes. Fuzzy multi-criteria evaluation approach with qualitative and quantitative domain knowledge is employed in pipe condition assessment model. The physical parameters viz, pipe age, material, diameter; operational parameters viz. intermittency, number of breaks and bursts, and leakage in the system; and environmental parameters viz, workmanship, bedding condition, and traffic determine the vulnerability of pipes to contaminant intrusion. The zones of contamination formed in the soil near open drains and sewer crossings (i.e., hazards) are delineated using a contaminant ingress model. The risk of contaminant intrusion is assessed as a function of vulnerability and hazard. The results indicate that roughly 3% of pipes in the network are in Bad condition and require rehabilitation on a priority basis; about 46% of pipes are in Medium condition. The study describes a techno-economically feasible approach to assist water managers and policy makers in delivering safe drinking water. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, manufacturers operate in ever more complex and volatile environments.

It empirically examines these relationships using archival and survey data from 126 manufacturers. The results show that environmental complexity positively moderates the effects of lean operations and lean purchasing on performance. However, environmental dynamism reduces the benefits of lean operations on performance, but enhances the benefits of lean purchasing on performance. Robustness tests further confirm the contingent effects of complexity and dynamism on lean operations and lean purchasing. This research offers a more nuanced understanding of the effect of external environmental context on lean practices, and suggests that practitioners should carefully consider the external environment when implementing different types of lean practices.

However, the majority of the US economy's climate, water, and pollution impacts are the result of complex supply chains, strung together to deliver value-added products and services. To mitigate these indirect impacts (by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, for example) and adapt to new risks, leading companies must engage with upstream suppliers and embed sustainability as a joint objective. Companies failing to do so may suffer damage to their reputations and operations. In a changing climate, increasingly frequent and severe weather events are making supply networks more vulnerable to disruptions and unanticipated costs. Investors and other stakeholders are responding by pressuring companies to disclose and quantify emissions and other supply chain environmental impacts. Despite significant progress made by some corporations in reducing their emissions and their exposure to potential hazards hidden in upstream operations, sustainability must be a society-wide effort.","[Smith, Timothy M.] Univ Minnesota, NorthStar Initiat Sustainable Enterprise, Inst Environm, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Smith, Timothy M.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Smith, TM (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, NorthStar Initiat Sustainable Enterprise, Inst Environm, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",,,"Smith, Timothy/0000-0002-0479-4261",,,,36,6,7,2,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0096-3402,1938-3282,,B ATOM SCI,Bull.

Although many strategies for flexible management of a supply network have been proposed, especially for mitigating supply network risks, it still remains unclear how to apply the strategies to a supply network and how to reconfigure the supply network. This paper examines the influence of flexibility strategies in a dynamic global market environment on the structure of supply network, and proposes a method of reconfiguring the supply network of an enterprise to cope with its flexibility strategies. A reconfigurable supply network model is proposed, and flexibility strategies are classified, and critical indices of strategies are defined. In the proposed model, each business actor is defined as a network node and each node has its own goal. A node optimizes its goal to reduce and overcome the risk of market environments. The result of optimization indicates that the supply network structure is reconfigured dynamically. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The model includes a general network structure considering both forward and reverse processes that can be used in various industries, such as electronics, digital equipment, and vehicles. Because logistic network design is a time consuming and costly project as well as a strategic and sensitive decision (i.e. the change of such decision is difficult in the future), a robust optimisation approach is adopted to cope with the uncertainty of demand and the return rate described by a finite set of possible scenarios. Hence, to obtain robust solutions with better time, the scenario relaxation algorithm is employed for the proposed model. Numerical examples and a sensitivity analysis are presented to demonstrate the significance and applicability of the presented model. It is shown that solutions resulted from the suggested approach insure more situations, especially in worst case ones. The results show that although the profit values of the robust configuration are less than the deterministic configuration, the robust configuration is more reliable than the deterministic one because the deterministic configuration is infeasible under some demand and return rates (i.e. in the worst cases). Moreover, the results show the computing time superiority of the algorithm compared to the extensive form model as well as optimality of the resulted solutions.","[Ramezani, Majid; Bashiri, Mahdi] Shahed Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Tavakkoli-Moghaddam, Reza] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran","Bashiri, M (corresponding author), Shahed Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran.",bashiri@shahed.ac.ir,"Bashiri, Mahdi/S-2144-2017; Tavakkoli-Moghaddam, Reza/P-1948-2015","Bashiri, Mahdi/0000-0002-5448-1773; Tavakkoli-Moghaddam, Reza/0000-0002-6757-926X",,,,39,55,59,2,63,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0268-3768,1433-3015,,INT J ADV MANUF TECH,Int.

It is, therefore, essential for transport network planners and operators to identify sections within the network which, if broken, have a considerable negative impact on the network's performance. Research on transport network analysis provides lots of different approaches and models in order to identify such critical sections. Most of them, however, are only applicable to mono-modal transport networks and calculate indices which represent the criticality of sections by using aggregated data. The model presented, in contrast, focuses on the analysis of intermodal transport networks by using a traffic micro simulation. Based on available, real-life data, our approach models a transport network as well as its actual traffic participants and their individual decisions in case of a disruption. The resulting transport delay time due to a specific disruption helps to identify critical sections and critical networks, as a whole. Therefore, the results are a valuable decision support for transport network planners and operators in order to make the infrastructure less vulnerable, more attractive for carriers and thus more economically sustainable. In order to show the applicability of the model we analyse the Austrian intermodal transport network and show how critical sections can be evaluated by this approach. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The objective is to facilitate the decision-making when the management faces the dilemma of implementing either a strategy of early large-scale investments to benefit from economies of scale and capacity readiness, or a flexible strategy of low volume but more frequent capacity expansions. We consider a CLSC with two sequential product-types. We study the system's response in terms of transient flows, actual/desired capacity level, capacity expansions/contractions and total supply chain profit, employing a simulation-based system dynamics optimization approach. Extensive numerical investigation covers a broad range of real-world remanufacturable products under alternative scenarios in relation to the market preference over product-types. The key findings propose flexible policies as improved alternatives to large-scale capacity expansions/contractions in terms of adaptability to the actual pattern of end-of-use product returns and involved risk in the investments' turnover. Flexible policies are also proposed as practices to avoid overcapacity phenomena in collection and remanufacturing capacity and as robust policies to product demand. Their implementation is revealed to be even more important for the case of remanufacturing, when a high capacity acquisition unit-cost ratio (remanufacturing/collection) is coupled with strong economies of scale. Finally, results under different information sharing structures show changes in remanufacturing policies, thus justifying the importance of coordination between the decision-maker and the distributor.

Such development can be fostered by a regional innovation system (RIS), although the risks of path dependency and lock-in may lead to a region decaying. A process for contributing to a RIS is the Regional Development Platform Model (RDPM), the focus of this paper. As a new approach to regional development, the RDPM is utilised and adapted to identify opportunities for potential development in a region. In this paper, the RDPM is linked to the role of a port authority and its potential to drive regional growth centred on its innovation network. Port authorities, by assuming the role of network leader, can shape the regional innovation network and create new development trajectories through their links to various levels of government and the wide range of stakeholders that utilise the port facilities. The inherent tensions in this role and the competing possibilities of path creation and path dependence to create value for a wide network of stakeholders are challenging. The paper investigates the use of the RDPM and how port authorities can influence development strategies for mutual benefit in this context. More specifically, a case study of the Burnie Port in Tasmania, Australia is conducted by utilising desktop research, interviews, an expert panel and industry roundtable to demonstrate that the RDPM has the potential as an approach beyond analysing the main sources of path dependency in a local region. By following the adaptation of the RDPM, it is argued that the trajectory of path dependency can be interrupted, for example by a port authority, enabling the potential for new paths to be created.

The bullwhip effect problem of supply chain systems with vendor order placement lead time delays in an uncertain environment is addressed in this paper. Among the numerous causes of bullwhip effect, we focus on uncertainties with respect to demand, production process, supply chain structure, inventory policy implementation and especially vendor order placement lead time delays. Minimizing the negative effect of these uncertainties in inducing bullwhip effect creates a need for developing dynamical inventory policy that increases responsiveness to demand and decreases volatility in inventory replenishment. First, a dynamic model of supply chain with above uncertainties is developed. Then, a novel uncertainty-dependent robust inventory control method using inventory position information is proposed. Additionally, the maximum allowable vendor order placement lead time delay that ensures the stability of supply chains and the suppression of bullwhip effect under the proposed inventory control policy is explored and measured. We find that vendor order placement lead time delays do play important role in supply chain dynamics and contribute to its turbulence and volatility. The effectiveness and flexibility of proposed method is verified through simulation study. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Specifically, the role of closed-loop supply chain management is examined as a means for creating resource advantages that can lead to marketplace competitive advantages. Design/methodology/approach - The research extends previous theoretical research, integrating natural resource scarcity and closed-loop supply chain management for the first time. Resource-advantage theory is employed as the theoretical lens for the research model and propositions. Findings - The findings deepen understanding of the forces that create natural resource scarcity conditions in the supply chain, and highlight the need for higher order closed-loop capabilities that have the ability to mitigate natural resource scarcity. Research limitations/implications - The theoretical model and six research propositions suggest relationships between natural resource scarcity, closed-loop capabilities, and firm level performance that need to be tested empirically. Future research opportunities and methodologies are suggested. Practical implications - Growing natural resource scarcity is already having a major impact on many firms and industries; therefore, this research has significant managerial implications due to supply risks and potential disruptions caused by insufficient natural resources in current and future supply chains. Originality/value - This paper seeks to increase discussion about natural resource scarcity and bring it into focus as a relevant supply chain topic related to closed-loop supply chain capabilities and the internal firm level resources needed to ensure performance in a changing world.","[Bell, John E.; Mollenkopf, Diane A.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Mkt & Supply Chain Management, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Stolze, Hannah J.] Florida State Univ, Dept Mkt, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Bell, JE (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Mkt & Supply Chain Management, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",bell@utk.edu,"Mollenkopf, Diane A/N-9582-2014","Mollenkopf, Diane A/0000-0003-0944-0806",,,,155,46,45,4,40,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0960-0035,1758-664X,,INT J PHYS DISTR LOG,Int.

Since the reasons for outsourcing success and failure are underexplored this research aims to investigate the role of contractual completeness and complementary enforcement practices such as cooperation and monitoring and sanctioning practices under varying risk scenarios. Critically, these relationships are examined in the context of two serious risks: legal risk in the guise of rule of law and supplier non-conformance risk. Design/methodology/approach - Cross-county, survey data was collected through the global manufacturing research group and combined with secondary data from the World Bank. The authors carried out a series of regression analysis to explore their research questions. Findings - The results indicate that risk is a critical component of outsourcing success with legal risk reducing outsourcing performance on both cost and quality and supplier risk reducing outsourcing performance on quality. The results also indicate that these outcomes can be mitigated in some settings via complete contracts and complementary practices. These findings are likely to be generalized throughout the supply chain and are of relevance beyond the dyad. Originality/value - In the realm of supply chain practices this study presents a comprehensive attempt to assess the importance of risk and complementary practices for the success of outsourcing contracts. Furthermore, it assesses the role of contextual factors such as risk and the rule of law.","[Wiengarten, Frank] Ramon Llull Univ, ESADE Sch Business, Dept Operat & Innovat, Barcelona, Spain; [Pagell, Mark] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Fynes, Brian] UCD Business Sch, Dublin, Ireland","Wiengarten, F (corresponding author), Ramon Llull Univ, ESADE Sch Business, Dept Operat & Innovat, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Fynes, Brian/AAL-5505-2020","Fynes, Brian/0000-0002-6591-8432",,,,65,22,22,2,58,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1359-8546,1758-6852,,SUPPLY CHAIN MANAG,Supply Chain Manag.,,2013,18,6,,,,,630,643,,10.1108/SCM-03-2013-0071,,,14,Business; Management,Business & Economics,252KK,WOS:000327003400005,,,,,2021-03-04

It involves a characterization of SCN hazards in terms of multihazards, vulnerability sources and exposure levels; the estimation of incident arrival, intensity and duration processes; and the assessment of SCN hit consequences in terms of damage and time to recovery.

Governance of such socio-economic-ecological networks plays a strong role in determining their resilience. Social processes of governance, such as collaboration between communities, can be systematically assessed through the existence and strength of connections between actors and their embeddedness in the broader socio-economic network by social network analysis (SNA). This paper examines how network governance of the tourism industry-dependent Swiss Gotthard region relates to resilience to climate change by SNA. The paper argues that economic diversification and a network structure supporting stability, flexibility, and innovation increase regional resilience to climate change. The Gotthard network has a high diversification capability due to high cohesion and close collaboration, limited innovative capacity by the existence of only two subgroups, and considerable flexibility through the centralized structure. Main weaknesses are a low density, uneven distribution of power, and a lack of integration of some supply chain sectors into the overall network.","[Luthe, Tobias; Wyss, Romano] Univ Appl Sci HTW Chur, Inst Tourism & Leisure Res, CH-7000 Chur, Switzerland; [Schuckert, Markus] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Sch Hotel & Tourism Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Luthe, T (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci HTW Chur, Inst Tourism & Leisure Res, Comercialstr 22, CH-7000 Chur, Switzerland.",tobias.luthe@htwchur.ch,"Schuckert, Markus/F-1166-2014","Schuckert, Markus/0000-0003-1912-8672; Luthe, Tobias/0000-0002-4748-3885",EU Interreg ClimAlpTour; Swiss Network of International Studies (SNIS),"We woud like to acknowledge the project funding by EU Interreg ClimAlpTour and by Swiss Network of International Studies (SNIS), as well as to support by Ulrik Brandes and Bobo Nick, University of Konstanz.",,68,65,66,8,121,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Then, for coping with uncertain parameters effectively, a novel possibilistic programming approach, called robust possibilistic programming (RPP), is proposed. Several varieties of RPP models are developed and their differences, weaknesses, strengths and the most suitable conditions for being used are discussed. A real industrial case study is provided to illustrate the performance and applicability of the proposed RPP models in practice. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Pishvaee, M.

In turn, these types of green projects contribute directly to the bottom line. Using detailed reports of 79 environmental projects that took place in manufacturing organizations in the Province of Quebec over the last decade; this paper examines the influence of four project characteristics on the project's financial outcome. The results suggest that projects related to the main product or its underlying production process (as opposed to peripheral projects) can be financially more beneficial despite their disruptive nature. Evidence was also found that green projects involving changes in the management systems are more profitable than the ones that entail a structural transformation. Finally, a positive linkage between organizational size and project's financial performance has been supported, as larger organizations have more capabilities to implement such green initiatives.

The problem is multi-criteria in nature, and a variety of multi-criteria decision making methodologies have been proposed. However, most of them did not take into account the interrelationships among the critical success factors and the fuzziness of the data involved in deciding the preferences of the factors. The objective of this research is to propose a fuzzy analytic network process model to evaluate various aspects of suppliers. With the consultation with the experts, the proposed model can consider the feedback and interdependency of factors in a network, and the factors are pairwise compared under an uncertain environment. The weights of factors can be calculated, and the final priority of suppliers obtained. Semiconductor industry becomes increasingly globalize competitive nowadays, and a good supply chain relationship is essential for a company to survive and to acquire reasonable profit. Thus, a case study of IC packaging company selection in Taiwan is presented, and the proposed model is applied to facilitate the decision process. The priorities of the factors and the ranking of the suppliers can be a recommendation or reference for decision makers when making a supplier evaluation and selection decision.","[Lee, Amy H.

The rapidly increasing sales of EEE worldwide, constitutes the rational management of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) a matter of critical importance, both in economic and environmental terms. Taking into account that reverse logistics is one of the most important parameters in the management of waste equipment, it is particularly important for the manufacturers to control relevant cost in order to be market competitive. One of the most critical decisions regarding reverse logistics costs is the type of carrier to be used. To this end, this paper presents a multicriteria optimisation model for multi-type carriers of WEEE, based on multiple objective linear programming (MOLP). The main goal of a MOLP model is the weighted optimisation of different objectives. In our case. the proposed MOLP approach minimises total logistics costs, consumption of fossil fuel and production of emissions due to transportation of WEEE with the use of different types of containers. The model embodies existing infrastructure in collection points and recycling facilities and targets towards optimisation of the reverse logistics network for a single planning period by taking into account both economic and environmental aspects of the problem under study.

If successfully managed, supplier relationships may support the firm's strategic orientation and become a sustainable advantage on the global market. A key question is thus how the firm can develop and maintain such relationships. The market-driving strategy has recently been advanced as a more pro-active type of market orientation that aims to reconfigure the supply chain, change the nature of competition and the values of the customers. We especially investigate how market-driving firms can develop their supplier relationships so that they actively support this strategy. We present a set of propositions that specify factors critical for the development of the market-driving firm's supplier relationships and develop a theoretical framework that specifies how these different factors interact in order to strengthen the market-driving orientation of a supplier relationship.

The model uses both the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Analytic Network Process (ANP) as its basis. Once the generic decision model is defined, an example application is described to show its use and feasibility. The robustness of the solution is demonstrated using sensitivity analysis, allowing the decision maker to appreciate the complexities in this decision environment.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a strategic-tactical decision support model to assist managers in evaluating the impact of environmental issues, related to transportation emissions, on the transport geography of a region. Specifically we provide a model that addresses: (i) supply chain network design, including port of entry and transportation mode, and (ii) decisions on using dedicated versus shared warehouses and transportation. The applicability of the proposed methodology is examined through the development of a sustainable supply chain network in the South-Eastern Europe region. The results indicate that in most cases using shared warehouses from Third Party Logistics operators improves both the cost and the environmental performance of a company. In all cases shared use of transportation operations minimizes the amount of CO2 and PM emissions generated, while dedicated use minimizes costs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The sector operated efficiently, utilizing then-current technologies. Since, the water supply and sanitation sector has experienced a steady but devastating decline. Aging infrastructure, poorly maintained equipment, leaking water and sewer networks, and low technical capacity and morale are some of the key problems of the sector. The lack of funding led to insufficient imports, lack of maintenance, and curtailment of needed expansion. These services were surpassed by other national priorities, which resulted in a serious degradation of the quality and extent of services delivered. Diseases associated with poor sanitation, unsafe water, and unhygienic practices had increased to alarming rates. For the purpose of this study, samples were collected from eight stations along the Tigris River. The major sources of data are the Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Water Resources. Various statistical techniques, for example, student's t-test, Kendall's test, trend test, ANOVA test, are used to determine the water quality of the Tigris River. The cities lying in the outskirts of Baghdad are found in poor condition in terms of water supply and sewerage. In central Baghdad, the water treatment plants are satisfying the standard conditions but the water supply network is in a poor condition. DOI:10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000501.

These events are particularly dramatic for the small pelagic fish market, which is characterized by low prices, a low level of consumption and poor market penetration. This paper evaluates the value of the social capital network as substance of relationships among the Adriatic small pelagic fish (Engraulis encrasicolus anchovies, Sardina pilchardus sardines and Scomber scombrus mackerel) supply chain actors; starting from the definition of each marketplace role and commercial flows, the paper defines the supply chain value-system and the possibility to enhance the fishery's share value, according to increasing relationships. Applied approach of the value chain to different supply chains of the Adriatic fishery system made it possible to estimate value distribution among the phases of the chain and to understand the fishery firms competitive position. Critical aspects causing fishing firms low profitability were detected and analyzed through the Social Network Analysis (SNA). Five local small pelagic fishery systems (Manfredonia, Molfetta, Ancona, Martinsicuro and Chioggia) were studied. For each of them, small pelagic fish supply chains were defined with particular reference to the role of local fish marketplaces and operators involved. Analysis of production areas revealed profound differences both in structural aspects (fleet composition, vessels, type and structure of local fish markets, fish ranges and prices) and in the business relations and management of supply chain dealers.","[De Blasi, Giuseppe; De Boni, Annalisa; Roma, Rocco] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy; [Trevisan, Giovanna] Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, Venice, Italy","De Blasi, G (corresponding author), Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.",,"de boni, annalisa/U-9144-2017","de boni, annalisa/0000-0002-9445-1210; Roma, Rocco/0000-0001-6329-7321",,,,23,2,2,0,21,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,MAR,2012,11,1,,,,,27,32,,,,,6,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Agriculture,941NY,WOS:000303971100005,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

A two-stage stochastic programming model is developed for planning CO2 emissions disposal networks by taking into account this uncertainty. The proposed CO2 disposal network model allows us to determine where and how much captured CO2 can be held for storage, and where to sequester the given amount of CO2 among multiple potential candidates for the purpose of minimizing the total cost of handling in the face of uncertainty in CO2 sequestration demand. The proposed model is applied to a case study that examines the robustness of the model in terms of handling changing environments in the context of CO2 emissions and disposal targets in Korea.

There is a need to develop algorithms that can capture this complexity and used to solve distributed VM allocation problem in HDCF platform. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic solution to this problem that ensures mutual benefits to the CPs in a HDCF platform. We study two resource allocation games - non cooperative and cooperative games to analyze interaction among CPs in HDCF environment. We use price-based resource allocation strategies and present both centralized and distributed algorithms to find optimal solutions which have low overhead and robust performance. Various simulations were carried out to validate and verify the effectiveness of the proposed resource allocation games. The simulation results demonstrate that the cooperative scheme achieves a significant improvement in terms of performance and cost effectiveness of resource.","[Hassan, Mohammad Mehedi] King Saud Univ, Res Chair Pervas & Mobile Comp, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia; [Hassan, Mohammad Mehedi; Song, Biao; Huh, Eui-Nam] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Sarkar, A.

The key features of the ABMS model, that captures the marketplace as a complex adaptive system, are: (i) supply chain capacity is constrained; (ii) consumers' new product adoption decisions are influenced by marketing activities as well as positive and negative word-of-mouth (WOM) between consumers; (iii) interactions among consumers taking place in the context of their social network are captured at the individual level; and (iv) the new product adoption process is adaptive. Conducting over 1 million simulation experiments, we determined the best production-sales policies under various parameter combinations based on the NPV of profit generated over the diffusion process. The key findings are as follows: (1) on average, the build-up policy with delayed marketing is the preferred policy in the case of only positive WOM as well as the case of positive and negative WOM. This policy provides the highest expected NPV of profit on average and it also performs very smoothly with respect to changes in build-up periods. (2) It is critical to consider the significant impact of negative word-of-mouth in choosing production-sales policies. Neglecting the effect of negative word-of-mouth can lead to poor policy recommendations, incorrect conclusions concerning the impact of operational parameters on the policy choice, and suboptimal choice of build-up periods.

The adaptation of cognitive heuristics, which add vulnerability to judgment and decision making, creates a pressing need to identify and develop mitigation strategies to debias decision making in the supply chain management environment. The purpose of this paper is to investigate debiasing measures, corresponding contextual variables in the supplier selection process, and their implications for financial decision effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach - The authors used a large-scale empirical survey among 306 buyers to investigate the relationships among individual and organizational contextual factors, debiasing measures in the supplier selection decision, and the financial effectiveness of the supplier selection decision. Findings - It was found that organizational and individual contextual factors have differing effects on the use of debiasing approaches in the supplier selection decision. Further, the debiasing tactics can have a positive (111 the case of supplier selection task decomposing) or a negative the case of an interactional challenging of the supplier selection) impact on the financial effectiveness of the supplier selection decision. These findings suggest that supply managers must better understand the contextual factors that influence the supplier selection decision, and carefully choose the correct debiasing tactics when selecting suppliers. Originality/value - This paper relaxes the economic assumption of rational actors and addresses the need to identify and use debiasing tactics in supply chain management contexts. The research also complements the broader-based behavioral decision-making literature, which has often relied upon experimental methodologies that use undergraduate or MBA students, by employing a survey-based approach with supply managers as key informants.","[Kaufmann, Lutz; Buhrmann, Christian] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Vallendar, Germany; [Carter, Craig R.] Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Tempe, AZ USA","Kaufmann, L (corresponding author), WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Vallendar, Germany.",kaufmann@whu.edu,,,,,,87,20,20,3,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0960-0035,,,INT J PHYS DISTR LOG,Int.

Perusal of the literature shows that a broad frame of reference for reverse logistics is not adequately developed. Recent, although limited, research has begun to identify that these sustainable supply chain practices, which include the reverse logistics factors, lead to more integrated supply chains, which ultimately can lead to improved economic performance. The objectives of this paper are to: report and review various perspectives on design and development of reverse SC, planning and control issues, coordination issues, product remanufacturing and recovery strategies, understand and appreciate various mechanisms available for efficient management of reverse supply chains and identify the gaps existing in the literature. Ample opportunities exist for the growth of this field due to its multi-functional and interdisciplinary focus. It also is critical for organizations to consider from both an economic and environmental perspective. The characteristics of reverse logistics provided here can help the researchers/practitioners to advance their work in the future. Significance: The objective of this study is to encourage and provide researchers with future research directions in the field of reverse logistics for which only empirical research methods are not appropriate. In addition, the research directions suggested in the paper address several opportunities and challenges that currently face business managers & academicians operating in closed loop supply chain management.","[Jayant, Arvind; Gupta, P.] St Longowal Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Longowal, Punjab, India; [Garg, S.

In addition, inter-personal trust shows a. moderating effect on the relationship between transaction-specific investments and relationship satisfaction. Practical implications - Business relationships play a critical role in the modern market environment. Relational arrangements (based on guanxi and inter-personal trust) should be further enhanced in order to yield satisfied business relationships for SMEs in China. Originality/value - The paper extends our understanding of relationship (guanxi) marketing, as well as marketing practices for agri-food SMEs in China.","[Lu, Hualiang] Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business Adm, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Feng, Shuyi] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Trienekens, Jacques H.; Omta, S.

In this work, we propose a semantic e-Kanban inventory system where a semantic gateway is acting as a mapping hub to enable heterogeneous messages to be seamlessly exchanged between business partners on demand. The semantic gateway uses reasoning rules to map business partners' proprietary data schemas and provides interoperability required for NCM. To observe the network dynamics of our proposed system, a discrete time dynamic model is built and shows its growth to a scale-free network with a convergence rate depending on the initial connectivity of the semantic gateway and preferential attachment parameters. To analyse the proposed system from an economic perspective, analytical and numerical studies are conducted showing that it has enough potential to reduce supply chain costs in comparison to those of the traditional approach. Finally, this study attempts to address the cost-sharing issue encountered when multiple partners are direct beneficiaries of the efficiency gain through a joint network-centric capability, but it is questionable who should pay for the capability implementation. The cost-sharing issue must be investigated because most network-centric capabilities would not be economically or technically feasible for an individual company to achieve.","[Oh, Seog-Chan] Gen Motors Res & Dev, Warren, MI 48090 USA; [Shin, Jaemin] Univ Minnesota, Inst Math & Its Applicat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Oh, SC (corresponding author), Gen Motors Res & Dev, 30500 Mound Rd, Warren, MI 48090 USA.",seog-chan.oh@gm.com,,,,,,37,6,7,0,26,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

An integrated supply chain configuration (SCC) and new product diffusion (NPD) model is developed to explicitly account for the impact of demand dynamics during a new product's diffusion on an optimal supply chain configuration. Our hybrid NPD-SCC model allows a manufacturer to source from multiple suppliers, vendors or modes for its supply chain entities. Such a multiple-sourcing approach not only helps the manufacturer to diversify its pool of suppliers and maintain bargaining power, but also builds redundancy into the supply chain to hedge against potential demand surge and supply disruption during the new product life cycle. Through a case study and a comprehensive computational study, we find that although the single-sourcing solution is able to achieve lower unit-manufacturing cost (UMC), the multiple-sourcing approach is superior to single-sourcing on the overall supply chain performance in the environment with random supply disruptions. By building-in redundancy as multiple suppliers and modes, the resultant supply chain has less chance of being disrupted and achieves higher overall profit on average. We also draw several other managerial insights closing the gap between some supply chain operations and marketing strategies.","[Li, Haitao] Univ Missouri St Louis, Coll Business Adm, Dept Logist & Operat Management, St Louis, MO 63121 USA; [Amini, Mehdi] Univ Memphis, Fogelman Coll Business & Econ, Dept Mkt & Supply Chain Management, Memphis, TN 38152 USA","Li, HT (corresponding author), Univ Missouri St Louis, Coll Business Adm, Dept Logist & Operat Management, St Louis, MO 63121 USA.",lihait@umsl.edu,,,,,,61,23,23,1,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

A number of studies have pointed out that a large portion of a new product's environmental quality (e. g. in compliance with RoHS) is determined at the beginning of the product development stage. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose, from a systematic point of view, several critical control processes applicable to the product development stage. Backcasting is applied for the process development. An internationally recognised quality management system, IECQ QC080000 HSPM, is referred to at the baseline step to help analyse a sustainability gap analysis of major flows. Unified Modeling Language sequence diagrams are further adopted to describe and specify the details of these processes.

Although considerable research has been conducted in logistics issues affecting HDRSCs, very little management research speaks to the complicating attributes. Thus, this article describes activities such as demand determination, supply chain coordination, recognizing when to move along the life cycle and post-disaster reconstruction that differentiates supply chain concerns from logistics concerns. From this backdrop, some of the areas where research into HDRSCs can inform supply chain management in general are presented. The article concludes by discussing critical areas of research need as identified by experienced practitioners.

The first objective function attempts to minimize sum of the expected value and the variability of total costs with reference to inventory levels, regular, overtime and subcontracting levels, backordering levels, and labor, machine and warehouse capacities. The second objective function highlighted the concept of customer service level through minimizing the expected value of maximum shortages among all customers' zones from which the variability of that is conducted. The last objective function aims to maximize workers productivity, a weighted average of productivity levels in all factories and in all periods which is weighted by the number of k-level labors. Then, we use an efficient algorithm that is a combination of an augmented e-constraint method and genetic algorithm to solve our proposed model.

Uncertainty of parameters in the proposed model is handled via an interval robust optimisation technique. The model assumptions are well matched with decision making environments of food and high-tech electronics manufacturing industries.

Design/methodology/approach - The study employed a survey method and data were collected from 250 companies in Taiwan's glass industry. Using structural equation modeling (SEM) technology, it specified the measurement properties of survey instrument such as reliabilities and validities and then identified causal relation among latent constructs to examine causal effects of hypotheses testing. Findings - The results show that a firm's agility capability and its network structure are a,critical competitive strategy source of firm performance. Moreover, network structure also partially mediates the impact of enterprise agility on firm performance. Research limitations/implications - Because the data were collected from a single industry and firm performance is evaluated by subjective managerial assessments, further research may be necessary by using the data involving multiple industries with objective performance indices for more meaningful and generalized results. Practical implications - The findings confirm the importance of enterprise agility for contemporary firms in today's dynamic business environment. By reinforcing enterprise agility, firms could react better to unpredictable changes. In addition, firms also are suggested to put more effort into developing and maintaining their network structures, both as repositories of external resources and as boosters of enterprise agility.

The physical approach to the topic draws on the concept of heterogenous interacting agents. The interaction among agents is considered as a repeated process of orders and production. The dynamics of production in the supply chain network which we observe is nonlinear due to the random failures in processes of orders and production. We introduce an agent-based model of a supply chain network which represents in more detail the real economic environment in which firms operate. We focus on the influence of local processes on the global economic behavior of the system and study how the proposed modifications change the general properties of the model. We observe collective bankruptcies of firms, which lead to self-emerging network structures. Our results give insight into the dynamics of default processes in supply chain networks, which have important implications both for risk managers and policy makers. Based on the simulations we show that agent-based modeling is a powerful tool for optimization of supply chain networks. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

E-business environments provide a facilitating infrastructure for solving the issues concerning the traditional supply chain, such as the scalability and flexibility for the efficient collaboration between partners. Both internal and external uncertainties to the supply chain can hinder collaboration between partners, and thus also hinder their ability to achieve their best possible performance. This research proposes using agent-based web services to better support collaboration within a supply chain. An advantage of agent-based web services is that they combine the strengths of both web services and multi-agents. Two different collaboration situations are used in order to demonstrate the flexibility of the system. Scalability is demonstrated when the supply chain faces changes in the partnership candidates. Simulation methods are used in order to validate the feasibility of this approach, and statistical tests reveal the robustness of the experimental results across diverse uncertainties.

The ERPII literature is then extended through interviews with potential players in ERPII implementations to identify the critical success factors (CSFs) or preconditions required for successful implementation throughout supply chains. These interviews were conducted with leading ERP vendors/consultants and organisations involved in the entire supply chain to gather evidence on the success, or lack thereof, of ERPII implementations. The results were compared and contrasted to existing literature on ERPII, collaborative networks, and the extended enterprise. We found more barriers to than drivers of successful ERPII implementation. This leads prospective implementers to have a pessimistic forecast for ERPII implementation success. Our research reveals that main reason for this negativity is a general lack of understanding and appreciation of the capabilities of the extended enterprise network. Second, the research presents two sets of CSFs: CSFs which apply to traditional ERP and carry forward to apply to ERPII, and CSFs that are tailored to the new needs for successful ERPII implementations. Finally, the research questions the suitability of ERPII in today's modern business environment, and suggests that technology may have overtaken management's capabilities to capture the full benefits of such an advanced enterprise system. Future trends in ERPII development are also considered in an attempt to find the next phase in the enterprise system life cycle. Beyond ERPII, the research suggests that infrastructure such as large-scale business intelligence (BI) systems must be heavily incorporated into modern enterprise systems to fully understand how information flows throughout an organisation and to make sense of that information.

Using systems theory and the resource-based view of the firm as the theoretical underpinnings, this study provides an in-depth systematic investigation of supply resiliency. Adopting a theory-building approach based on a multi-industry empirical investigation, this study derives empirical generalizations linking 19 supply chain characteristics to supply resiliency. The study culminates in a framework that could be used to assess the level of resiliency in a supply base. Building on this framework, the study also provides a supply resiliency matrix that can be utilized to classify supply chains, or supply chains segments according to the level of resiliency realized. This article concludes by proposing several future research directions and issues that may be investigated in more detail.","[Blackhurst, Jennifer] Iowa State Univ, Coll Business, Supply Chain & Informat Syst Dept, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Dunn, Kaitlin S.; Craighead, Christopher W.] Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Blackhurst, J (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Coll Business, Supply Chain & Informat Syst Dept, 3131 Gerdin Business Bldg, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",jvblackh@iastate.edu,"Wowak, Kaitlin/R-8496-2018; E G, KAVILAL/O-2779-2015","Wowak, Kaitlin/0000-0003-3149-152X; ",,,,92,187,189,12,102,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0735-3766,2158-1592,,J BUS LOGIST,J.

However, variations in the business environment can produce uncertainty and increase decision-making complexity for enterprises selecting from various supply chain information-sharing strategies. An effective and efficient supply chain strategy should be capable of reducing costs and raising customer-service levels, and should be capable of enhancing the robustness of the supply chain. In this study, the robustness of different supply chain strategies under various uncertain environments is studied using the simulated beer game. Techniques included Taguchi methodology and multiple criteria decision-making methods (MCDMs), including simple multiple attribute rating technology (SMART), technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), and grey relational analysis (GRA). The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio for each criterion is calculated to indicate the robustness of performance. This S/N ratio is used to determine an overall evaluation among various supply chain information-sharing strategies. The simulation results show that e-shopping has the most robust performance in uncertain environments. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Cultivation of the raw materials is closely related to the agricultural sector whereas the production of the final product presumes the operation of a conversion plant. The distribution network aims at delivering the final product close to the consumption. The extent of the involvement of each one of the previously mentioned sectors is the result of strategic and operational planning of the whole supply chain and, in the general case, determines the efficiency of the biofuels sector. Taking also into account the very rapidly changing opinions related to the environmental behaviour of the whole biofuels supply chain, it becomes very clear that the parameters in the sector are continuously changing. Therefore, the consideration of an integrated supply chain appropriately modelled is believed to be very critical and could result in the optimal solution per case, economically and/or environmentally speaking. In this paper the development of a mathematical model for the optimal design and operation of Biofuels Supply Chain is proposed as an integrated approach that can take into account both technical and economic parameters affecting the performance of the whole value chain. Model implementation would facilitate and support the decision taking in various planning and operational issues such as infrastructure investments, the quantities of raw materials to be cultivated, the quantities of biofuels to be produced in the domestic market or imported, identifying the best available solution for the optimal design and operation of the biofuels supply chain.

The eco-footprint comprises all kinds of environmental impact, but often is narrowed down to one aspect; e.g. the carbon footprint, material footprint, the water footprint, and so on. Although returns give rise to an additional goods flow from customers back to producers, it usually improves the eco-footprint due to the substitution effect. The reverse channel supplies high quality (recovered) products, components and materials to the forward channel thereby reducing the need for virgin sourcing and production. We refer to this as closed-loop recovery, as opposed to recovery for cascade markets which lacks substitution. To maximize substitution, the recovered items must re-enter the original supply chain. The feasibility of closed-loop recovery depends partly on the geographical proximity of forward and reverse facilities. We develop a decision framework for optimizing closed loop network configurations, i.e. the combined disposition and location-transport decision. We apply the framework to a single case study concerning one type of footprint (namely the carbon footprint) of a copier (closed-loop) supply chain. The main implication is that a regional network, with combined forward and reverse facilities per continent, proves most efficient and most robust in view of uncertain exogenous variables, but only when a full set of closed-loop options is available (including closed-loop recycling). As an embedded case, main contribution value of it lies in the discovery of a new phenomenon with generic implications; namely that not only the closed-loop supply chains footprint strongly depends on the substitution effect, but that in turn the feasibility of closed-loop recovery options depends heavily on the network design. From delineations of the study we derive issues for further research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The model aims to minimize total cost consisting expected value and variance of tactical cost (scheduling), strategic cost (employment of suppliers in supply chain network) to produce exceptional elements as well as the cost of resource underutilization. The model can give up a series of the solutions that are less sensitive to the changes in input data.

There is a concomitant need for foresight in describing supply chain performance in all operating environments, including those involving punctuated disruptions. Furthermore, the urban metropolis is now widely recognized to be an environment which is especially vulnerable to supply chain disruptions and for which integrated supply chain decisions can produce very substantial net benefits. Accordingly, this paper presents a dynamic supply chain network model formulated as a differential variational inequality; the model is fashioned to allow consideration of supply chain disruption threats to producers, freight carriers, and retail enterprises.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human activities have increased with industrial development and population expansion, and it is anticipated that resulting climate change might further limit agricultural productivity, through changes to weather patterns and global availability/distribution of agriculturally productive land. Growing crops as feedstocks for industrial uses is seen as one way of reducing GHG emissions and dependency on fossil resources. However, determining the extent to which the development of crops for industrial use will effect GHG balances and provide for a more energy efficient manufacturing system requires the development and use of appropriate calculation methodologies. Research at the Porter Institute has identified over 250 different scenarios for bioenergy production systems using commodity crops. In order to rationalise this complexity and diversity, a modular approach to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and sustainability analysis has been taken. This allows characterisation of discrete sections of supply chains and enables comparisons to be made between different crop production systems, different process systems and different end product uses. The purposes of this paper are to introduce the concepts of biofuel GHG and sustainability metrics, to introduce the approach taken by our organization and to use the example of UK grown willow in a lignocellulosic ethanol production system to demonstrate how GHG emission outcomes can be reviewed for new crops and technologies. The results show a range of variation, in both growing and process systems and how outcomes such as energy and GHG balances can be affected by various activities. LCA methodologies provide data to inform governments and industry of the potential specific supply chains may have for energy and GHG saving. However, methodological approaches can also affect assessment outcomes. Unresolved issues in LCA methodology must also be evaluated e.g. impacts resulting from land use change. Sustainability assessments of crop growing systems, irrespective of the end use, also assist in the assessment of environmental impacts of supply chains. However, it is critical that data continue to be collected, analysed and reviewed, to ensure that the most appropriate crops are grown and processed for the most appropriate end use.

We examined the capacity of traditional maize seed systems to provide these farmers with appropriate genetic material under predicted agro-ecological conditions associated with climate change. We studied the structure and spatial scope of seed systems of 20 communities in four transects across an altitudinal gradient from 10-2,980 m above sea level in five states of eastern Mexico. Results indicate that 90% of all of the seed lots are obtained within 10 km of a community and 87% within an altitudinal range of +/- 50 m but with variation across four agro-climate environments: wet lowland, dry lowland, wet upper midlatitude, and highlands. Climate models suggest a drying and warming trend for the entire study area during the main maize season, leading to substantial shifts in the spatial distribution patterns of agro-climate environments. For all communities except those in the highlands, predicted future maize environments already are represented within the 10-km radial zones, indicating that in the future farmers will have easy access to adapted planting material. Farmers in the highlands are the most vulnerable and probably will need to acquire seed from outside their traditional geographical ranges. This change in seed sources probably will entail important information costs and the development of new seed and associated social networks, including improved linkages between traditional and formal seed systems and more effective and efficient seed-supply chains.

Because the focus of management has shifted from a domestic to a more complex, three-dimensional network, it is critical for practitioners and researchers to understand how to optimize service based operant resources in the global marketplace. Practical Implications: Because the focus of management has shifted from a domestic to a more complex, three-dimensional global network, it is critical for practitioners and researchers to understand how to optimize service based operant resources in the global marketplace. We suggest that in this dynamic marketplace, both globalization and S-D logic are required to fully explain supply chain performance. Specifically, we suggest that managers develop a global 'supply-chain management' perspective allowing for the key operant resource - human capital - to create synergistic partner relationships and customer experiences resulting in superior performance. Originality/Value: This is one of the first (if not the first) paper that examines S-D logic in a global context. This move forward from the domestic orientation of many/most of the recent literature provides the foundation for future global research into the S-D logic.","[Richey, R.

Many manufacturers employ the JIT philosophy in order to be more competitive in today's global market. The success of JIT on the production floor has led many firms to expand the JIT philosophy to the entire supply chain. The procurement of parts and materials is a very important issue in the successful and effective implementation of JIT; thus, supplier selection and performance evaluation in long-term relationships have became more critical in JIT production environments. The proposed systems can assist manufacturers in handling these issues. In this research, neural network based supplier selection and supplier performance evaluation systems are presented. The proposed approach is not limited to JIT supply. It can assist manufacturers in selecting the most appropriate suppliers and in evaluating supplier performance. The proposed neural network based systems are tested with data taken from an automotive factory, and the results show that the proposed systems can be used effectively. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Industry-specific information regarding the structure and function of the beef value chain was gathered through interviews with industry leaders and experts; and specific consumer information was gathered through a consumer survey. The South African beef industry, like many other South African supply chains, is challenged by the increasing complexity and demand brought about by globalisation, increased volumes and competition, the shortage of skilled staff and pressures to meet changing customer needs. Consequently, the power has shifted from the supply side to the consumer.

Most of them are unconventional contingency events. Emergency relief is an important activity dealing with the disasters to transfer a large number of materials to the destroyed places for casualties and reconstruction for the country, even the world. Container multimodal transportation will play an important role because of its superior characteristics. The relations in the process of supply and transportation build up the container supply chain. It is critical to schedule the multimodal transportation flow of the chain with time efficiency of higher reliability. In this study, the system of container multimodal transportation emergency relief is modeled as an affinity network inspired by the immune system. An integer linear programming model is proposed to build the path selection for container supply chain in the context of emergency relief. The simulation study shows the promising effects of the model. The study is valuable for designing the emergency logistics management system with optimal path selection and flow design of container supply chain in disaster environments. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this environment, global companies have to scrutinize especially the role of major Asian economies (with large manufacturing capacities and huge markets), while conducting their strategic procurement planning. The developed model can be applied to a number of different scenario types encompassing various instances of disruptions to the collection of the end-of-life products, of the transportation system, and of the remanufacturing yield and capacity.

The computational methodology proposed here is systems perspective, integrative, and holistic approach for sustainability assessment which attempts to link basic science and technology to policy formulation. The framework adopts life cycle thinking methods-LCA, LCC, and SLCA; stakeholders analysis supported by multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA); and dynamic system modelling. Following Pareto principle, the critical sustainability criteria, indicators and metrics (i.e., hotspots) can be identified and further modelled using system dynamics or agent based modelling and improved by data envelopment analysis (DEA) and sustainability network theory (SNT).

Seeking to capitalize on the emergent ogreeno consumer, corporations are leading the next iteration in carbon footprinting: consumer products. This potentially lucrative low-carbon frontier, however, faces steep challenges due to complexities of scale, largely a function of the number of actors and geographies involved in globalized commodity and energy networks, and scope, which increasingly demands inclusion of emissions due to land use change (e.g., biofuel production, timber harvest, livestock grazing, mining). Life cycle assessment (LCA)the principal method behind product-level GHG emissions footprint protocolsfrequently avoids these challenges by narrowly delineating system boundaries, thereby excluding the omessinesso of space and place. Through a comparative model of energy sources and emissions in the globalized paper industry, this article reveals how complexities associated with geographic variation and land use change create indeterminacy in footprints based on these protocols. Using industry and trade data, the authors develop geographic information system transportation and energy models to map the globally dispersed pulp supply networks and to rescale Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change GHG inventory guidelines to include carbon loss associated with land use change in the carbon footprint of coated paper. Given their integrative abilities to conceptualize and model coupled human-ecological systems, sophisticated understanding of time-space dynamics and critical theoretical insights, geographers have much to contribute to the LCA and product carbon footprinting enterprise, which to date has been largely the intellectual domain of engineers.","[Newell, Joshua P.] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48106 USA; [Vos, Robert O.] Univ So Calif, Spatial Sci Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA","Newell, JP (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48106 USA.",jpnewell@umich.edu; vos@usc.edu,"Newell, Joshua P./J-6665-2016","Newell, Joshua P./0000-0002-1440-8715",,,,64,21,21,3,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0004-5608,1467-8306,,ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR,Ann.

Traditional managerial approaches, techniques and principles are no longer effective in dealing with these challenges. This article examines logistics and inventory problems in a supply chain operating in two countries where decisions have to be made with uncertain customer information. There are some differentials between two countries in terms of vehicle operation cost and capacity, labour cost, warehousing cost, etc. This article proposes three different types of robust models to integrate logistics and inventory processes between the two counties for coping with uncertain customer shipment information and the risk it entails. The first model is called the robust optimisation model with solution robustness, which provides an integrated logistics and inventory solution that is less sensitive to realisations of stochastic parameters. The second type of model is called the robust optimisation model with model robustness allowing late delivery (if it is profitable). The third type of model is called the robust optimisation model with trade-off between solution robustness and model robustness. It provides a direct way to measure the trade-off between risk and cost during the international transportation process. A series of experiments demonstrate that the proposed robust models can provide effective integrated logistics and inventory systems between two countries, which is important in today's highly competitive and dynamic business environment.","Univ Southampton, Sch Management, Management Sci Div, Southampton, Hants, England","Wu, Y (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Sch Management, Management Sci Div, Southampton, Hants, England.",y.wu@soton.ac.uk,,,,,,24,1,1,2,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0951-192X,1362-3052,,INT J COMPUT INTEG M,Int.

A bottom-up product-based life cycle assessment (LCA) approach was considered impractical to assess Knorr's portfolio's complexity. Thus, a meta-product-based accounting LCA approach was followed (MilA i Canals et al. 2009). Up to 16 product types or meta-products were assessed in each geographical region, with a total of 36 meta-products assessed globally. Then, the Knorr GHG footprint was derived by multiplying the impacts calculated per tonne of each product type with the sales volumes in 2007. Data for ingredients and processing technologies were gathered from the literature and suppliers; data from Knorr factories were used for the manufacturing stage. The variability in ingredients' production and processing and in manufacture was factored in and propagated through the calculations to assess the robustness of the results. The profiles of different meta-products within a product group (e.g. dry soups) follow similar patterns in terms of absolute GHG per tonne and distribution of such emissions along the life cycle. Variations are observed due to recipe composition and electricity mixes in the different regions. The range of variability around absolute results is significant and varies between meta-products. Aggregating the results for individual meta-products with their production volumes, the global Knorr brand GHG footprint in 2007 was estimated to be in the region of 3-5 million tonnes CO(2)e/annum (95% confidence interval). In spite of the significant variability ranges found, the results are useful for target setting and identification of opportunities for improvement. This is the world's first life cycle GHG assessment at brand's product portfolio level. The meta-product approach simultaneously allows for the assessment and comparison of individual product types as well as for the estimation of a brand's total GHG. The variability assessment enhanced robustness of the results by identifying a confidence range; given the complexity of the studied supply chains and the current data quality translated in wide confidence ranges, single number on-pack carbon labels seem questionable and not robust enough to inform consumers.","[Mila i Canals, Llorenc; Sim, Sarah; Garcia-Suarez, Tirma; Rigarlsford, Giles; King, Henry] Unilever R&D, SEAC, Sharnbrook MK44 1LQ, Beds, England; [Neuer, Gabriele; Herstein, Kathrin] Unilever R&D Heilbronn, Prod Dev Savoury, D-74074 Heilbronn, Germany; [Kerr, Colin] Unilever R&D Port Sunlight, Category Packaging, Wirral CH63 3JW, Merseyside, England","Canals, LMI (corresponding author), Unilever R&D, SEAC, Colworth Pk, Sharnbrook MK44 1LQ, Beds, England.",Llorenc.Mila-i-Canals@Unilever.com,,"Garcia-Suarez, Tirma/0000-0003-4808-2802",,,,17,23,24,0,30,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0948-3349,,,INT J LIFE CYCLE ASS,Int.

This paper explores the planning process for adaptation strategies, emphasizing current research and modelling constraints and comparing resilience strategies. The flood hazard, vulnerability and impact were assessed based on information provided by the Environment Agency, local knowledge and network modelling of outages. Improvements in flood estimation were suggested to extend the range of scenarios analysed and the geographic cover and scope of models, whilst reducing and quantifying associated uncertainty. For evaluating consequences of widespread flooding, information on joint flood probabilities would be relevant, particularly where sites are interconnected. Considering the uncertainties in the approach, two strategies were explored to manage the flood risk, i.e. enhanced asset and system resilience. Low-regret options designed to protect a site from flooding were chosen and, where the population at risk is high, those were complemented with long term strategies for increased robustness of supply network to a multiplicity of risks.","[Henriques, C.; Spraggs, G.] Anglian Water Serv, Cambridge CB4 0AP, England","Henriques, C (corresponding author), Anglian Water Serv, Milton House,Cowley Rd, Cambridge CB4 0AP, England.",catarina.c.henriques@gmail.com,"Henriques, Catarina/F-1223-2013","Henriques, Catarina/0000-0002-4607-4908",Environment Agency,The support and data provided by the Environment Agency is kindly acknowledged.

Recent world events have demonstrated how damage to one or more infrastructure components can result in disastrous political, social, and economic effects. This, in turn, has fostered the development of sophisticated quantitative methods that identify cost-effective ways of strengthening supply systems in the face of disruption. Stochastic and robust optimization can be used to tackle these strategic problems when uncertainty is present. The uncertainty dealt with in this article is related to the extent to which supply systems can be disrupted. More specifically, we propose and analyze different protection optimization models for minimizing the damage to a system resulting from the disruption of an uncertain number of system components. We compare a cost-based model and two original regret models that, to the best of our knowledge, represent the state of the art in the field of protection in location analysis. Also, we discuss how to build an operational envelope for the models considered, which can be used to identify the range of possible impacts associated with different protection strategies. The models are tested on a benchmark data set and on a new data set that was built using the Census 2001 data of the United Kingdom. We analyze and compare the protection plans generated by the models and provide some useful insights related to the robustness of the different modeling approaches.","[Liberatore, Federico; Scaparra, Maria Paola] Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury CT2 7PE, Kent, England","Liberatore, F (corresponding author), Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury CT2 7PE, Kent, England.",fl51@kent.ac.uk; m.p.scaparra@kent.ac.uk,"Scaparra, Maria/AAC-1781-2020","Scaparra, Maria/0000-0002-2725-5439; LIBERATORE, FEDERICO/0000-0001-9900-5108",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/E048552/1] Funding Source: researchfish,,,66,13,13,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0004-5608,1467-8306,,ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR,Ann.

Simulations were modelled using a novel agent-based methodology combined with a robust experimental design approach and an industrial data set obtained from two companies in Eastern Canada. Experimental results provide insights about the dynamic relations among factors related to control levels, planning methods and planning horizon lengths. Results indicate that supply chain control levels play a relevant role in defining robust service levels, while the planning horizon and the planning method have lower impact in this context. In addition, from the supply chain inventory level point of view, we verified that the three investigated tactical rules have to be configured together if one desires to maximise their contribution for a robust supply chain system capable of coping with uncertainties from the business environment. When these rules are evaluated individually, it is not possible to make the most of their potential due to interactions between them. The article concludes by proposing an optimum robust configuration of the tactical rules to minimise the impact of supply chain uncertainties.","[Santa-Eulalia, L.

Thus, to stay competitive, companies rely on sophisticated information systems and logistic skills, and especially accurate and reliable forecasting systems. However, forecasters have to deal with some singular constraints of the textile-apparel market such as for instance the volatile demand, the strong seasonality of sales, the wide number of items with short life cycle or the lack of historical data. To respond to these constraints, companies have implemented specific forecasting systems often simple but robust. After the study of existing practices in the clothing industry, we propose different forecasting models which perform more accurate and more reliable sales forecasts. These models rely on advanced methods such as fuzzy logic, neural networks and data mining. In order to evaluate the benefits of these methods for the supply chain and more especially for the reduction of the bullwhip effect, a simulation based on real data of sourcing and forecasting processes is performed and analyzed.

Many enterprises pay close attention to successful delivery of their freight. Hence, how to determine the optimal carrier selection is a very critical issue for global enterprises. Generally, there are several carriers to serve on each route connecting two cities (or transfer stations) in the logistics network. Each carrier owns multiple available capacities with a probability distribution because the carrier's capacity may be partially reserved for other orders. A carrier selection means selecting exact one carrier on each route, and the logistics network according to the carrier selection is thus a stochastic logistic network. The network reliability is a performance index of freight delivery for supply chain management and is defined as the probability that d units of commodity are successfully transmitted from a supplier to a customer. This study focuses on the optimal carrier selection problem based on network reliability criterion. A GA-based algorithm that combines the minimal paths and the recursive sum of disjoint products is developed to determine the optimal carrier selection with the maximal network reliability. A practical logistics example of the LCD monitors delivery from Asia to Europe is presented to illustrate the solution procedure. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The IIM for supply chain networks has been proposed, based on the original IIM used in macro-economics. A new method called the OWA (Ordered Weighted Averaging) Operator has been formulated to evaluate the interdependency matrix, a key component of the IIM. Similar to the capability of the basic IIM to describe the propagation impacts of disruptions to macroeconomic systems, the IIM for supply chain networks is capable of describing the propagation effects of disruptions to interdependent supply chain components. IIM assesses the impacts of disruptions to supply chain networks with inoperability and economic losses metrics, which can provide helpful insights for risk management of supply chain networks. An example supply chain network is used to illustrate the application of IIM for systemic risk assessment of supply chains under an unsafe environment. A risk mitigation strategy by increasing the number of suppliers has been considered to reduce the adverse effects caused by the supply reduction of the single secondary supplier in the example supply chain network. In addition, a simulation model integrated with Monte Carlo simulation method has been developed to validate the accuracy of the IIM for supply chain. The example shows that the application of IIM can provide useful guidance toward supply chain risk management or mitigation strategies and it could also be used to test the effectiveness of these strategies.

However, our tools are still insufficient to perform the sustainable product-process synthesis integrally across the whole chemical supply chain. The ongoing development of concepts, methods and computer applications thus remains the most important role of the PSE community in order to provide engineers with powerful systems tools with which to shape sustainable development. The task, however, is very challenging even at the level of process synthesis since we are dealing with multi-criteria, an enormous amount of complex interactions, uncertainties, discrete and continuous decisions, giving rise to the use of the simultaneous, mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) approach. Although several efficient MINLP solvers have been developed in the last two decades, hardly any academic or professional MINLP synthesizer for solving such nontrivial synthesis problems has been developed so far. The present contribution wishes to shed light on some important issues relating to different challenges that had to and still have to be mastered as well as various capabilities which in turn were rewarded by mastering some of the challenges during the development of the advanced mixed-integer process synthesizer (MipSyn), the successor of the process synthesizer PROSYN-MINLP (Kravanja & Grossmann, 1990, 1994).

In this context, waste biomass utilization has emerged as a viable alternative for energy production, encompassing a wide range of potential thermochemical, physicochemical and bio-chemical processes. Two significant bottlenecks that hinder the increased biomass utilization for energy production are the cost and complexity of its logistics operations. In this manuscript, we present a critical synthesis of the relative state-of-the-art literature as this applies to all stakeholders involved in the design and management of waste biomass supply chains (WBSCs). We begin by presenting the generic system components and then the unique characteristics of WBSCs that differentiate them from traditional supply chains. We proceed by discussing state-of-the-art energy conversion technologies along with the resulting classification of all relevant literature. We then recognize the natural hierarchy of the decision-making process for the design and planning of WBSCs and provide a taxonomy of all research efforts as these are mapped on the relevant strategic, tactical and operational levels of the hierarchy. Our critical synthesis demonstrates that biomass-to-energy production is a rapidly evolving research field focusing mainly on biomass-to-energy production technologies. However, very few studies address the critical supply chain management issues, and the ones that do that, focus mainly on (i) the assessment of the potential biomass and (ii) the allocation of biomass collection sites and energy production facilities. Our analysis further allows for the identification of gaps and overlaps in the existing literature, as well as of critical future research areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet interdependence requires coordination among functions, sites, and stages of the internal supply chain (SC). Drawing on a case study of a large European pharmaceutical company, which we call Tyrenco, we explore how HR practices evolve within the strategic intra-firm supply relationship. Our findings illustrate the disruptive effects of HR practices when they are focused on site-based objectives and the improved coordination that results from redesigning HR processes to achieve internal operational integration. We highlight the tension between site-based, financial controls and an emergent SC logic. Drawing on recent interest in cooperative approaches to HR practices, this study seeks to operationalize the need to align HR practices with end-to-end objectives at different stages of the intra-firm supply chain. Our findings have practical implications for designing HR practices within multinational corporations (MNCs) that are characterized by complex and fragmented internal environments.

One objective is to stimulate high-level recovery, and the other is to introduce life cycle thinking. This paper studies decision making in recovery, comparing opportunistic decision making with short-term profit maximization (usually leading to one loop) versus a life-cycle perspective (leading to multiple loops). The question is (1) which business benefits this brings as well as reduction of environmental impact and (2) whether companies should be inclined to think multi-loop and if so how governments could stimulate this. After comparing the problem with the literature, a non-linear optimization model is presented optimizing NPV of revenues and calculating environmental impact with cumulative energy demand and cumulative recovery rates. The environmental indicators chosen are motivated based on literature research in the area of streamlined LCA. Sensitivity analysis tests solutions on various sources of uncertainty. We study a real-life case with real data. Based on the results, we can formulate the following insights for industry. Firstly, cascade markets for reuse may appear attractive but new sales cannibalization compromised margins. To neutralize this effect, returns should be remanufactured to equal-to-new quality hence no difference should exist between new and recovered items. Companies must suppress their natural instincts of maximizing short-term profits and delay some of the revenues by implementing multi-loop models in order to maximize total life-cycle profit. Environmental impact improves as well according to both indicators. Feasibility of returns should be maximized which for example implies careful collection and storage of wrecks, preventing damage and corrosion, etc. Product design changes may further enhance feasibility. However, the concept requires that all loops are controlled well by one actor. For governments the following advices apply. As mentioned, most EPR-based systems in place today maximize single loop 3. Using alternative steering principles instead of target quota on recovery and collection could stimulate multi-loop solutions that prove more robust, more profitable, and have better footprint. It is concluded that multi-loop recovery is preferred both economically and environmentally. But both industry and governments must improve their policies. Therefore, future research is mapped based on handles and delineations of the study.","Tilburg Univ, CentER, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands","Krikke, H (corresponding author), Tilburg Univ, CentER, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",krikke@uvt.nl,,,,,,35,15,16,0,24,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0948-3349,,,INT J LIFE CYCLE ASS,Int.

It is called ANN-MADA hybrid method. ANN-MADA hybrid method considers both practicality in traditional supplier selection criteria and environmental regulations. It also overcomes traditional DEA drawbacks, limitations of data accuracy and decision-making units (DMUs) amounts constraint. The model evaluation results of an international well-known camera manufacturer indicate that the ANN-MADA hybrid method outperforms two other hybrid methods, ANN-DEA and ANP-DEA.

These multiagent systems reflect the trends of modern information systems and the argument made here can serve as a guide to designing robust multiagent systems. The argument is that fairness leads to stability and consequently optimality. The fairness is allocating resources according to the utilities achievable by individual agents. On the other hand, unfairness arises when resources are allocated strictly equally or as reserved beforehand. The source of instability is identified as excess resources resulting from the unfairness. Since excess resources of some agents can be utilized by others, a system becomes vulnerable to instability due to the interactions from resource sharing. The fairness eliminates excess resources and agents become securing definite valuations of resources, as a result of utility-maximizing behaviors. As a consequence, the system reaches an optimal equilibrium voluntarily after any perturbation. Note to Practitioners-Multiagent system designers must understand the collective behavior resulting from the interactions between agents in order to build robust systems. For this purpose, there have been efforts to provide appropriate arguments of stability depending on the nature of system. For example, agent diversity was identified as a key to stabilizing computational ecosystem model and information sharing to supply chain networks. This paper drives an argument of stability for the multiagent systems characterized by resource sharing and algorithms selection. Individual systems are increasingly sharing resources and software systems are becoming capable of adapting to environmental changes through alternative algorithms. The argument is that fairness in such multiagent systems leads to stability and consequently optimality. However, despite of pursuing fairness, there can be diverse obstacles that give rise to unfairness. These obstacles are the limitations of the argument made and, hence, it is needed to extend the argument with respect to these limitations in future research.","Purdue Univ, Sch Ind Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Lee, S (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Sch Ind Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",stonesky@purdue.edu,,,,,,53,3,3,0,5,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1545-5955,1558-3783,,IEEE T AUTOM SCI ENG,IEEE Trans.

An integrated optimization model for production and distribution planning is proposed, with the aimed of optimally coordinating important and interrelated logistics decisions. However, a real supply chain operates in a highly dynamic and uncertain environment. Therefore, this model is transformed into fuzzy models taking into account the fuzziness in the capacity constraints, and the aspiration level of costs using different aggregation operators.

We take a critical stock take of such applications to date, and reflect on their contribution to value chain sustainability and resilience. The stock take shows that the rate of industry or policy adoption has been limited, partly due to the complex interactions across the segments of agricultural value chains, and the mathematical representation being different to the way the decision maker understands the problem. OR practice in agriculture is also being asked to cover greater spatial scales and engage more stakeholders, and is required to embrace resilience and sustainability objectives. A single-minded focus on optimizing parts of these complex systems without considering the whole system is no longer adequate, and new methods and approaches are required. Complex systems science methods are being applied to analyse the dynamics of complex social-ecological systems, and are starting to find a home in industrial supply chain analysis. We demonstrate how three complex system methods, agent-based modelling, dynamical systems modelling and network analysis, can be applied to agricultural value chains as a means of gaining insights into system dynamics under different and dynamic conditions. The relevance and utility of OR in ensuring the success of agricultural value chains into the future will require practitioners to understand and model value chains as complex adaptive systems.","[Higgins, A.

GIs are unique, in that they provide a means of ensuring that control over production and sales of a product stays within a local area, but at the same time they make use of extralocal markets. Although control over GIs largely rests with local actors, GIs are nested in wider regional, national, and international networks; and the passage from local to extralocal markets introduces new costs and benefits and new relations of power into the supply chain. The degree to which GI protection spurs development and protects local environmental and cultural resources depends on the structure of the GI legislation and on the territorial context in which protection is embedded. Using a commodity-chains approach, I compare two GI production systems, tequila in Mexico and Comte cheese in France, in order to develop a theory of the factors that contribute to more sustainable, equitable GI production systems. I argue that three key differences in the design of the GI schemes help to explain the varying effects of the two cases: (1) the manner in which supply-chain actors define quality, (2) the way that the GI valorizes the terroir of the region, and (3) the strength and cohesion that the collective organizing body exhibits. Moreover, the institutional and political context in which GI supply chains touch down plays a critical role. Contrary to a conceptualization of GIs as compatible with a purely market-oriented model, my comparison of these two cases indicates that some level of state involvement, in order to level the playing field and empower small farmers, is a necessary, although not sufficient, precondition for successful and sustainable GIs.","N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Bowen, S (corresponding author), N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",,,,,,,109,89,92,7,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-0112,1549-0831,,RURAL SOCIOL,Rural Sociol.,JUN,2010,75,2,,,,,209,243,,10.1111/j.1549-0831.2009.00007.x,,,35,Sociology,Sociology,606CH,WOS:000278398000002,,,,,2021-03-04

The surveyable number of delegates and conference rooms, in combination with the well-balanced scientific and social program, facilitated optimal professional exchange and discussion. Conference structure: LCM 2009 featured some 140 contributions from 47 leading environmental practitioners, consultants, and academic researchers. The interactive conference format included three plenary sessions and training workshops. LCM 2009 successfully engaged with the critical questions of what it means to manage (not merely shift) the environmental and social impacts of global economic activity, what this entails for industry and public services in emerging economies, and how supply chains, networks, and partnerships can be stimulated and managed to deliver truly sustainable practice.","[Curran, Mary Ann] US EPA, Cincinnati, OH 45268 USA; [Potting, Jose] Wageningen Univ, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [von Blottnitz, Harro] Univ Cape Town, Dept Chem Engn, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa","Curran, MA (corresponding author), US EPA, Cincinnati, OH 45268 USA.",jose.potting@wur.nl; curran.maryann@epa.gov; Harro.VonBlottnitz@uct.ac.za,"Potting, Jose/AAT-6932-2020","Curran, Mary Ann/0000-0001-8565-9928",,,,4,3,5,0,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0948-3349,1614-7502,,INT J LIFE CYCLE ASS,Int.

Andrew",,,Perspectives on achieving sustainable energy production and use,JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,BIOFUELS,"The traditional definition of sustainability calls for policies and strategies that meet society's present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Through the 1970 National Environmental Policy Act, U. S. policy formally established the goal of creating and maintaining conditions under which [humans] and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans. However, we have not yet succeeded in making sustainability operational. The long-standing and current debates on setting energy policy, regulating greenhouse gases, and promoting alternate fuels illustrate the complexity of making sustainability operational. Achieving operational sustainability requires three critical elements: advances in science and technology, application of effective government regulations and policies, and green business practices. Not only are these elements necessary, all three must work together across the economy. A key lesson drawn from the history of environmental regulation and especially in the climate debate is that sustainability cannot be advanced without a convergence of government and business interests even when the requisite technology is available. The biofuel system presents an immediate and tangible test case for the successful interaction of these three critical elements. The massive investments in science and technology by both government and industry to develop new feedstocks and conversion methods are showing promise. From a regulatory perspective, existing statutes and new mandates impact all parts of the biofuel supply chain-a complex system involving feedstocks, conversion technologies, transport, storage, handling, and end use. Forward-looking businesses in the biofuel sector are integrating sustainability objectives into their business strategies, such as designing feedstock conversion processes to generate biofuel coproducts that can add substantial revenue. The combination and coordination of such activities have the potential to achieve sustainable biofuel production and to demonstrate the kind of critical approaches that are essential to making sustainability operational in this and other energy sectors.

To meet increasing demands of consumers, government and business partners, enterprises continuously have to work on innovations of products, processes and ways of cooperation in agri-food supply chain networks (AFSCN). Hence, a development towards a more knowledge-based economy is needed. The Lisbon strategy, launched by the European Union, to attain this knowledge-based economy, has failed so far. This paper argues that information sharing and organizing ICT are main critical areas to overcome this deadlock. However, ICT development in AFSCN involves an information integration task that has to deal with technical and organizational requirements and starts with an existing installed base. Traditional software engineering approaches are inadequate to address these issues. This paper provides an overall method for analysis, design and implementation of information integration, taking technical as well as organizational development into account. The method was derived from experiences in a research and development program in the Dutch arable farming sector. A generic integration framework forms the backbone of the method to ensure systematic and sustainable ICT development. Business process management (BPM), in combination with reference information models, plays an important role. The technical architecture and infrastructure are based on a service-oriented architecture (SOA). Attention is paid to the organizational infrastructure that is needed to embed the results in the right context, so that they will be broadly supported and used. The method is divided into three phases: analysis, basic design and iterative implementation. Analysis of the current situation in AFSCN is supported by an information integration framework. The basic design is a first version of the generic integration framework. In the iterative implementation phase, pilot projects are guided by this basic design, which results in incremental growth of the framework. The pilot projects follow a Living Lab (LL) approach. LLs represent a user-centric, open innovation approach for sensing, prototyping, validating and refining complex solutions in multiple and evolving real life contexts. The method is illustrated by an application to the Dutch arable farming sector. It can be concluded that the contribution of the presented method lies in combining different methodologies into a design approach for information integration, based on a sound architecture. The presented method leads to ICT that follows the business processes in real life and thus enhances appropriate information sharing to support a knowledge-based economy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

One sensible definition of an 'extreme' event would be one that led to some qualitative, structural change in the system, as it went beyond the current 'control limits' of the system. Indeed, we can view any current structure and organization that characterize a system as being forged out of the past events and crises that led to change and innovation. Each individual, group, firm, corporation, shareholder and observer experience 'pathdependent learning', whereby current learning is conditional by the events and decisions taken in the past. In reality, the 'new' system or structure that comes into being at a given time, although initially seen as a successful response to some past problem, will move into an unknowable future that will necessarily end in some new crisis, the emergence of some unexpected new factors, effects or implications that will have to be dealt with. A simple probabilistic model of event dynamics is presented showing that the discussions of power laws and self-organized criticality assume a stationary situation and the probability of given events. We contrast this with examples from human systems that are about qualitative, structural change and path-dependent learning. The first example involves the handling of severe motorway traffic accidents and the second describes the evolution of supply chains by trial and error, as new practices are adopted or rejected in a changing competitive economic environment. Social and economic systems must evolve, and will do so through the occurrence of seemingly 'extreme' events, requiring adaptation and change. The important lesson therefore is to accept that there will be always a potential for unexpected and surprising events and that we need to build systems that are robust and resilient to their occurrence.

Transformation in electric energy is one of its applications which attracts considerable interest, owing to the fact that it makes it possible to solve a major problem in isolated cities that lack electrical supply networks. For solar energy use, the current drawback remains its high cost. This problem can be resolved through different improvements in terms of power production. For that, different axis of research can be explored [1-.3]. Over the past few years, solar cells arrays (SCA) have been connected to various loads in a direct coupled method. A PV module can produce the power at a point, called an operating point, anywhere on the current-voltage (I-V) curve. The coordinates of the Operating point are the operating voltage and current. There is a unique point near the knee of the I-V curve, called a maximum power point (MPP), at which the module operates with the maximum efficiency and produces the maximum output power. The point of maximum power is the desired operating point for a PV array to obtain maximum efficiency. A PV array is usually oversized to compensate for a low power yield during winter months. This mismatching between a PV module and a load requires further over-sizing of the PV array and thus increases the overall system cost [3-5]. To mitigate this problem, different methods have been developed [6-12]. A maximum power point tracker (MPPT) can be used to maintain the PV module's operating point at the MPP. The system in a direct coupled method cannot always operate at maximum power point (MPP) of the solar array when the load, irradiance or temperature changes. A PV-load coupling system should be able to maximize the energy output of the PV generator, which should operate always at its maximum power point (MPP) in order to achieve maximum global efficiency. Some authors have supported the direct coupling between the PV generator and the load [2-3]. Several methods and algorithms to track the maximum power point have been developed [2-12]. We focused our effort on improving the matching between PV sources and loads through the development of new performing methods. In this paper, a rapid approach for peak power tracking is proposed. The system PV generator - load is optimized, when the working point in direct coupling is quite near the MPP of the PV generator, so that the global efficiency of the system is acceptable. Another method is proposed. It is based on reconfiguring on-line the SCA by changing the connections between different modules in order to minimize the losses due to load and operation conditions. Two strategies for improvements are chosen for testing in this study, whatever the loads and operating conditions. The experimental system used a microcontroller. It is robust when undergoing environment changes and load variations. The performance of the methods is verified through simulations and experiments.","[Zerhouni, Fatima Zohra; Zerhouni, M'hamed Houari; Zegrar, Mansour; Benmessaoud, M.

Through analysis of the emergence of triplex-network in supply chains, triplex-network-based evaluation model of SCR was proposed and a numerical example was provided. The dynamic interactions of various entities involved in a supply chain lead to their relation emerging as interactive triplex-network in higher level and further lead to the supply chain emerging as a complex societal-techno interactive system in even higher level. Therefore, hierarchical conceptual architecture and triplex-network analysis are significant for the development of SCR theory. SCR was considered as a unification of fuzzy and random meaning in dynamic environment in this paper. Furthermore, intrinsic relationship between the theoretical foundation of SCR evaluation and the cloud theory was discovered and accordingly, cloud theory is applied to study the evaluation of SCR. Multi-disciplinary meta-synthesis research method presented in this paper will bring inspiration to multi-disciplinary reliability-related researches. This work contributed to the understanding and evaluation of SCR and has important implication as for the need to incorporate various entities and networks into the collaborative management process of supply chains to reduce disruption risks. This work will provide valuable insight to academicians and business professionals.","[Miao, Xin; Xi, Bao; Yu, Bo] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China","Miao, X (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.",miaoxin@yahoo.cn,,,,,,25,1,1,1,5,ACADEMIC JOURNALS,VICTORIA ISLAND,"P O BOX 5170-00200 NAIROBI, VICTORIA ISLAND, LAGOS 73023, NIGERIA",1993-8233,,,AFR J BUS MANAGE,Afr.
