The two-step optimization framework starts with a Fuzzy Inference System methodology for scenario generation that faces the lack of information, and the necessity of estimate the expected operation cost and environmental impact. Then we use generated scenarios into the epsilon-constraint method which solves a multi-objective model to obtain a relevant set of solutions. After solving the second optimization model, we propose to analyze the robustness of the achieved redesign solutions considering a customer satisfaction approach. The computational experiments show that our proposed framework supports better the inclusion of scenarios for redesigning the plastic recycling supply chain. Furthermore, we study a real-life plastic recycling problem in Cuba which demonstrates that the framework is able to support the redesign decision making with robust solutions sensitive to the changes of the studied uncertain parameters.","[Feito-Cespon, Michael] Univ Cienfuegos, Dept Ind Engn, Cienfuegos, Cuba; [Costa, Yasel] Zaragoza Logist Ctr, MIT Zaragoza Int Logist Program, Zaragoza, Spain; [Pishvaee, Mir Saman] Iran Univ Sci & Engn, Sch Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Cespon-Castro, Roberto] Univ Cent Marta Abreu Las Villas, Dept Ind Engn, Santa Clara, Cuba","Costa, Y (corresponding author), Zaragoza Logist Ctr, MIT Zaragoza Int Logist Program, Zaragoza, Spain.",mfeito@ucf.edu.cu; ycosta@zlc.edu.es; pishvaee@iust.ac.ir; rcespon@uclv.edu.cu,"Pishvaee, Mir Saman/H-3450-2018","Pishvaee, Mir Saman/0000-0001-6389-6308; Costa, Yasel/0000-0002-2840-2082",,,,79,0,0,10,10,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0957-4174,1873-6793,,EXPERT SYST APPL,Expert Syst.

Design/methodology/approach An exploratory research design, which adopted a qualitative approach was used to achieve the study's research objective. Qualitative data were gathered through 23 semi-structured interviews with key supply chain actors across the PSC in the UK. Findings The findings demonstrate that CAS, as a theory, provides a systemic approach to understanding PSC resilience by taking into consideration the various elements (environment, PSC characteristics, vulnerabilities and resilience strategies) that make up the entire system. It also provides explanations for key findings, such as the impact of power, conflict and complexity in the PSC, which are influenced by the interactions between supply chain actors and as such increase its susceptibility to the negative impact of disruption. Furthermore, the antecedents for building resilience strategies were the outcome of the decision-making process referred to as co-evolution from a CAS perspective. Originality/value Based on the data collected, the study was able to reflect on the relationships, interactions and interfaces between actors in the PSC using the CAS theory, which supports the proposition that resilience strategies can be adopted by supply chain actors to enhance this service supply chain. This is a novel empirical study of resilience across multiple levels of the PSC and as such adds valuable new knowledge about the phenomenon and the use of CAS theory as a vehicle for exploration and knowledge construction in other supply chains.","[Yaroson, Emilia Vann; Hou, Jiachen] Univ Bradford, Sch Management, Bradford, W Yorkshire, England; [Breen, Liz; Sowter, Julie] Univ Bradford, Sch Pharm & Med Sci, Bradford, W Yorkshire, England","Yaroson, EV (corresponding author), Univ Bradford, Sch Management, Bradford, W Yorkshire, England.",e.v.yaroson@bradford.ac.uk,,,,,,130,0,0,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1359-8546,1758-6852,,SUPPLY CHAIN MANAG,Supply Chain Manag.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1108/SCM-05-2019-0184,,FEB 2021,18,Business; Management,Business & Economics,QF5ZQ,WOS:000616972900001,,,,,2021-03-04

Academics and practitioners need to simultaneously incorporate resilience and greenness perspectives in planning approaches since this context has not been investigated in the existing literature. At the tactical level, it requires advanced modelling and solution approaches. In this research, a novel bi-objective stochastic model is developed to cover specific characteristics of meat inventory planning in a three-echelon network. Two resiliency strategies are embedded in the model to hedge against the disruptions. Disruptions behavior in the food context is characterized to illustrate real-world situations as stochastic processes using the Monte-Carlo method. To solve the model, sample average approximation and Lexicographic Weighted Tchebycheff methods are derived. Numerous problem instances are conducted to validate the applicability of the proposed model and solution approach. The results reiterate that resilient solutions could retain the network performance and even increase it by 6%. It is also concluded that solutions are sensitive to the throughput capacity and lead-time by 13% and 41%, respectively.

Since its major producer-exporter countries are limited, paying attention to its supply chain seems quite necessary. The pistachio SC management can play an important role in its more economic development because it involves all the activities related to the product management from supply to the customer delivery. Also, due to the recently changing environmental regulations affecting manufacturing operations, increasing attention is given to developing environmental commitments for the supply chain.

That being the case, in this study, a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer optimization model is proposed to design an RSC network under uncertainty sourcing from the ripple effect (i.e. external side of RSC) by considering the environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability. The environmental and economic disruptions of the ripple effect are represented by the increase in the carbon emission levels and the distance of roads, and the decrease in the capacity of facilities, respectively. Accordingly, a set of scenarios is considered based on the disruption levels (low- and high-impact) in case of the ripple effect. Furthermore, an alpha-reliability constraint is integrated into the model to further analyze the occurrence of scenarios. The model allows us to make integrated operational and strategic decisions by placing an emphasis on the carbon emission levels (i.e. environmental dimension) and the total cost (i.e. economic dimension). To obtain some remarkable insights, the proposed model is validated through computational experiments based on data extracted from a real case. The computational results show that the ripple effect increases the emission level and total cost up to 40%. For this reason, it suggested that the regulations regarding WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) should be prepared by considering sustainability in the entire RSC network. Besides, it is realized that the centralized distribution strategy leads to a more resilient RSC network design. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, a sustainable two-phase sequential approach is proposed for the design of bioenergy SCs under uncertainties. The first phase, integrating geographical information, social aspects, and multi-criteria decision-making techniques, helps find appropriate locations for the bio-refineries. High rates of unemployment, and high vulnerability to the variation in the markets in an economic crisis are considered as social concerns. Integrating these factors filters the areas for the second phase. The first phase reduces complexity in the computation of the problem, and helps set up sustainable development in the supply chain. In the second phase, to cope with the uncertainties in the bioenergy supply network, a robust model is introduced. It reduces the sensitivity to inaccurate input data, and the obtained solutions stay optimal when the parameters change slightly. In order to validate this two-phase sequential approach, a case study is investigated. The results of tests show that integrating the concepts of uncertainties and sustainability with geographical information of the area in a two-phase sequential approach outperforms the traditional models, and leads to the creation of 262 jobs. The jobs have a high impact on the surrounding area. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper describes a multi-stage network-based model to minimize the overall cost for the reverse logistics management of inert construction waste across its entire life cycle. This model takes a unique two-type costing approach to overcome the ambiguities and deficiencies existing in previous models. Type-I cost refers to the facility-based costing (FBC) and Type-II cost refers to non-facility based costing (NFBC). The mixed-integer linear programming technique is applied using the LINGO software. A case study of construction waste management in Hong Kong is conducted to validate the developed model, which includes waste generation point as the starting node, public fill reception facility and recycling facility as an intermediate node, and landfill as an ending node. The result shows about 24% reduction in the total cost compared to the base case. Furthermore, to evaluate the impact of uncertainties on the cost parameters, a detailed scenario based sensitivity analysis is conducted. The optimal result shows that the larger portion of total cost come from the NFBC component. Therefore, NFBC is critical in defining the overall reverse logistics network and thus, should be given more emphasis in the design of an effective construction waste management system.

Moreover, increasing producer responsibility, informal recycling practices and disposal issues have given attention to adopt mitigation strategies for successful implementation of e-waste management system. This study acknowledges the critical strategies to recover resources along with processing and treatment of toxic and hazardous component of e-waste mitigation and management which is immediate and existing challenge for India. A combined framework based on Grey concept and DEMATEL technique has been proposed in this work to determine the interdependence among the e-waste mitigation strategies (MS) by cause/effect analysis. This study has revealed that 'top management initiation and commitment towards return management' is the most imperative and driving strategy in the e-waste management and control. It also influences the other existing strategies. This work has also highlighted that e-waste mitigation can be effective if it concentrates on effective implementation of e-waste policy, directives and regulations such as extended producer responsibility (EPR), advance recycling fee (ARF) etc., technological and green innovations in recycling network and strategic alliance among supply chain partners and e-waste recyclers (in-house and outsource service provider) in Indian scenario in the management of e-waste issues. The cause-effect relationships are helpful to the managers, Government agencies and policy makers to learn crucial causal strategies that require imperative emphasis in dealing with e-waste issues in India.

It has been revealed in the analysis of previous reviews that there is a need for a more comprehensive analysis of the resource and environmental impact contributions by industrial and urban processes, as well as product supply chains. The review discusses the recent key developments in the areas of Process Integration and Optimisation, the assessment and reduction of process environmental impacts, waste management and integration, green technologies. That is accompanied by a review of the papers in the current Virtual Special Issue of the Journal of Cleaner Production which is dedicated to the extended articles developed on the basis of the papers presented at the 22nd Conference on Process Integration for Energy Saving and Pollution Reduction. The follow-up analysis reveals significant advances in the efficiency and emission cleaning effects of key processes, as well as water/wastewater management and energy storage. The further analysis of the developments identifies several key areas for further research and development - including increases of the safety and robustness of supply networks for products and services, increase of the resources use efficiency of core production and resource conversion processes, as well as the emphasis on improved product and process design for minimising product wastage.

Despite past and ongoing efforts, the available methods often overlook impacts beyond climate change or incorporate them via standard life cycle assessment metrics that are hard to interpret from an absolute sustainability viewpoint. We here address the design of biomass supply chains considering critical ecological limits of the Earth-planetary boundaries-which should never be surpassed by anthropogenic activities. Our method relies on a mixed-integer linear program that incorporates a planetary boundaries-based damage model to quantify absolute sustainability precisely. We apply this approach to the sugarcane-to-ethanol industry in Argentina, identifying the optimal combination of technologies and network layout that minimize the impact on these ecological boundaries. Our framework can find applications in a wide range of supply chain problems related to chemicals and fuels production, energy systems, and agriculture planning.","[Wheeler, Jonathan; Mele, Fernando D.] Univ Nacl Tucuman, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Tecnol, Dept Ingn Proc & Gest Ind, San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina; [Wheeler, Jonathan; Mele, Fernando D.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, CCT NOA Sur, San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina; [Galan-Martin, Angel; Guillen-Gosalbez, Gonzalo] Inst Chem & Bioengn, Dept Chem & Appl Biosci, Zurich, Switzerland","Mele, FD (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Tucuman, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Tecnol, Dept Ingn Proc & Gest Ind, San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina.; Guillen-Gosalbez, G (corresponding author), Inst Chem & Bioengn, Dept Chem & Appl Biosci, Zurich, Switzerland.",fmele@herrera.unt.edu.ar; gonzalo.guillen.gosalbez@chem.ethz.ch,,,Universidad Nacional de Tucuman [26/E-647]; CONICET (Argentine Scientific and Technical Research Council),To Universidad Nacional de Tucuman (Project 26/E-647) and CONICET (Argentine Scientific and Technical Research Council) for the provision of scholarships for J.

J,"Bhattacharyya, SS; Thakre, S",,,,"Bhattacharyya, Som Sekhar; Thakre, Shreyash",,,Coronavirus pandemic and economic lockdown; study of strategic initiatives and tactical responses of firms,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS,,,English,Article; Early Access,,,,,,Business continuity; Economic lockdown; Organizational tactics; Pandemic crisis; Strategic initiatives,,"Purpose The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) and the associated economic lockdown provided a jolt to businesses around the world and the global economy. Amid the ongoing uncertainty, circumstances varied across business sectors and regions, but the common goal for business organizations was to respond effectively, devising strategies to survive the turmoil and accelerate recovery. The narrative in India was no different from the rest of the world. Due to the novelty of the event, literature regarding its impact on the strategic management of firms was scarce. Thus, this paper aims to attempt to ascertain the crisis impact on firms and subsequently unravel the tactical short-term and long-term strategic responses initiated by Indian firms. Design/methodology/approach The authors carried out an empirical investigation to comprehend the strategic foresight adopted by Indian firms. Following a structured literature review, the authors conducted semi-structured open-ended interviews with 28 business experts who were involved in drafting strategic responses for their respective firms. Subsequently, the authors performed a thematic content analysis of the expert interview responses to document firm-level strategic responses to the COVID-19 crisis and associated economic lockdown. The authors further searched reputed media articles to supplement and triangulate the primary research findings with management perspectives. Findings The authors identified that managers had adopted a dual approach responding to the disruption. Companies simultaneously focused on surviving the crisis in the short-term by reconfiguring existing resources and initiated long-term recovery by mobilizing efforts for a redesigned business model. The research findings indicated that companies had adapted to the dynamic chaotic crisis environment to fulfill the changed consumer expectations. Remote working was widely implemented, supply networks were adjusted, operations were managed with minimal resources, working capital was closely monitored and the product-portfolio was revamped to reap benefits in an essentials-only world. The impact of several strategic firm responses was determined through this study on the revenue, profitability, operational costs and regulatory adherence of the companies along with the ability to meet stakeholder expectations. The study suggested that companies encouraged innovative solutions and highlighted the importance of collaborative inter-organizational practices. Research limitations/implications The study contributed to an inter-theoretical perspective on firm strategic initiatives to confront a global crisis. Resource-based view, dynamic capabilities perspective and industrial-organizational theory-based perspectives, were applied. This facilitated an extensive analysis of the entire business ecosystem to identify various paths to accelerated recovery during and post COVID-19 world. Practical implications The research findings would aid managers in drafting a comprehensive response strategy during and post COVID-19 world. This study results would help managers in addressing multiple concerns such as the sustainability of operations in the short-term through working capital management, the fulfillment of changing consumer needs through sustained innovation and business model alterations to ensure long term growth. The study enabled managers to prioritize necessary actions, ascertain the impact of strategic initiatives and build sustainable competitive advantage for long-term growth. Originality/value The novel coronavirus pandemic and the associated economic lockdown impacted firm strategies and this was one of the very first empirical studies regarding how firm-level short-term tactics and long-term strategies were getting reshaped. Traditionally, companies were prepared to handle localized disruptions but a crisis of such epic global proportions jeopardized most business. This study provided an extensive review of the short-term tactical and long-term strategic response perspectives adopted by Indian firms to absorb the impact of this unique crisis and expected recovery with renewed strength. This was one of the first research articles to provide an inter-theoretical perspective on the ongoing global pandemic. This integrated view of the possible impacts of firm-level strategic initiatives provided a detailed knowledge repository to design the crisis response capability of firms.","[Bhattacharyya, Som Sekhar] Natl Inst Ind Engn, Dept Strateg Management, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Thakre, Shreyash] Natl Inst Ind Engn, Dept Management, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India","Bhattacharyya, SS (corresponding author), Natl Inst Ind Engn, Dept Strateg Management, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.",somdata@gmail.com; shreyashthakre31@gmail.com,,,,,,143,0,0,8,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1934-8835,1758-8561,,INT J ORGAN ANAL,Int.

Different from other oil and gas supply infrastructures, oil and gas pipelines may be more vulnerable to accidental, natural and intentional threats due to their widespread distribution. Therefore a systematic and thorough review is carried out to investigate safety and security of oil and gas pipelines based on bibliometric analysis. First, a total of 598 publications between 1970 and 2019 related to safety and security of oil and natural gas pipelines was retrieved and refined from the database of Web of Science (WoS). The 598 publications are analyzed by the bibliometric software VOSviewer to obtain the temporal and regional distribution of publications, to identify productive institutions and productive authors, and create the cooperation networks between institutions and authors. Besides, the evolution of research topics and research methods are identified based on keywords and bibliographic analysis. Moreover, the main research topics and research methods are analyzed to obtain insight into the research evolutions and trends. Risk assessment, leakage, and corrosion are the main topics while QRA, fuzzy theory and the Bayesian network are the most frequently used research methods. To further improve the sustainability of oil and gas pipelines, this study provides and discusses future research needs such as pipeline security, environmental sustainability, pipeline system resilience. According to these results, the research on risk assessment based on Bayesian network and consequence analysis using CFD may increase in the future. Besides, more research and guidelines on pipeline security, resilience, and environmental impacts to better protect pipelines, are expected. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, pellet storage during transportation can compromise their properties, due to fluctuating temperature and humid environments. Here, we show that extended storage of one month at 40 degrees C and 85% relative humidity causes significant biomass pellet degradation. This was evidenced by higher pellet porosity, weight gain, increased inclusion body formation and creation of an internal network of cracks. We quantify the inclusion and pore growth processes at the surface and within the pellets, which has implications for subsequent thermochemical conversion. The global bioenergy transition may depend upon biomass pellets, and this study shows that storage conditions are critical in the supply chain, so to maintain their quality. Without the development of stronger policies to avoid premature degradation of biomass pellets, they may not realize their full potential as a bioenergy source.","[Cutz, Luis; de Jong, Wiebren] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Mech Maritime & Mat Engn, Sect Large Scale Energy Storage LSE, Dept Proc & Energy, Delft, Netherlands; [Tiringer, Ursa; Mol, Arjan] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Mech Maritime & Mat Engn, Sect Corros Technol & Electrochem, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Delft, Netherlands; [Gilvari, Hamid; Schott, Dingena] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Mech Maritime & Mat Engn, Sect Transport Engn & Logist, Dept Maritime & Transport Technol, Delft, Netherlands","Cutz, L; de Jong, W (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Mech Maritime & Mat Engn, Sect Large Scale Energy Storage LSE, Dept Proc & Energy, Delft, Netherlands.",luis.cutz@tudelft.nl; Wiebren.deJong@tudelft.nl,"Gilvari, Hamid/AAU-5394-2020; Mol, Arjan/E-4730-2012","Gilvari, Hamid/0000-0002-5434-8649; Mol, Arjan/0000-0003-1810-5145",Top Consortium for Knowledge and Innovation for the Biobased Economy under grant TKI-BBE project [BBE-1801]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skodowska-Curie grant [707404]; TKI BioBased Economy project [1713],"This work was supported by the Top Consortium for Knowledge and Innovation for the Biobased Economy under grant TKI-BBE project number BBE-1801.

Thus, the aim of this research is the modelling of the sustainable based multi-tier system for AFSC, which is managed through the different emerging application of Internet of things (IoT) technology. Different IoT technologies, viz., Blockchain, robotics, Big data analysis, and cloud computing, have developed a competitive AFSC at the global level. Competitive AFSC needs cautious incorporation of multi-tiers suppliers, specifically during dealing with globalised sustainability issues. Firms have been advancing towards their multi suppliers for driving social, environments and economical practices. This paper also studies the interrelationship of 14 enablers and their cause and effect magnitude as contributing to IoT-based food secure model. The methodology used in the paper is interpretative structural modelling (ISM) for establishing interrelationship among the enablers and Fuzzy-Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (F-DEMATEL) to provide the magnitude of the cause-effect strength of the hierarchical framework. This paper also provides some theoretical contribution supported by information processing theory (IPT) and dynamic capability theory (DCT). This paper may guide the organisation's managers in their strategic planning based on enabler's classification into cause and effect groups.

Recently, closed-loop supply chain management has become a topic of strategic importance due to its positive environmental and economic impacts. As a result, many organizations integrated manufacturing and remanufacturing operations to optimize the efficiency of their forward and reverse supply chain processes. The focus of this research is to integrate cyclic production scheduling policies in a two-stage closed-loop supply chain. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program to generate an optimal cyclic production schedule with no demand shortages that minimizes the sum of holding and setup costs under a given cyclic delivery schedule required by the customer. The results of the sensitivity analysis revealed that the number of products, the product return rate, and the feasibility ratio are the most critical parameters affecting the model computational performance. For large-sized problems, a heuristic procedure is proposed to generate near optimal production schedules in reasonable computational times. Finally, the illustration of the proposed integrated model with a real case study demonstrated the cost advantage of implementing cyclic production schedules under closed-loop supply chain policy versus cyclic production schedules under manufacturing only policy.

The lead times between nodes and production capacity limits are heterogeneous across the network. This study focuses on a single product, a multi-period centralized system in which a retailer is subject to an uncertain stationary consumer demand at each time period. Two sales scenarios are considered for any unfulfilled demand: backlogging or lost sales. The daily inventory replenishment requests from immediate suppliers throughout the network are modeled and optimized using three different approaches: (1) deterministic linear programming, (2) multi-stage stochastic linear programming, and (3) reinforcement learning. The performance of the three methods is compared and contrasted in terms of profit (reward), service level, and inventory profiles throughout the supply chain. The proposed optimization strategies are tested in a stochastic simulation environment that was built upon the open-source OR-Gym Python package. The results indicate that, of the three approaches, stochastic modeling yields the largest increase in profit, whereas reinforcement learning creates more balanced inventory policies that would potentially respond well to network disruptions. Furthermore, deterministic models perform well in determining dynamic reorder policies that are comparable to reinforcement learning in terms of their profitability.","[Perez, Hector D.; Hubbs, Christian D.; Li, Can; Grossmann, Ignacio E.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15123 USA","Grossmann, IE (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15123 USA.",hperezpa@andrew.cmu.edu; chubbs@andrew.cmu.edu; canl1@andrew.cmu.edu; grossmann@cmu.edu,,"Grossmann, Ignacio/0000-0002-7210-084X",Center for Advanced Process Decision-making (CAPD) at Carnegie Mellon University,The authors acknowledge the support from the Center for Advanced Process Decision-making (CAPD) at Carnegie Mellon University.,,26,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9717,,PROCESSES,Processes,JAN,2021,9,1,,,,,,,102,10.3390/pr9010102,,,17,"Engineering, Chemical",Engineering,PW5RI,WOS:000610727000001,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

To address this issue, this paper applies uncertainty theory to two-stage network DEA intending to deal with inaccurate data. Moreover, the bi-echelon supply chain generally suffers asymmetric power among involved members. Therefore, this paper proposes attrition rate (D) and fulfillment rate (G) in the first and second stages respectively so as to reveal the bi-echelon supply chain within different leader-follower patterns. The first two models assume the upstream firm is the leader while the last two models regard the downstream firm as the leader. We find out that the results of the evaluation vary under divergent patterns accordingly by running a numerical example. Adopting proposed models can help decision-makers of the multistage supply chain make decisions more effectively and avoid possible mistakes.","[Jiang, B.; Peng, L.; Li, J.] Ocean Univ China, Dept Int Trade & Econ, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Li, J.] Ocean Univ China, Marine Dev Studies Inst, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Lio, W.] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Math Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Li, J (corresponding author), Ocean Univ China, Dept Int Trade & Econ, Qingdao, Peoples R China.; Li, J (corresponding author), Ocean Univ China, Marine Dev Studies Inst, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",jiangbao@ouc.edu.cn; psycheply@163.com; lijian@ouc.edu.cn; liaowj18@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61873329],This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China of No.61873329.,,40,0,0,1,1,UNIV SISTAN & BALUCHESTAN,ZAHEDAN,"PO BOX 98135-987, ZAHEDAN, 00000, IRAN",1735-0654,,,IRAN J FUZZY SYST,Iran.

Three theoretical perspectives, namely, relational view, knowledge-based view and resource-based view, have been employed. The results demonstrate that MKCs are substantiated by three critical components, in which the local knowledge cluster can develop global systemic mechanisms, thus further strengthening global linkages. Policy makers must endeavor to create a conducive local cluster environment with maritime firms being located in geographical proximity, and having local networks, knowledge base, and knowledge flows. They form the fundamental foundation for the growth of MKCs. Besides, maritime firms shall optimize the MKC's local knowledge cluster to facilitate their global expansion, which will in turn boost the internationalization of the MKC.","[Zhou, Yusheng; Yuen, Kum Fai; Tan, Beverly] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Singapore, Singapore; [Thai, Vinh V.] RMIT Univ, Sch Accounting Informat Syst & Supply Chain, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Thai, VV (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Accounting Informat Syst & Supply Chain, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",vinh.thai@rmit.edu.auV.V,"; Yuen, Kum Fai/B-8244-2015","Zhou, Yusheng/0000-0002-8795-3423; Yuen, Kum Fai/0000-0002-9199-6661",,,,68,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-597X,1872-9460,,MAR POLICY,Mar.

Both positive and negative events tend to cause disruptions and affect business operations continuity. Supplier selection, being the critical and foremost activity must ensure that selected suppliers are capable of supporting the organizations against disruptions caused by these events. Hence, supplier selection and order allocation must be restructured considering the dynamics of Industry 4.0 and disaster events to ensure undisrupted flow of materials across supply chain. The paper proposes a multi stage hybrid model for integrated supplier segmentation, selection and order allocation considering risks and disruptions. The suppliers are then evaluated based on set of criteria suitable in Industry 4.0 environment using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and are further prioritized using Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FAHP-TOPSIS). The risk associated with each supplier is computed. The paper also proposes a Mixed Integer Program (MIP) as to optimize multi-period, multi item order allocation to suppliers in such a way that overall cost and risk of disruption is simultaneously minimized. In event of any disruption either from supply or demand side, the multi-stage hybrid model tends to reduce its economic impact by allocating emergency orders, thus, ensuring business operations continuity. The proposed multi-stage hybrid model is illustrated using a case of an automobile company.","[Kaur, Harpreet] Indian Inst Management Amritsar, Amritsar, Punjab, India; [Singh, Surya Prakash] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Management Studies, New Delhi, India","Singh, SP (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Management Studies, New Delhi, India.",harpreetk.iitd@gmail.com; surya.singh@gmail.com,,,,,,71,0,0,9,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-5273,1873-7579,,INT J PROD ECON,Int.

The study draws policy implications, especially for farming systems resilience and the achievement of SDGs 1 and 2. The findings are based on (i) three panel discussions over six months with policy makers and experts working at grassroots to understand and manage the crisis, (ii) key informants' interviews, and (iii) an extensive literature review. Results revealed that the lockdown and transport restrictions have had severe consequences, raising questions on the achievement of SDGs 1 and 2, especially in the already vulnerable regions dependent on food-aid. This crisis has also exposed the strengths and limitations of both subsistence and commercial farming systems in terms of resiliency, offering important lessons for policy makers. Traditional subsistence farming appears to be somewhat resilient, with a potential to contribute to key pillars of food security, especially access and stability, though with limited contributions to food availability because of low productivity. On the other hand, commercial farming limited to the periphery of market centres, cities, and emerging towns and in the accessible areas was more impacted due to the lack of resilient supply networks to reach even the local market. Lower resiliency of commercial farming was also evident because of its growing dependence on inputs (mainly seeds and fertilizer) on distant markets located in foreign countries. The observation of crisis over eight months unleashed by the pandemic clearly revealed that wage labourers, indigenous people, and women from marginalized groups and regions already vulnerable in food security and malnutrition suffered more due to COVID-19 as they lost both external support and the coping mechanisms. The findings have implications for policies to improve both subsistence and commercial farming systems - in particular the former by improving the productivity through quality inputs and by diversifying, promoting and protecting the indigenous food system, while the latter through sustainable intensification by building reliant supply network linking farming with markets and guarantying the supply of inputs.","[Adhikari, Jagannath] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Timsina, Jagadish; Ojha, Hemant] Inst Study & Dev Worldwide, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Timsina, Jagadish] Global Ever Greening Alliance, 1 Vis Dr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Khadka, Sarba Raj] FIAN Int Board, Heidelberg, Germany; [Ghale, Yamuna] Agr Food Secur & Gender, Kathmandu, Nepal","Adhikari, J (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",jagannath.adhikari@gmail.com,,,,,,54,0,0,15,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-521X,1873-2267,,AGR SYST,Agric.

Therefore, the sustainability of food supply chains has gained ground; however, the sustainability of perishable food supply chains, is still not a fully explored field of study. Therefore, in this research, a multi-objective mathematical programming model is developed to optimize the cost, energy consumption, and the traffic congestion associated with such supply chain operations. In this study, product lifetime uncertainty is explicitly modeled as a Weibull random variable, and food perishability is assumed to be affected by vehicle refrigerator utilization, which is considered as a decision variable. In addition, multiple vehicle types and multiple product types are considered. A dairy supply chain case is investigated, and the interrelations and interactions of all three aspects of sustainability, also known as the three triple bottom lines (TBL) of sustainability, are studied. The results indicate that emphasizing the economic aspect, for highly perishable products, the environmental impact of the chain may increase by 120%, and for the highly congested road networks, the social impact may rise by 51%. However, a 15% economic compromise can improve the sustainability of the supply chain network design by 150%. It is also shown that road congestion and the uncertain perishability of the products are critical factors that can, although differently, affect the operation and the design of the supply chain. This study contributes to the sustainable development goals (SDG's) such as Zero Hunger (SDG 2); Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7); Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8); Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (SDG 9); Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12); Climate Action (SDG 13) and Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions (SDG 16). The results suggest that decision-makers can significantly reduce the environmental and social influences of the supply chain even without drastically compromising the economic aspect.

In the last few decades, biodiesel has been introduced as an alternative due to its advantages over fossil fuels, which include higher flash point, improved lubricity, and lower toxicity. However, high production cost of biodiesel is one of the major hindrances in making the commercial feasibility of biodiesel viable. Biodiesel can be obtained from various sources such as waste cooking oil, vegetable oil, animal fat, etc. Among these sources, animal fat which is a non-edible feedstock and currently being used in low-cost processes is one of the best options. To make the commercial feasibility of biodiesel viable, this research presents an animal fat-based bio-diesel supply chain network design optimization model. The suggested optimization model minimizes the cost of total biodiesel supply chain operations besides minimizing the carbon emissions during the involved operations. The complex and dynamic business environment of the biodiesel supply chain leads to a high degree of uncertainty, as a result, the effectiveness of strategic level decisions is compromised. To model this uncertainty, a solution methodology based on robust possibilistic programming (RPP) is employed. To show the applicability of the proposed model and solution methodology, numerical experiments and sensitivity analysis on a real case study is performed. Case results depict that RPP based solution methodology can achieve efficient solutions having a high degree of robustness. The experimental results also indicate that by investing almost 16% higher cost, the strategic and tactical level decisions of the proposed biodiesel supply chain model can be secured against the inherent uncertainty. It is also revealed that for the given case, logistics-related activities are almost 80% of the total supply chain cost, which if managed efficiently, can play a significant role in making the commercial feasibility of biodiesel doable. The proposed model and its findings can be efficiently utilized by the policymakers and investors in the animal fat-based biodiesel production sector. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Steel is one of the most critical raw materials practically used in every aspect of our life, directly or indirectly influencing the industry and economy of a country. The final products of the steel industry can be reused at the end of their lifecycle, making the principles of reverse logistics applicable in the supply chain and turning it to a closed-loop supply chain. In this research, a multi-objective linear mathematical model under uncertainty is developed to optimize a steel sustainable closed-loop supply chain. The existed uncertainty is modeled through a scenario-based method in the stochastic environment, and the proposed multi-objective model is developed following a fuzzy goal programming approach. A real case study is explored in one of the active steel supply chains in Iran to validate the model. The model optimizes total profit, energy, and water consumption, CO2 emission, job opportunity created, and lost working days through determining optimal production technology, whether retailers get changed to hybrid centers or not, and the flow of material and products. The final results show that a mere 1% decrease in the profit can alleviate the harmful environmental effects by 5%. Finally, several managerial implications derived from final results and sensitivity analysis are discussed to provide insights for industry leaders who desire to increase their profits with regard to environmental and social effects.

This study demonstrates that estimating betweenness centrality is meaningful and less computationally expensive, and can help us to understand the structural positions in the global supply chain network.

Uncertainty is always found in electricity demand prediction and perfect foresight is not possible. The resilience of electricity networks in face of uncertainty can prevent catastrophic impacts. Besides, due to the growing concerns about social impacts, considering social measures along with the other measures is becoming critical when analyzing the network costs. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization model is developed, which consists of the total cost in the first objective, resiliency measures in the second objective, and some aspects of corporate social responsibility in the third objective. The resiliency measures minimize de-resiliency, including successive establishment, distributed generators inadequacy, congestion through electrical lines, and energy dissatisfaction level. A novel robust approach is also proposed to deal with the uncertainty of electricity demand based on the light robust programming and possibilistic theory in the fuzzy logic. By investigating a real case in Iran, the contributions of the considered measures, and the effects of uncertainty are analyzed. The analyses reveal that by applying the proposed model the decision-makers can enhance corporate social responsibility and resiliency by 50% and 20%, respectively, although it increases the total cost by 50%. Moreover, the results of applying the proposed fuzzy-robust approach show that how the decision-makers can effectively allocate the uncertainty budget and protection level to attain more robust solutions in terms of standard deviation and mean value of the total cost.","[Hosseini-Motlagh, Seyyed-Mahdi; Samani, Mohammad Reza Ghatreh] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Ind Engn, Univ Ave, Tehran 16846, Iran; [Shahbazbegian, Vahid] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Daneshjou Blvd, Tehran 1983969411, Iran","Hosseini-Motlagh, SM (corresponding author), Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Ind Engn, Univ Ave, Tehran 16846, Iran.",motlagh@iust.ac.ir; mr_samani@ind.iust.ac.ir; v.shahbazbagian@mail.sbu.ac.ir,"Shahbazbegian, Vahid/AAC-7964-2021; Hosseini-Motlagh, Seyyed-Mahdi/L-5523-2018","Shahbazbegian, Vahid/0000-0003-2934-8310; Hosseini-Motlagh, Seyyed-Mahdi/0000-0003-2568-187X",,,,69,0,0,3,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-2619,1872-9118,,APPL ENERG,Appl.

This is because the joint decisions can ensure firms to obtain higher profits while contributing to sustainable environments. However, due to the problem complexity, no models facilitating such decision making are available. This study aims to develop a model to help firms make optimal joint decisions. To model the situations where a manufacturer is the leader and the retailers are followers, we adopt the Stackelberg game theory and develop a 0- 1 mixed nonlinear bilevel program to maximize the profits of both the manufacturer and his retailers. We further develop a nested genetic algorithm to solve the game model. Numerical examples demonstrate (i) the applicability of the game model and the algorithm and (ii) the robustness of the algorithm. Managerial insights are obtained, suggesting that (i) manufacturers need to identify the capacity ranges (called capacity traps) where capacity increases result in reduced profits when making decisions to optimize profits; (ii) retailers should make suitable, e.g., pricing decisions so that the manufacturers can include them in the supply chains; (iii) both manufacturers and retailers may not need to consider the carbon emission buying (or selling) price when making decisions.

This study presents an agent-based model capturing the behaviour of firms facing transport and supply disruptions due to natural disasters, and shows possible paths to reinforce infrastructure and supply chain resilience. Building resilience against shocks has become a pillar of sustainability. By understanding how the different components of an economy interact in times of crisis, we can design resilience strategies that go beyond building walls or dams. We formulate an original agent-based model to explore a crucial pathway through which a disaster affects the economy: the transport-supply chain nexus. The model simulates the behaviour of firms facing transport and supply disruptions and estimates the resulting indirect losses. As an illustration, the model is used to assess the criticality of Tanzanian roads, which are vulnerable to floods. We report three main results. First, the model generates maps that identify the transport infrastructure assets that are most critical for specific supply chains: roads that are most important for food security are different from those supporting international trade, for instance. Second, economic losses from transport disruptions increase non-linearly with the duration of disruptions, highlighting the benefit from fast repairs. Third, by combining economic and transport modelling, we can consider a broader spectrum of interventions. Beyond strengthening the transport system, it is also possible to make supply chains more resilient to disruption with, for instance, sourcing decisions or inventory management.","[Colon, Celian] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria; [Hallegatte, Stephane; Rozenberg, Julie] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA","Colon, C (corresponding author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria.",celian.colon@polytechnique.edu,,,Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery; International Institute for Applied System Analysis,"We thank J.

Compared with much literature for the industrial symbiosis optimization about waste energy and wastewater, this paper proposes an industrial symbiosis optimization model based on the waste material recycling and exchanging network. By-products from the production process are considered the main components of waste material flows. A Mixed-integer programming method is employed to formulate the optimization model. In response to the three pillars of sustainability, three sub-objectives, namely the economy, environment, and society, are built for the proposed optimization model. The Epsilon-constraint technology is established to tackle the multiobjective model efficiently. Decisions on waste material recycling and exchanging flow are formulated in the proposed model, as well as options on reprocessing sites and reprocessing technology levels. The results show that the proposed Mixed-Inter Programming optimization method and Epsilon-constraint technology are sufficient to obtain the solutions of industrial symbiosis optimization. Technology level decisions integrated into the optimization model can balance the objectives of economy, environment, and society and provide a more extensive decision option space for managers. Raw material price and by-product recycling cost are two main elements of the waste material exchanging of industrial symbiosis optimization based on the parameter robustness analysis. Multi-objective optimization of waste material reprocessing and exchange network allows managers to make decisions based on different objective priorities. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This assessment shall be able to integrate qualitative and quantitative factors in the model, which is critical in sugar supply chains involving multi-stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach Integration of quality function deployment (QFD), the fuzzy analytical network process (FANP) and the data envelopment analysis (DEA) is administered to assess the efficiency score of each stakeholder involved. The evaluation encompasses collaboration behaviour factors since the input of collaboration activities will result in sustainability aspects such as revenue, green house gas (GHG) emissions and social impact. The analysis has been conducted in two scenarios, those are the basic scenario by utilising original data and the extended scenario by using projection data. Findings The result clarifies that the most influential behaviour factor in the collaboration activities is commitment (0.116), while the least important behaviour factors are power (0.008) and adaptation (0.008). Furthermore, by using the extended scenario, the overall efficiency for each benchmarking is higher compared to the condition before the improvement (basic scenario). Research limitations/implications The result of this study is only relevant to the particular sugar supply chain and involving limited sustainability variables. Therefore, in a further study, more variables such as technical and financial aspects could be explored further in the assessment process. Practical implications The result of this study is available for each stakeholder and can be fundamental for the constant improvement in sustainable supply chain (SSC) practices. It shows that an improvement of one stakeholder will positively impact the entire system. Social implications Smallholders and sugarcane farmers will recognise the significance of collaboration behaviour. Thus, they can enhance their mutual benefits by using the existing resources. Originality/value This paper arranges for a practical contribution by implementing advanced assessment methods in the sugar supply chain by taking into account the economic, environmental and social aspects.

Although, nowadays, responsiveness and social responsibility of networks could also be regarded as important measures that could attract more consumers to use hydrogen. Accordingly, this paper aims to improve the reliability and social responsibility of a hydrogen supply chain along with its economic and environmental aspects. To ensure the network's responsiveness, a new objective function is extended that maximizes the reliability of products' delivery. Also, a novel reliability approach is developed to immune the network against disruptions. As a new sustainability indicator, social factors are considered in the design of the hydrogen supply chain. Finally, a mixed possibilistic flexible programming method is proposed to assure the outputs' reliability. The results illustrate that by 28.4% enhancement in cost objective, the value of environmental, social, and reliability objectives are desirably improved 39.2%, 45.6%, and 24.1%, respectively.

This study describes urban and periurban family farmers' ongoing strategies to adapt to changes in the local food supply chains (FSCs) after the temporary suspension of farmers' markets and government programs directed to small-scale agriculture. Their disruption proved problematic for the farmers and the vulnerable populations served by them. As a result, some farmers redirected their products' commercialization to delivery or pickup services. Based on observations and conversations with producers and retail intermediaries, we show that farmers' delivery and pickup-based sales increased dramatically with the pandemic. The sustainability of these practices is unknown, although they have strengthened forms of cooperation and commercialization amongst farmers, mainly through online marketing.

Biodiesel has been introduced as an alternative owing to its wide commercial applications. It can be produced from various types of biomass including vegetable oil, used cooking oil, and animal fat. Of these, animal fat is a promising option because of its low cost and easy availability. For a speedy transition toward large-scale commercially viable biodiesel production, the efficient design of a biodiesel supply chain is very important. Moreover, because biodiesel supply chain (SC) design decisions directly influence social and environmental aspects, hence SC optimization within the sustainability paradigm is necessary. This research proposes a waste-animal-fat-based biodiesel SC optimization model that minimizes environmental impact and SC cost while maximizing social wellbeing. The complex and dynamic environment of biodiesel production brings a high level of uncertainty, which compromises the effectiveness of SC decisions; thus, a modified robust possibilistic chance-constrained programming solution methodology is developed. To validate the proposed model and solution methodology, a computational analysis of a case study is performed. The results demonstrate that by paying 1.13% higher costs, a desirable level of social and environmental protection can be achieved for the proposed supply chain. It is also found that with an increase of 5% in the economic objective, 6% increase in the environmental objective, and 7% decrease in the social objective, the risk of epistemic uncertainty can be completely ruled out. Further, from the numerical analysis it is inferred that among all tiers of biodiesel SC, the decisions of the biorefinery tier play a crucial role in achieving sustainable development goals. Furthermore, a higher priority of economic and environmental objectives makes the SC decisions more centralized, whereas a higher priority of the social objective makes them more decentralized. The proposed model can be useful to investors and policymakers involved in biodiesel production and distribution.","[Habib, Muhammad Salman; Zahoor, Sadaf] Univ Engn & Technol Lahore, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, Lahore, Pakistan; [Tayyab, Muhammad] Lahore Univ Management Sci, Suleman Dawood Sch Business, Lahore 54792, Pakistan; [Zahoor, Sadaf] Univ Windsor, Fac Engn, Mech Automot & Mat Engn, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; [Sarkar, Biswajit] Yonsei Univ, Dept Ind Engn, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea","Sarkar, B (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Ind Engn, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea.",bsbiswajitsarkar@gmail.com,,"Muhammad, Tayyab/0000-0001-7092-7440; Habib, Muhammad Salman/0000-0003-3892-7234",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea Government (MSIT) [NRF2020R1F1A1064460],The work is supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea Government (MSIT) (NRF2020R1F1A1064460).,,59,0,0,1,1,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0196-8904,1879-2227,,ENERG CONVERS MANAGE,Energy Conv.

What implications can be derived for future research and practices concerning sustainability issues? In this conceptual article, we critically discuss the current status of complexity research in EM. In this regard, we use IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, because it is currently considered the leading journal in EM, and is as a reliable, heuristic proxy. From this journal, we analyze 38 representative publications on the topic published since 2000, and extrapolated through a rigorous keyword-based article search. In particular, we show that: (1) the adoption of CT has been associated with a wide range of key themes in EM, such as new product development, supply chain, and project management. (2) The adoption of CT has been witnessed in an increasing amount of publications, with a focus on conceptual modeling based on fuzzy logics, stochastic, or agent-based modeling prevailing. (3) Many key features of CT seem to be quite clearly observable in our dataset, with modeling and optimizing decision making, under uncertainty, as the dominant theme. However, only a limited number of studies appear to formally adhere to CT, to explain the different EM issues investigated. Thus, we derive various implications for EM research (concerning the research in and practice on sustainability issues).","[Abatecola, Gianpaolo] Tor Vergata Univ Rome, Sch Econ, Dept Management & Law, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Surace, Alberto] Italian Minist Def, CASD Ctr Def Higher Studies, I-00165 Rome, Italy","Abatecola, G (corresponding author), Tor Vergata Univ Rome, Sch Econ, Dept Management & Law, I-00133 Rome, Italy.; Surace, A (corresponding author), Italian Minist Def, CASD Ctr Def Higher Studies, I-00165 Rome, Italy.",abatecola@economia.uniroma2.it; alberto.surace@aeronautica.difesa.it,,"ABATECOLA, GIANPAOLO/0000-0002-3050-0554",,,,99,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2020,12,24,,,,,,,10629,10.3390/su122410629,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PL8DH,WOS:000603344800001,,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2021-03-04

Field research was conducted through a structured questionnaire contacted to 134 executives of firms in the agri-food sector in Greece. The results reveal that information sharing, logistics networking and transportation are the most powerful factors that impact sustainable, business and supply chain performance. In addition, green packaging is related to financial and social performance aspects. Interestingly, green warehousing and logistics emissions failed to establish any relationship with performance outcomes.

Using secondary data from diverse sources on the supply networks of 319 firms, extending to the Tier-2 level, we present and test a robust empirical model that also accounts for potential endogeneity effects. To understand this key relationship between BSN complexity and environmental performance at a deeper level, we further test the moderating influence of BSN members' reach on this key relationship. We also test the moderating effects of a focal firm's control over its BSN on this key relationship. We find that both the vertical complexity dimension and the horizontal complexity dimension of BSNs had a U-shaped relationship with the participating firms' GHG emissions. In contrast, the spatial complexity dimension of BSNs had a positive impact on the participating firms' GHG emissions. With respect to the moderating effects, we found that firms' control over their BSN negatively influenced these relationships, whereas the reach of the BSN members positively influenced these relationships. Taken together, this set of mixed-pattern findings casts new light on the broad literature of multitier BSNs, environmental sustainability, and the effective management of supply chains.

Nevertheless, it has not been sufficiently quantified in the related literature. This study provides a new metric to quantify the SC resilience by using the stochastic programming. Our metric measures the expected value of the SC's cost increase due to a possible disruption event during its recovery period. Based on this measure, we propose a two-stage stochastic program for the supply chain network design under disruption events that optimizes location, allocation, inventory and order-size decisions. The stochastic program is formulated using quadratic conic optimization, and the sample average approximation (SAA) method is employed to handle the large number of disruption scenarios. A comprehensive computational study is carried out to highlight the applicability of the presented metric, the computational tractability of the stochastic program, and the performance of the SAA. Several key managerial and practical insights are gained based on the computational results. This new metric captures the time and cost of the SC's recovery after disruption events contrast to most of previous studies and main impacts of these two aspects on design decisions are highlighted. Further, it is shown computationally that the increase of SC's capacity is not a suitable strategy for designing resilient SCs in some business environments.","[Fattahi, Mohammad] Shahrood Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Shahrood, Iran; [Govindan, Kannan] Shanghai Maritime Univ, China Inst FTZ Supply Chain, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Govindan, Kannan] Univ Southern Denmark, Ctr Sustainable Supply Chain Engn, Danish Inst Adv Study, Dept Technol & Innovat, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Maihami, Reza] Our Lady Lake Univ, Sch Business & Leadership, San Antonio, TX 78207 USA","Govindan, K (corresponding author), Shanghai Maritime Univ, China Inst FTZ Supply Chain, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.",mohammadfattahy@gmail.com; kgov@iti.sdu.dk,"govindan, kannan/M-5996-2017","govindan, kannan/0000-0002-6204-1196",,,,55,2,2,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-5273,1873-7579,,INT J PROD ECON,Int.

Existing resilience metrics require detailed knowledge of the system and potential disruptions, which is not available in the early design stage. The lack of quantitative tools to guide the early stages of design for resilience, forces engineers to rely on heuristics (use physical redundancy, localized capacity, etc.). This research asserts that the required quantitative guidelines can be developed using the architecting principles of biological ecosystems, which maintain a unique balance between pathway redundancy and efficiency, enabling them to be both productive under normal circumstances and survive disruptions. Ecologists quantify this network characteristic using the ecological fitness function. This paper presents the required reformulation required to enable the use of this metric in the design and analysis of resource and infrastructure networks with multiple distinct, but interdependent, interactions. The proposed framework is validated by comparing the resilience characteristics of two notional supply chain designs: one designed for minimum shipping cost and the other designed using the proposed bio-inspired framework. The results support using the proposed bio-inspired framework to guide designers in creating resilient and sustainable resource and infrastructure networks.","[Chatterjee, Abheek; Layton, Astrid] Texas A&M Univ, J Mike Walker 66 Dept Mech Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Layton, A (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, J Mike Walker 66 Dept Mech Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",alayton@tamu.edu,,"Layton, Astrid/0000-0003-3790-2916",Texas AM University,The authors would like to thank Texas A&M University for supporting this research and fellow BiSSL members Colton Brehm and Tirth Dave for insightful comments and discussions.,,93,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0951-8320,1879-0836,,RELIAB ENG SYST SAFE,Reliab.

Water supply chain aims to manage the water consumption and to control the water shortage. Contrary to most of previous studies focused on the forward directions of the water supply chain, this paper also considers the reverse logistics known as a Closed-Loop Supply Chain (CLSC). Hence, an integrated Water Supply and Wastewater Collection System (WSWCS) under uncertainty is proposed. Furthermore, regarding the trend of sustainable development, the environmental dimensions and social benefits of the integrated WSWCS are contributed. To meet the standards of the sustainable development in developing countries, a case study in Iran is applied to a novel multi-objective stochastic optimization model based on triple bottom lines of sustainability. Having already been employed to similar optimization problems, the Social Engineering Optimizer (SEO) has been never applied in this research area. Another innovation of this study is to introduce an improved multi-objective SEO to solve this complicated model.

Because partner selection is critical to supply chain management, focal firms now need to select supply chains partners that can offer a high level of competence in sustainability. This paper proposes a novel multi-partner classification model for the partner qualification and classification process, combining ensemble learning technology and fuzzy set theory. The proposed model enables potential partners to be classified into one of four categories (strategic partner, preference partner, leverage partner and routine partner), thereby allowing distinctive partner management strategies to be applied for each category. The model provides for the simultaneous optimization of both efficiency in its use of multi-partner and multi-dimension evaluation data, and effectiveness in dealing with the vagueness and uncertainty of linguistic commentary data, in the partner evaluation process. Compared to more conventional methods, the proposed model has the advantage of offering a simple classification and a stable prediction performance.

The Upgral Paradigm is an integrated model for the location-inventory-routing problem in a four-level supply chain where parameters such as demand, facility cost and inventory costs are taken into account uncertain as triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs). In this study, the characteristics and capabilities of passive defense in the supply chain, such as logistical flow rate, backup path security, the possibility of resource and equipment deployment, and the dispersion principle were considered for location to increase the resilience of supply chain. The model was solved using Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and NSGA-II meta-heuristic algorithm. First, a four-objective mathematical model was proposed for the problem the objectives of which were: 1) minimizing supply chain costs; 2) maximizing social responsibility or social benefits; 3) minimizing environmental impacts; and 4) minimizing risk. Moreover, the experimental sample problems were solved in three small, medium, and large groups using the WOA Algorithm. The results of solving this algorithm were compared with the results of NSGA-II one according to the indices including quality, dispersion, uniformity and solution time indices to prove the efficiency of the algorithm. Based on the results, the WOA algorithm had a higher ability to achieve higher quality and near-optimal solutions than NSGA-II algorithm in all cases. The dispersion index values indicated that the WOA Algorithm performed better in exploring and extracting the feasible region. In addition, with respect to the results of the uniformity and the solution time indices, it was found that the NSGA-II Algorithm had a lower solution time than the WOA Algorithm and the answer space more uniformly.","[Ayoughi, Hamidreza] Islamic Azad Univ, South Tehran Branch, Ind Management Dept, Tehran, Iran; [Podeh, Hossein Dehghani] Malek Ashtar Univ Technol, Fac Management, Dept Management, Tehran, Iran; [Raad, Abbas; Talebi, Davood] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Fac Management & Accounting, Dept Ind Management, Tehran, Iran","Podeh, HD (corresponding author), Malek Ashtar Univ Technol, Fac Management, Dept Management, Tehran, Iran.",hamidreza.ayoughi@iran.ir; dr.hoseinpodeh@gmail.com; a-raad@sbu.ac.ir; talebidavood@yahoo.com,,,,,,40,0,0,22,22,SEMNAN UNIV,SEMNAN,"MOLAVI BLVD, SEMNAN, REPUBLIC ISLAMIC 00000, IRAN",2008-6822,,,INT J NONLINEAR ANAL,Int.

However, the role of the private sector in disaster management operations (DMOs) is not as prominent as the role played by (inter)governmental agencies. This article aims to investigate the relationship of collaboration and resilience in disaster management supply networks (DMSNs). Design/methodology/approach Supply network resilience criteria were defined as robustness, flexibility, velocity and visibility based on the literature review. DMSN capabilities were identified characterising each resilience criterion through the development of the Collaboration-Resilience (COLRES) Analysis Framework for DMSNs. This theoretical model was then applied to an empirical case study in the Philippines using semi-structured interviews for data gathering. Findings A total of 46 cross-sector collaboration activities were identified across four disaster management phases and linked to the resilience criteria. A causal analysis of each collaboration activity and its outcome was conducted to identify relationships between collaboration types and resilience constructs. Based on these results, patterns were identified, and dependencies between collaboration and resilience were defined. Collective DMSN resilience (DMSNRES) enabled by existing cross-sector collaboration activities was evaluated against a future disaster scenario to identify resilience gaps. These gaps were used to recognise new cross-sector collaboration opportunities, thereby illustrating the continuous process of resilience building. Research limitations/implications This research provides new insights on how private sector is involved within a DMOs through collaboration with the government and other NGOs. It augments existing literature on private sector involvement in DMOs where common perception is that the sector is only involved in short-term response and recovery activities. This study finds that the private sector can be operationally involved not just in post-disaster activities, but also in mitigation and preparation phases as well. This then sets a new baseline for further research on private sector involvement within DMOs. As this study provided a novel framework to analyse collaboration activities and its impact to DMSN resilience, future work could be done by applying the model to further cases such as other countries'. DMSNs, or to more specific contexts such as inter-organisational collaborations rather than big sectors. A more detailed assessment method against a future disaster will prove relevance for the model in providing practical insights on how resilience can be built in DMSNs. Practical implications This research proposed a novel DMSN collaboration-resilience (COLRES) model (Figure 11) to analyse existing processes in preparation for specific disasters. Practitioners may be able to use this model with the goal of identifying resilience gaps to fill and continuously improve their processes. The model also provides practitioners the lens to improve processes with the perspective on collaboration to complement government and NGO efforts and expertise with those of the private sector. For the private sector perspective, this research provides new insights on how they can be more involved with the community to provide more sustainable and long-term contributions to the society. Social implications With disasters becoming more complex and frequent by the day and as humanitarian actors focus on improving their expertise, the need for every piece of the society to contribute to disaster risk reduction is continuously intensified. This research shows that each sector of the society can take part in disaster management operations to reduce unpredictability, lives impacted and increase speed of response and recovery. Each sector of the society can be of great contribution not only during post-disaster response and recovery but also during pre-disaster mitigation and preparedness phase. As such, this research echoes the call for everyone to be involved in disaster risk reduction and mitigation as a way of life. Originality/value This research ultimately finds that cross-sector collaboration builds resilience in DMSNs through capacity building, redundancy sourcing, information reliability and logistics responsiveness. This study shows that the private sector is able to go beyond existing short-term partnerships by participating in the 46 collaboration activities identified across four disaster management phases in order to build resilience in DMSNs.","[Medel, Krichelle] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Inst Mfg, Cambridge, England; [Kousar, Rehana; Masood, Tariq] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Global Challenges, Cambridge, England; [Kousar, Rehana] Biomakespace, Cambridge, England; [Masood, Tariq] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Cambridge, England; [Masood, Tariq] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Cambridge, England","Masood, T (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Global Challenges, Cambridge, England.; Masood, T (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Cambridge, England.; Masood, T (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Cambridge, England.",kbdm2@cam.ac.uk; drkousar.r@gmail.com; tm487@cam.ac.uk,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) through the University of Cambridge Institutional Grant 2016-17UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC),"The first phase of this research was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) through the University of Cambridge Institutional Grant 2016-17 entitled Resilient supply chains for disaster relief operations in South Asia.

This paper proposes a reliable model based on mixed-integer programming (MIP) in which the purchasing lot-sizing with all-unit discount and multiple transportation modes, production lot-sizing and scheduling are achieved simultaneously while these decisions are made independently in traditional environments. First, this research examines the maximizing profit with demand choice flexibility in a trade-off with minimizing risk of HAZMAT incidents. Then, the stochastic model with uncertain demand is extended applying the Chance-Constrained Programming (CCP) approach and the results are compared using various datasets. Examinations denote that examples of reasonable sizes in different conditions can be solved in a few seconds. Results show that the deterministic model with demand choice flexibility has a better computational performance than the stochastic model with stochastic demand, but the quality of the stochastic model's solutions is higher than the other one over the various utilization levels of production lines. Based on the results, with increasing the level of utilization, the total profit decreases, and the total risk increases. Furthermore, the results also prove the impact of discount structure on production and purchasing quantities, revenues, costs, and risks. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Food supply chains may have to become more efficient to meet the increasing food requirement of 10 Billion people by 2050. At the same time, food and nutrition security are at risk from increasingly likely shocks like extreme climate events, market shocks, pandemics, changing consumer preferences, and price volatility. Here we consider some possibilities and limitations regarding the improvement of resilience (the capacity to deal with shocks) and efficiency (here interpreted as the share of produced food delivered to consumers) of food supply chains. We employ an Agent Based Model of a generic food chain network consisting of stylized individuals representing producers, traders, and consumers. We do this: 1/to describe the dynamically changing disaggregated flows of crop items between these agents, and 2/to be able to explicitly consider agent behaviour. The agents have implicit personal objectives for trading. We quantify resilience and efficiency by linking these to the fraction of fulfilment of the overall explicit objective to have all consumers meet their food requirement. We consider different types of network structures in combination with different agent interaction types under different types of stylized shocks. We find that generally the network structures with higher efficiency are also more sensitive to shocks, while less efficient network types display more resilience. At first glance these results seem to confirm the existence of a system-level trade-off between resilience and efficiency similar to what is reported in business management and ecology literature. However, the results are modified by the trading interactions and the type of shock. In our simulations resilience and efficiency are affected by `soft' boundaries caused by the preference and trust of agents (i.e., social aspects) in trading. The ability of agents to switch between trading partners represents an important aspect of resilience, namely a capacity to reorganize. These insights may be relevant when considering the reorganization of real-life food chains to increase their resilience to meet future food and nutrition security goals.","[Van Voorn, George; Hengeveld, Geerten; Verhagen, Jan] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen, Netherlands","Van Voorn, G (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen, Netherlands.",george.vanvoorn@wur.nl,,,"Strategic Investment Programme on Resilience of Wageningen University Research; KB 35 Food Security and Valuing Water programme - Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Security","This research was funded by the Strategic Investment Programme on Resilience of Wageningen University & Research and the KB 35 Food Security and Valuing Water programme that is supported by the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Security.

Hence, researchers have been attracted by biomass, especially sugarcane, as a source of renewable energy to produce bioethanol and other biofuels. This research proposes a three-phase robust supply chain network design optimization model to produce bioethanol from sugarcane. Fuzzy integrated data envelopment analysis method is employed to select suitable cultivation lands as supply potential points. The model considers sustainability in its implementation so that the objectives are to maximize the profit, minimize environmental effects, and maximize social performance. Since some parameters are naturally uncertain, a robust possibilistic programming model is proposed, considering the possibility of transportation disruptions. The model performance has been illustrated through a case study in Iran. Finally, the results of the mathematical model have shown that the recommended supply chain design is justifiable. Practical strategic insights include recommendations for locating refineries in seven provinces (Gilan, Kermanshah, Hamedan, Semnan, Khorasan Razavi, Khouzestan, Kihkooliye).

Multiple aspects play critical roles in partner selection, including so many social, environmental, and economic attributes, but considering all of them simultaneously has proved impossible due to limitations in terms of evaluating resources and efficient decision making. Hence, a crucial first step of partner selection in an SSCM context is to decide which criteria to focus on and which to disregard. However, previous literature on partner selection usually treat the establishment of criteria as a given, and also neglect the interrelationships between them. To bridge this research gap, the present study develops a systematic four-stage optimization model for constructing partner selection criteria, based on Dempster-Shafer theory, the improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method. Our model integrates quantitative and qualitative methodologies to identify, group, filter, and analyze potential alternative criteria for partner selection in sustainable supply chains.

To simultaneously address these issues, we propose a comprehensive cold-chain-based low-carbon location-routing-problem optimization model to minimize the total logistics costs and client and vehicle waiting time. The first objective comprises the fixed costs of depots to open and vehicles to rent, vehicle renting cost, driver salaries, fuel consumption cost, carbon emission costs, and damage costs of cargos that need to be refrigerated or frozen. The second objective consists of the waiting time of clients and vehicles to improve client satisfaction and the efficiency of the cold chain logistics network. In the proposed problem, we developed a strategy for improving the efficiency of the cold chain logistics network by mixing the types of cargos arranged in one vehicle. Aiming at efficiently solving the proposed model, six well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) were used by combining an efficient framework, and first (FI) and best-improvement (BI) search mechanisms were considered. In the experiments, we examined the effectiveness of six MOEAs inserting the proposed framework and search mechanisms, and the result showed that NSGA-II/FI, SPEA2/FI, and NSGA-II/BI were the top three MOEAs. In the extensive experiments, the results showed that the delivery strategy, depot cost, depot capacity, crowding distance, and traveling speed have significant effects on the Pareto front, fuel consumption, carbon emission, vehicle and client waiting times, traveling distance, and traveling time.

This research aims at analyzing the complex relationships among stakeholders' green behavior and exploring the driving-paths for green buildings industry based on the network analysis. The green behavior system of six major stakeholders was constructed based on the previous literatures. Then, whole-network analysis explores the visual relationships through questionnaires data, while ego-network analysis presenting by upwards and downwards structure mines the vital driving-paths for green buildings industry. Finally the study reveals, (i) the end-users are critical to the development direction of green buildings industry; (ii) when issuing the incentive policies for green buildings, government should consider creating trade-offs between the incremental cost and profit; (iii) as the main body of green innovation, designers and suppliers are overdependent on governmental incentives.

Design/methodology/approach Based on a review of relevant literature, the authors recognized four criteria and 16 critical factors that have been validated by academic and industry experts. AHP and ANP models are then developed to evaluate the requirements and essential elements of the Industry 4.0 implementation. The outcomes were validated with the aid of sensitivity analysis. Findings The above models offer the industry a clear and straightforward way to understand the critical factors in the status of Industry 4.0 implementation. The two techniques have emerged to be influential in deciding the status of Industry 4.0 implementation. The two methods yielded almost identical outcomes. Both methods take into account the industry's specific needs based on their available capacity. Practical implications Decision-makers and specialists will use the strategies discussed in this paper to effectively include the implementation status of Industry 4.0 in their industries, based on their ability to make arrangements for proper implementation of Industry 4.0 and to concentrate on top priority factors when implementing Industry 4.0 at their workplace. Originality/value The contribution of this research is that it is the first to be carried out with a view to both AHP and ANP to analyze important factors regarding the implementation status of Industry 4.0 and authentication through sensitivity analysis methods; this is a recent initiative in Industry 4.0.","[Nimawat, Dheeraj; Gidwani, B.

Disruptions are one of the supply chain risks that can interrupt product flow, delay customer deliveries, and reduce supply chain revenues considerably. Prior planning for disruptions could greatly alleviate these consequences. A method to cope with disruptions is to use product substitution in the case of a product shortage. In this research, the supply chain of a livestock-drug distribution company in Iran, facing demand disruptions, has been chosen as a case study. For this purpose, a multi-stage stochastic integer programming model is proposed and solved using a customized progressive hedging algorithm. Moreover, the effect of uncertainty on the supply chain performance is measured using the value of the stochastic solution (VSS) and the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) metrics. Based on the different instances of the problem solved, the VSS metric shows that modeling and solving the proposed stochastic model could enhance the company profit by about 3.27 percent on average. In addition, the EVPI metric demonstrates that planning and investing in proactive demand management could enhance the profit up to 9.42 percent. Finally, analyses indicate that when dealing with increased demand uncertainty levels, the importance of using the proposed method increases as the profitability of the company decreases.","[Khalilabadi, Seyed Mahdi Ghorashi; Zegordi, Seyed Hessameddin; Nikbakhsh, Ehsan] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Ind & Syst Engn, Post Box 14117-13116, Tehran, Iran","Zegordi, SH (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Ind & Syst Engn, Post Box 14117-13116, Tehran, Iran.",m.ghorashi@modares.ac.ir; zegordi@modares.ac.ir; nikbakhsh@modares.ac.ir,,,,,,47,0,0,4,4,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-8352,1879-0550,,COMPUT IND ENG,Comput.

Although blockchain technology has been lauded as a way for firms to build sustainable supply chain networks, the rate of acceptance of this technology remains low. Therefore, this study seeks to identify the factors that discourage firms from merging blockchain with the supply chain. Instead of providing further reasons for adopting blockchain technology, we try to understand what deters firms from adding blockchain to their operations. Following the deductive approach, a confirmatory factor analysis is conducted on pre-test questionnaires to test, improve, and verify the constructs (questions) to measure the hypothesized factors. A theoretical model is proposed based on the hypotheses, and structural equation modeling is applied. The results are estimated using the partial least squares approach and a sample of 83 respondents. Our findings based on our empirical data support most of our hypotheses. We find that various factors impede the adoption of blockchain technologies, including technological barriers, constraints rooted in organizations and the environment, and system-related governmental barriers. In addition, various factors are critical determinants of resistance to blockchain in the technological, organizational, and environmental dimensions.","[Choi, Daeheon; Seyha, Thou] Kookmin Univ, Coll Business Adm, 77 Jeongneung Ro, Seoul 02707, South Korea; [Chung, Chune Young] Chung Ang Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Sch Business Adm, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 06974, South Korea; [Young, Jason] Washington State Univ, Coll Business, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Chung, CY (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Sch Business Adm, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 06974, South Korea.",dhchoi@kookmin.ac.kr; bizfinance@cau.ac.kr; seyhathou@gmail.com; bizfinace@naver.com,,,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of KoreaNational Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2019S1A5A2A01036550],This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2019S1A5A2A01036550).,,119,0,0,5,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2020,12,21,,,,,,,8882,10.3390/su12218882,,,37,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OR3MX,WOS:000589379000001,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

The study attempts a system dynamics modelling approach to explore the implications of greenhouse gas concentration trajectories associated with climate change on bioethanol supply chains. Eight different climate change scenarios are simulated spanning over a 40-year horizon to predict biomass yield and bioethanol availability, by considering first generation (corn) and second generation (switchgrass) ethanol feedstocks. The developed model is used to assess the extent of potential disruptions resulting from global warming. Cascading effect of climate change risk is evident through decreased yield and production, and increased shortages at end customer in the bioethanol supply network. The results indicate that, if climate change risk is not adequately mitigated and current used source of ethanol (corn) continues to be leveraged, the bioethanol availability may decrease by one-fourth by the year 2060. The comparative study encourages exploring the increased use of switchgrass as a sustainable feedstock for renewable energy.

The growing complexity in the design process of microelectronics coupled with the requirement of significant investment in research and development means that there is hardly any entity in the industry that is capable of acquiring the state-of-the-art technologies for all facets of the development process across myriad niche device technologies. Therefore, for economic and practical reasons, the modern electronic supply chain relies on several different vendors that specialize in a specific area of the design and fabrication process. From a security perspective, this distributed manufacturing process violates the trust of the underlying hardware as any entity in the supply chain could maliciously modify the design. This poses a significant concern, especially for government, military applications, and consumer electronic products handling private and critical data during the acquisition of untrusted microelectronic designs and components. Hence, trust has emerged as a crucial constraint that the various steps in the microelectronic manufacturing process should consider in order to ensure that no malicious functionality exists in the hardware. In the last decade, several works have proposed steps both to establish and verify trust in microelectronics. However, not all threat models are adequately covered, and the solutions are pertinent to a limited category of devices. In this article, we present the challenges in establishing trust in today's distributed supply chain environment by discussing the attack models at each step of the manufacturing process. We also shed light on the existing solutions that try to address these threats and discuss their limitations. Finally, we elaborate on one of the existing supply chain standards where trust verification is still infeasible and identify avenues for future research.","[Hoque, Tamzidul; SLPSK, Patanjali] Univ Florida, ECE Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Bhunia, Swarup] Univ Florida, ECE Dept, Internet Things, UF, Gainesville, FL USA","Hoque, T (corresponding author), Univ Florida, ECE Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",thoque@ufl.edu; patanjal.sristil@ufl.edu; swarup@ece.ufl.edu,,,,,,33,1,1,3,3,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2162-2248,2162-2256,,IEEE CONSUM ELECTR M,IEEE Consum.

Nowadays the synchronization of sales essentials and industrial restrictions in an uncertain environment is critical for all global companies facing complexity in supply chain networks and operations systems. Sales and supply chain structures in build-to-order industries generally have cross-functional and conflicting objects that are not easily comparable. The current research is an extension of an innovative S&OP model within a more dynamically complex system in terms of demands uncertainty and unreliability of backup supplies. The promoted model is utilized for more efficient management and integration of industrial restrictions and sales essentials in global supply chain networks in terms of demand and supply coordination and responsiveness toward customers' needs. Accordingly, this research has applied a simulation-based optimization approach to balance the trade-off between logistics cost and customers' experience level as the main objectives. Two classes of strategies are offered for handling parts' replenishment and flexibility to the sales structure. Initially, the proposed model evaluates two main inventory strategies' performances. Thereafter, the optimized values of flexibility degree and safety stock fraction for corresponding inventory strategies are calculated by using a multiobjective simulation-optimization method. The investigation begins with an overall assessment of the system's performance. Furthermore, it details the alterations among the strategies' key performance indicators (KPIs) as system parameters' function.","[Aiassi, Rouzbeh] Univ Tehran, Fac Entrepreneurship, New Business Dept, Tehran, Iran; [Sajadi, Seyed Mojtaba] Univ Tehran, Fac Entrepreneurship, New Business Dept, Farshi Moghadam 16 St,North Kargar Ave, Tehran, Iran; [Hadji-Molana, Seyyed Mohammad] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Fac Engn, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Zamani-Babgohari, Ali] Univ Tehran, Fac Management, Dept Operat Management, Tehran, Iran","Sajadi, SM (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Fac Entrepreneurship, New Business Dept, Farshi Moghadam 16 St,North Kargar Ave, Tehran, Iran.",msajadi@ut.ac.ir; molana@srbiau.ac.ir; zamania@ut.ac.ir,"Babgohari, Ali Zamani/ABD-4127-2020; Sajadi, Seyed Mojtaba/ABD-4069-2020","Babgohari, Ali Zamani/0000-0002-2724-4027; Sajadi, Seyed Mojtaba/0000-0002-2139-2053",,,,87,1,1,10,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1569-190X,1878-1462,,SIMUL MODEL PRACT TH,Simul.

This way, configuring a blood transfusion network to handle the appropriate assignments and distribution is proved to influence the type, number and severity of recent crises. Therefore, obtaining effective solutions, containing determining the optimal location of facilities of field hospitals, identifying the optimal capacity of facilities and transportation, blood transfusion routes to reduce costs and injustices in this area in times of crisis is essential. Hence, in this study, we proposed a model, intend for allocating blood types and regarding the lifetime of blood to tackle with field hospitals in the disaster sites. Furthermore, the coverage of the demand for blood types for the establishment of field hospitals and the balanced distribution of blood between these hospitals from the blood collection level to the establishment of field hospitals with optimal routing of blood transfusion at the lowest cost is considered. The proposed model for the crisis response management phase is modelled applying a multi-objective mathematical model under uncertain conditions. To cope with the uncertain data arisen in the disaster condition, the robust optimization approach is applied. Then, to solve the proposed model, a hybrid method based on Genetic Algorithm and Multi-Choice Goal Programming (GAMCGP) under uncertainty is developed. In addition, the proposed model is successfully applied to a real- world blood supply chain in Mazandaran, northern part of Iran, and the results validate the performance of the proposed model. It also proves that the suggested model can be considered as a new approach for blood supply chain tactical management in the crisis logistics.","[Gholizadeh, Hadi] Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Razavi, Niloufar; Gholizadeh, Hadi] Mazandaran Univ Sci & Technol, Babol, Iran; [Nayeria, Sina] Univ Tehran, Tehran, Iran; [Ashrafi, Tannaz Alizadeh] Arctic Univ Norway, Tromso, Norway","Gholizadeh, H (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Genie Mecan, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",hadi.gh1988@gmail.com,,,,,,39,0,0,12,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-5682,1476-9360,,J OPER RES SOC,J.

This paper aimed at identifying the barriers hindering efficient management of a return channel in this type of retail. Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review procedure was used, including descriptive and content analysis of results. The review was performed using four academic databases. Applicable barriers were categorized thematically, a conceptual framework was proposed and future research avenues were drawn. Findings The contribution of this paper comprises a theoretical description of reverse logistics applied to omnichannel retail, the identification of the return barriers in omnichannel and a conceptual framework for a holistic view of the problem. In all, 43 barriers were identified including high investments, product restocking, additional transportation costs and poor communication. Research limitations/implications The link between reverse logistics and omnichannel area is recent and publications are still scarce, so the newness of this study limits the opportunity for further deepening or more robust validation of the results. Practical implications The results offered may be used by managers in the areas of retail and supply chain management in general in order to reduce the natural complexity in omnichannel environment. Originality/value Regarding previous literature on omnichannel retail, only a few works consider the after-sales stage. This work intended to pave the way in this poorly explored intersection (reverse logistics and omnichannel) by presenting a conceptual framework to classify various barriers in omnichannel retail return.","[de Borba, Jorge Luiz Gayotto; Magalhaes, Mauricio Rodrigues de; Filgueiras, Raquel Stefan; Bouzon, Marina] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Prod & Syst Engn, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil","Bouzon, M (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Prod & Syst Engn, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",Jorgelgborba@gmail.com; mauriciorodm@gmail.com; rstefan.filgueiras@gmail.com; marinabouzon@gmail.com,,,,,,75,0,0,7,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0959-0552,1758-6690,,INT J RETAIL DISTRIB,Int.

To immune the network against disruptions, a new resiliency approach is proposed by extending efficient demand coverage plans. The developed model includes four objectives. The first objective minimizes the total costs of the network along with maximizing the coverage of customers' demand. As a new concept, the second objective maximizes the operational reliability of facilities to extend a consistent and responsive tire supply chain. Also, to design a sustainable network, the third objective function minimizes CO2 emissions in the strategic and tactical planning horizons. Moreover, the fourth objective maximizes the social responsibility of the network via introducing new social factors. A new mixed fuzzy possibilistic flexible programming method is also proposed to handle constraints' violations and parameters' uncertainty.

However, many companies often have problems such as insufficient partner credit, which seriously affects the quality of cooperation. In order to effectively evaluate the credit, this paper constructs a personal credit evaluation model. The model compares the weight adjustment method with BP neural network and other methods. Compared with the BP neural network weight adjustment algorithm, the improved algorithm has obvious advantages in accuracy and convergence speed. The simulation results show that the green supply chain cooperation credit evaluation model can better evaluate the environmental behavior of enterprises. The BP neural network can better solve the problem of slow convergence and premature convergence, and can search data more accurately. The algorithm has good robustness. The evaluation model has high optimization accuracy, which shows that BP neural network can better learn and evaluate the credit of green supply chain at different levels.","[Chen, Jie] Chongqing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Innovat & Entrepreneurship Educ, Chongqing 400065, Peoples R China; [Huang, Shoujun] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Univ Coll, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Huang, SJ (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Univ Coll, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",huangshj29@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,,Major Program of National Social Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [19ZDA082],This work was supported by the Major Program of National Social Science Foundation of China (19ZDA082).,,10,1,1,8,8,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0941-0643,1433-3058,,NEURAL COMPUT APPL,Neural Comput.

Particularly, in terms of agriculture, the rainfall variability causes lower water availability, having unfavorable yield effects in all the crops. Temperature increases and rainfall reduction have resulting decreases in agricultural production and infertility. These issues, combined with the constant population growth, predict a severe food security problem for the next decades. In recent years, natural disasters are more frequent and dangerous as the result of global warming. Droughts, freezing, and flooding are the problems with the highest impact on the food supply chain, particularly in low-income communities, increasing the lack of access to food and undernourished problems, resulting in human casualties. This paper presents a response analysis of the food supply chain network in 14 municipalities of the state of Michoacan in Mexico; these municipalities are the ones with the lowest human development index values, joined to malnutrition problems. Natural disasters such as freezing, flood, and drought were considered and used to measure their impact on the food network through a mathematic optimization model, obtaining food system behavior to these difficulties. In the addressed case study, as a consequence of natural disasters, the total cost of the food network increases fifteen times to obtain a resilient system.

The application of Internet of Things (IoT) technology to the optimization of e-commerce supply chain can help e-commerce enterprises to monitor each product in real time and manage logistics system reasonably; thus, the circulation process of e-commerce product in the supply chain can be monitored and shared, and the product information at each stage of the supply chain can be analyzed and predicted, helping e-commerce companies to estimate the future trends or accident probability. On the analysis of summarizing and analyzing previous works, this article expounded the research status and significance of e-commerce supply chain optimization, elaborated the development background, current status, and future challenges of the IoT technology, introduced the methods and principles of the node distribution model and constraint parameter analysis of logistics supply chain, constructed the IoT-based e-commerce supply chain linear and nonlinear model including competition and risk-control modules, performed the design of IoT-based e-commerce supply chain optimization, and discussed the solutions to procurement robustness optimization and management process optimization. The final simulation analysis showed that the proposed optimization model can effectively predict e-commerce product information in each stage of the supply chain; the IoT-based e-commerce supply chain optimization can enable each node company in the supply chain to improve the quality of information transmission and reduce the risk of information asymmetry in the process of e-commerce exchanges and can quickly and easily respond to the sudden changes of market and environment, thereby promoting them to cooperate with each other for establishing a supply chain network structure with closer business relationships, smoother logistics transportation, more reasonable benefit sharing, and stronger market competitiveness.","[Zhu, Liwei] Guangdong Polytech Sci & Technol, Coll Commerce, Zhuhai 519090, Peoples R China","Zhu, LW (corresponding author), Guangdong Polytech Sci & Technol, Coll Commerce, Zhuhai 519090, Peoples R China.",11630019@zju.edu.cn,,,Guangdong Province Natural Science Fund Project: Construction and Innovation of E-commerce Models by empirical study [S2013010011522]; Zhuhai Science and Technology Project: Research on the Development of Internet of Things industry in Zhuhai [2011B030102006],This work was supported by the Guangdong Province Natural Science Fund Project: Construction and Innovation of E-commerce Models by empirical study (no.

It is necessary to design a sustainable last mile relief network for distributing relief supplies regarding social factors, disaster relief efficiency as well as the economic cost of three perspectives in terms of sustainability. We establish a multi-objective distributionally robust optimization model for a sustainable last mile relief network problem that maximizes the equitable distribution of relief supplies and simultaneously minimizes the transportation time and operation cost. Under the partial probability information of uncertainties, such as the disaster situation, transportation time, freight, road capacity, and demand, we characterize the uncertain variables in an ambiguity set incorporating the bounds, means and the mean absolute deviations. Then, the bounds on the objective values and the safe approximations of the chance constraints are deduced under the ambiguity sets. Based on a revised multi-choice goal programming approach, we obtain a computationally tractable framework of the multi-objective model. To verify the effectiveness of the model and methods, a case study of the Banten tsunami is illustrated. The results demonstrate our proposed model can obtain a trade-off between the equitability, timeliness and economics for relief distribution in a relief network.","[Zhang, Peiyu] Hebei Univ, Coll Math & Informat Sci, Baoding 071002, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yankui; Yang, Guoqing] Hebei Univ, Sch Management, Baoding 071002, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Yang, Guoqing; Zhang, Guoqing] Univ Windsor, Dept Mech Automot & Mat Engn, Windsor, ON, Canada","Yang, GQ (corresponding author), Hebei Univ, Sch Management, Baoding 071002, Hebei, Peoples R China.; Yang, GQ (corresponding author), Univ Windsor, Dept Mech Automot & Mat Engn, Windsor, ON, Canada.",ygq@tju.edu.cn,,"Zhang, Guoqing/0000-0003-0821-8787","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61773150, 71801077]; Top-notch talents of Hebei province [702800118009]; Social Science Foundation of Hebei Province [HB17GL012]; High-Level Innovative Talent Foundation of Hebei University [521000981073]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [RGPIN-2014-03594, RGPIN-2019-07115]","This work are supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61773150 and Grant No. 71801077), the Top-notch talents of Hebei province (Grant No. 702800118009), Social Science Foundation of Hebei Province (HB17GL012), the High-Level Innovative Talent Foundation of Hebei University (Grant No. 521000981073), and Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada discovery grant (Grant No. RGPIN-2014-03594, RGPIN-2019-07115).",,70,0,0,16,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0254-5330,1572-9338,,ANN OPER RES,Ann.

These issues are inevitable and interrelated. The issues produce undesirable cascading effects that make performance measurement complicated. This paper aims to identify and model the critical barriers in the HSC. Design/methodology/approach The study identifies 17 barriers through the relevant literature and interviews with the stakeholders related to humanitarian organization (HO) in the developing economy. The barriers have been identified from strategic, technological, organizational, economic and operational point of view. Further, the barriers were ranked based on the degree of influence using the grey analytic network process (ANP) approach. The interrelationship among the influential barriers is established through modified total interpretive structural modelling (mTISM). To analyse and demonstrate the iterative consensus among the stakeholders, kappa statistics was adopted. Findings The barriers have been ranked to determine their extent of influence and modelled to reveal the interrelationship among them. The issues concerned with skills of personnel are the most influential barrier. Other three critical barriers identified are: chaotic operative environment, conflicting objectives of HO and lack of funding for information technology (IT) infrastructure. Appropriate funds need to be allocated towards IT infrastructure and personnel training. Originality/value Both quantitative and qualitative performance measurement frameworks had been proposed earlier for HSC. However, limited literature addresses the implementation issues with the available frameworks. This study advances the knowledge on performance measurement barriers of HSC and develops a functional description to identify the critical role of performance measurement in HOs. The study proposes a new version of the interpretive structure modelling, using mTISM technique, to determine the contextual interactions between various HSC performance measurement barriers.","[Patil, Anchal; Shardeo, Vipulesh; Madaan, Jitender] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Management Studies, New Delhi, India","Patil, A (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Management Studies, New Delhi, India.",patil.anchal@gmail.com; vipuleshshardeo@gmail.com; jmadaaniitd@gmail.com,"Patil, Anchal/AAW-2114-2020","Patil, Anchal/0000-0002-3279-0161","research committee of Department of Management Studies (DMS), Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IITD)","The authors would also like to thank the kind reviewers and research committee of Department of Management Studies (DMS), Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IITD) for their financial and technical support.",,62,1,1,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1741-0401,1758-6658,,INT J PRODUCT PERFOR,Int.

In response, a growing number of food retailers and manufacturers have committed to reducing N2O emissions from their vast networks of farmer suppliers by providing technical assistance and financial incentives. A key challenge for such companies is demonstrating that their efforts are leading to meaningful progress toward their climate mitigation commitments. We show that a simplified version of soil surface nitrogen (N) balance-or partial N balance-the difference between N inputs to and outputs from a farm field (fertilizer N minus crop N), is a robust indicator of direct N2O emissions from fields with maize and other major rainfed temperate-region crops. Furthermore, we present a generalized environmental model that will allow food-supply-chain companies to translate aggregated and anonymized changes in average N balance across their supplying farms into aggregated changes in N2O emissions. This research is an important first step, based on currently available science, in helping companies demonstrate the impact of their sustainability efforts.","[Eagle, A. J.; McLellan, E.

To this end, uncertainty is assumed in the demand and production data. During the Pandemic COVID-19 period, uncertainty has increased and the food supply chain system has changed. Thus, a new configuration of the food supply network requires analysis. In this paper, the concept of RFH is introduced to connect producers in rural areas and customers in urban areas. This paper determines the location and capacity of RFHs, the food supply network, the sum of maximum food supplies, and minimum logistics cost. This is done via a Multi-Objective Many-to-Many Location-Routing Problem model. Furthermore, since the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain, robust optimization is employed to handle uncertainties. During the current pandemic, red zones are defined to indicate the severity of the pandemic in a region. In this paper, the numerical experiment is considered for three scenarios: when a region is in large scale social distancing, partial social distancing, or normal conditions. This social distancing situation is based on the defined red zones. The optimal food supply network is obtained for the three scenarios and the best scenario among the three is identified.","[Perdana, Tomy] Univ Padjadjaran, Fac Agr, Dept Agro Socioecon, Jl Raya Bandung Sumedang KM 21, Sumedang 45363, West Java Provi, Indonesia; [Chaerani, Diah; Achmad, Audi Luqmanul Hakim] Univ Padjadjaran, Dept Math, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Sumedang, West Java Provi, Indonesia; [Hermiatin, Fernianda Rahayu] Univ Padjadjaran, Agr Logist & Supply Chain Syst AGRILOGICS, Sumedang, West Java Provi, Indonesia","Perdana, T (corresponding author), Univ Padjadjaran, Fac Agr, Dept Agro Socioecon, Jl Raya Bandung Sumedang KM 21, Sumedang 45363, West Java Provi, Indonesia.",tomy.perdana@impad.ac.id,,"Achmad, Audi/0000-0001-5597-779X; Perdana, Tomy/0000-0003-0470-979X",Indonesian The Ministry of Research and Technology/National Research and Innovation Agency [1827/UN6.3.1/LT/2020],This research was funded by Indonesian The Ministry of Research and Technology/National Research and Innovation Agency (1827/UN6.3.1/LT/2020).,,83,0,0,5,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2405-8440,,,HELIYON,Heliyon,OCT,2020,6,10,,,,,,,e05128,10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05128,,,22,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,OK1DQ,WOS:000584392300072,33020743,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2021-03-04

Meanwhile ASC is a good example of a strategy drawing heavily on digitization since as a demand chain management it was information-centric and technology-centric from its inception. Yet, despite this relationship, a lack of coherence and clarity around the input of technology for ASC has impeded to portray accurately the relative importance of digitization in ASC strategies. This study provides a comprehensive and integrative review of 90 articles on ASC. By so doing, we contribute to the discussion about digitization in the supply chain in several ways. First, the paper reports descriptively and analytically how technology was addressed within the ASC literature. Second, it maps a nomological network of ASC research. Third, it finds that technology appears as a necessary but not-sufficient enabling factor for ASC deployment.

A recent trend has been observed regarding the implementation of strategies like Lean, Agile, Resilient and Green (LARG) in combination to attain fruitful results. However, this combination carries a complication regarding its understanding and implementation and a gap observed regarding the availability of literature study that can cope all these strategies on one platform for understanding and can suggest a proper implementation method. It has been observed that there are some new models that are utilizing electronic configurations to provide powerful platform for process improvements. Utilization of LARG as tool or technique in combination of technologies can be very effective for process improvements. Therefore, this current work emphasis on the combining of LARG along with wireless technologies for obtaining a sustainable improvement in manufacturing sector, which seems unavailable. Based on this ideology, the aim of this research is to conduct a systematic literature study that reviews the previously available LARG research with the objectives to first study the LARG combination for understanding and to develop the interrelation between LARG and previous available technologies for its successful implementation. The literature study results that the LARG combination has many benefits like helpful to attain elimination of non-value activities (lean), responsive to the changing demands of customers as per increasing volatile market (agile), responsive to the unexpected disruptions (resilient) and to adopt environmental protection (green) but typically lacks its utilization with modern technologies (Like RFID) that will be helpful to attain successful implementation. The contribution of this study is the next generation in LARG implementation to emphasis more on the combining of LARG implemetation with utilization of modern technologies.","[Rafique, Muhammad Zeeshan; Qureshi, Hamid Iftikhar; Malkana, Muhammad Umar; Haider, Syed Mustafa; Atif, Muhammad] Univ Lahore, Dept Mech Engn, Lahore, Pakistan","Rafique, MZ (corresponding author), Univ Lahore, Dept Mech Engn, Lahore, Pakistan.",muhammadzeeshanrafique@gmail.com; hamid.iftikhar@me.uol.edu.pk; umalkana41@gmail.com; mustafahaider786@gmail.com; muhammad.atif1@me.uol.edu.pk,"Rafique, Muhammad Zeeshan/AAD-8712-2019","Rafique, Muhammad Zeeshan/0000-0003-4259-0312",,,,67,0,0,1,1,MEHRAN UNIV ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY,JAMSHORO,"C/O MS MUMTAZ S MEMON, LIBRARIAN, JAMSHORO, 00000, PAKISTAN",0254-7821,2413-7219,,MEHRAN UNIV RES J EN,Mehran Univ.

Moreover, it is important for retailers to quickly recover from these events by replenishing the stock of essential supplies to meet the continuing needs of local residents. The main purpose of this research is to study consumer precautionary stockpiling behavior prior to the onset of hurricane landfalls and determine the impact of this behavior on in-store product availability for various formats of retail store outlets. Specifically, we focus on the bottled water product category, an essential emergency category in hurricane preparedness. This study combines an event analysis methodology with econometric models using archival retail scanner data from 60 US retail chains located in 963 counties and real-time data from four recent US continental hurricanes. We find that supply-side characteristics (retail network and product variety), demand-side characteristics (hurricane experience and household income), and disaster characteristics (hazard proximity and hazard intensity) significantly affect consumer stockpiling propensity as the hurricanes approach. The increased consumer stockpiling has immediate and longer-term impacts on retail operations, namely, in-store product availability. Among various retail formats, drug stores are associated with the highest consumer stockpiling propensity before hurricanes, while dollar stores and discount stores are associated with the lowest in-store product availability following hurricanes. Our study points to the need for retailers and policymakers to carefully monitor factors affecting consumer stockpiling behavior that will allow for better allocation of critical supplies during the hurricane season.","[Pan, Xiaodan] Concordia Univ, John Molson Sch Business, Montreal, PQ H3H 0A1, Canada; [Dresner, Martin] Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Mantin, Benny] Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg Ctr Logist & Supply Chain Management, L-1359 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Zhang, Jun A.] Univ Miami, NOAAs Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Hurricane Res Div, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Zhang, Jun A.] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33149 USA","Pan, XD (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, John Molson Sch Business, Montreal, PQ H3H 0A1, Canada.",xiaodan.pan@concordia.ca; mdresner@rhsmith.umd.edu; benny.mantin@uni.lu; jun.zhang@noaa.gov,"Zhang, Jun A/F-9580-2012","Zhang, Jun A/0000-0003-3713-0223; Mantin, Benny/0000-0002-5206-7851",,,,74,1,1,12,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1059-1478,1937-5956,,PROD OPER MANAG,Prod.

This paper presents a new DEA model for ranking DMUs (suppliers) based on a modification of context-dependent DEA models. Using the concept of attractiveness and progress for each supplier, this paper suggests a new DEA ranking approach. The proposed method is able to rank all efficient and inefficient suppliers. A case study demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed method. Our proposed method is used to determine the most sustainable suppliers of Sazeh Gostare Saipa Company.

Increasing supply chain complexity (SCC) is argued as one of the biggest risks in achieving the organisational goal with an adverse impact on operational efficiency, cost, profitability, on-time delivery, and customer satisfaction. Though drivers of SSC and SCC have seemingly demonstrated mutual relationship in a practical scenario, supply chain managers tend to address respective drivers independently for managing and controlling. Limited availability of literature investigating interactions among drivers of SSC and SCC with its overall impact on the supply chain motivates deeper research. To address the gap, current research aims to study the mutual relationship between SSC and SCC drivers. To achieve this, a combination of sequential exploratory two-phased research methodology is adopted. The Delphi technique is initially applied to identify the critical SSC and SCC drivers followed by using interpretive structural modeling (ISM) to decipher the mutual relationship among the SSC and SCC drivers. The interactions between SSC and SCC drivers explored in this work will provide supply chain managers a framework for informed decision making. The driving and dependence power of drivers can guide SC practitioners to prioritize and focus on key drivers with a high impact on the overall outcome. The organization can also be benefitted by managing SSC and SCC drivers in synergy against the silo approach. The research finding suggests that market uncertainty, institutional regulations, strategic supplier collaboration, customer pressure, and new technologies are key five drivers in decision-making.","[Chand, Pushpendu; Ghosh, Kunal Kanti] Indian Inst Technol IIT, Vinod Gupta Sch Management, Kharagpur, W Bengal, India; [Thakkar, Jitesh J.] Indian Inst Technol IIT, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Kharagpur, W Bengal, India","Chand, P (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol IIT, Vinod Gupta Sch Management, Kharagpur, W Bengal, India.",pushpendu.chand@gmail.com; jt@iem.iitkgp.ernet.in; kunal@vgsom.iitkgp.ernet.in,,,,,,108,2,2,7,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4207,1873-7641,,RESOUR POLICY,Resour.

Therefore, companies are increasingly aligning their supply chain with business goals due to their impact on the firm's performance. Researchers acknowledge the importance of managing supply chain performance (SCP) in achieving greater customer experience and retention, increased cost-competitiveness, gaining market share with faster product innovation. Hence measuring and managing SCP is critical for a firm's business success. Though existing literature has explored key performance indicators (KPI) in measuring SCP but has rarely studied the interactions among the key SCP metrics and subsequent impact of overall SCP. To address the gap, present research work aimed to identify key metrics, rank them, investigate mutual relationship and propose integrated SCP metrics. Understanding the interrelationship among SCP metrics will enable supply chain practitioners in well-aligned decision making. To achieve this, a hybrid exploratory three-phased multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) model is adopted. The qualitative Delphi technique is initially applied to identify the critical SCP metrics, followed by Best-Worst Method (BWM) to rank SCP metrics, completed by decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method to establish the mutual relationship among the SCP metrics. The research finding, based on the study conducted for mining and earth-moving machinery manufacturing industry, suggests that sub-metrics such as flexibility in meeting customer needs, customer perceived value, operating cost of SC, employee productivity, range of products and services, are significantly contributing to the overall SCP.

With the rise of global supply chain network, the choice of supply chain orientation is critical. This study argues that performance differences between these configurations highlight managerial implications for sustainable development. Design/methodology/approach Drawing from uncertainty reduction and cognitive social capital theories, this study developed a taxonomy of manufacturing firms based on process alignment between cultural compatibility and supply chain communication. The empirical data used in this study were drawn from the Global Manufacturing Research Group (GMRG) survey project, with data collected from 680 manufacturing companies, across various industry sectors and countries. Findings There appeared to be consistent three major configurations: the Proactive, the Initiative and the Reactive. Manufacturers distanced themselves based mainly on communication with customers on events and proprietary information. Communication-cultural compatibility taxonomies influence differently on operations and financial performance. The Initiative, who excelled in communication practices gained significant improvement in efficiency and delivery measures. While Reactive lagged, Proactive aligned in both capabilities to experience higher payoffs in operational and financial measures. The findings offer a step-by-step approach where manufacturers intensify communication with partners for better efficiency and delivery measures, then align cultural practices to obtain financial, quality and innovation performance. Research limitations/implications It will be fruitful for future research to examine the evolution of longitudinally. A comparison between developed and developing economies will be of interest. Practical implications The findings provide a step-by-step decision-making process for supply chain communication and offer guidance especially for global supply chain managers. Originality/value This study adds greater comprehensiveness and richness to the information exchange literature on performance by process aligning to enhance cultural compatibility.","[Nguyen, Hung] RMIT Univ Vietnam, Shool Business & Management, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Onofrei, George] Letterkenny Inst Technol, Business, Letterkenny, Ireland; [Truong, Dothang] Embry Riddle Aeronaut Univ, Coll Aviat, Daytona Beach, FL USA","Nguyen, H (corresponding author), RMIT Univ Vietnam, Shool Business & Management, Hanoi, Vietnam.",hung.nguyen@rmit.edu.vn; george.onofrei@lyit.ie; TRUONGD@erau.edu,"Onofrei, George/AAF-1809-2019","Onofrei, George/0000-0003-3508-370X; Nguyen, Hung/0000-0001-9401-2819",RMIT University Vietnam,The work described in this paper was fully supported by a research grant from the RMIT University Vietnam.,,77,0,0,8,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-7154,1758-4116,,BUS PROCESS MANAG J,Bus.

Both single-machine environment and identical parallel-machine environment are considered in the production part. The jobs finished on the machines are delivered to the same customer in batches. Each delivery batch has a capacity and incurs a delivery cost. There is a situation that a possible disruption in the production part may occur at some particular time and will last for a period of time with a probability. We consider both resumable case and nonresumable case where a job does not need (needs) to restart if it is disrupted for a resumable (nonresumable) case. The objective is to find a coordinated schedule of production and delivery that minimizes the expected total flow times plus the delivery costs. We first present some properties and analyze the NP-hard complexity for four various problems. For the corresponding single-machine and parallel-machine scheduling problems, pseudo-polynomial-time algorithms and fully polynomial-time approximation schemes (FPTASs) are presented in this paper, respectively.","[Gong, Hua; Zhang, Yuyan; Yuan, Puyu] Shenyang Ligong Univ, Coll Sci, Shenyang 110159, Peoples R China; [Gong, Hua] Northeastern Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Data Analyt & Optimizat Smart Ind, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China","Gong, H; Yuan, PY (corresponding author), Shenyang Ligong Univ, Coll Sci, Shenyang 110159, Peoples R China.; Gong, H (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Data Analyt & Optimizat Smart Ind, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China.",gonghua@sylu.edu.cn; 452983100@qq.com,,,"Project of Liaoning BaiQianWan Talents Program [LR201945-22]; Science and Technology Project of Educational Department of Liaoning Province [LG201912]; Major International Joint Research Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71520107004]; 111 ProjectMinistry of Education, China - 111 Project [B16009]","This research was partly supported by the Project of Liaoning BaiQianWan Talents Program (grant no.

To supplement the previous qualitative assessment of the plan and to potentially justify continuing with its implementation, this paper aims to evaluate the prospective long-term performance of the planned RDCs within a hub-and-spoke (HS) network. The chosen methodology for this analysis is a hybrid of optimization and simulation, using an agent-based modeling and simulation platform that incorporates a geographic information system (GIS) element to provide a realistic geographical context. This constitutes a relatively novel innovation in logistics research. Experiments were developed to estimate the logistics performance of the hub-and-spoke network and planned RDCs, as well as to identify potential problems such as bottlenecks at the RDCs and the relative (in)efficiency of the selected multimodal transport. Transport costs, inventory costs, and the order backlog of RDCs are evaluated based on the average results from 100 replications. Outcomes from the model are validated against empirical data on Indonesia's logistics costs from the World Bank. Model results indicate that the hub-and-spoke network performs better than the point-to-point network when it comes to transportation costs. Since this is found to be the dominant element of total logistics costs, appropriate modal choice and route optimization are, therefore, critical to reducing logistics costs. The planned RDCs are found to have significant imbalance in their loadings, which is likely to produce bottlenecks. The paper concludes that a planned move to a hub-and spoke system is appropriate and that the planned investment in the RDCs is therefore justified. However, there is a need to streamline the predicted loadings at the RDCs to avoid bottlenecks. Our results suggest that the government should reopen the case and reevaluate the locations and coverage of each RDC. More generically, it is concluded that the application of hybrid optimization and simulation using agent-based modeling and simulation is feasible and the methodological approach adopted herein is generalizable to other archipelagic logistics systems.","[Sopha, Bertha Maya; Sakti, Sekar; Dwiansarinopa, Marselina Winda] Univ Gadjah Mada, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; [Prasetia, Ari Carisza Graha] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Ind & Informat Management, Tainan, Taiwan; [Cullinane, Kevin] Univ Gothenburg, Sch Business Econ & Law, Gothenburg, Sweden","Sopha, BM (corresponding author), Univ Gadjah Mada, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.",bertha_sopha@ugm.ac.id,,,Indonesian Ministry of Research and Technology/National Agency for Research and Innovation; Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture under the World Class University Program,"This research is partially funded by the Indonesian Ministry of Research and Technology/National Agency for Research and Innovation and the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture under the World Class University Program, managed by Institut Teknologi Bandung.

However, many uncertain factors in the market make this issue a huge challenge. Especially during the current COVID-19 outbreak, the shortage of certain types of medical consumables has become a global problem. The intermittent demand forecast of medical consumables with a short life cycle brings some new challenges, such as the demand occurring randomly in many time periods with zero demand. In this research, a seasonal adjustment method is introduced to deal with seasonal influences, and a dynamic neural network model with optimized model selection procedure and an appropriate model selection criterion are introduced as the main forecasting models. In addition, in order to reduce the impact of zero demand, it adds some input nodes to the neural network by preprocessing the original input data. Lastly, a modified error measurement method is proposed for performance evaluation. Experimental results show that the proposed forecasting framework is superior to other intermittent demand models.","[Liu, Peipei] Harbin Inst Technol, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Liu, Peipei] Ctr Assessment & Dev Res Real Estate, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Liu, Peipei] Dev Res Ctr Real Estate & Urban Construct, Shenzhen 518031, Peoples R China","Liu, PP (corresponding author), Dev Res Ctr Real Estate & Urban Construct, Shenzhen 518031, Peoples R China.",peipl@alumni.hust.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71531009],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71531009).",,52,0,0,12,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1460-4582,1741-2811,,HEALTH INFORM J,Health Inform.

The research involves seven medical device companies located in the Tehran Province, Iran. Design/methodology/approach To identify and prioritize companies based on CSFs of RL, the study proposes a three-phase decision-making framework that integrates the Delphi method, the best-worst method (BWM) and the Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS) method with Z-numbers. The weights required for this method are obtained by a variant of the BWM based on Z-numbers, denoted as Z-numbers Best-Worst Method, or ZBWM. Since decision-makers face an uncertain environment, Z-numbers, which are a kind of fuzzy numbers, are applied. Findings First, after customizing CSFs by the Delphi method and obtaining 15 CSFs of RL, these are ranked by the hybrid BWM-ARAS method with Z-numbers. Results reveal which company appears to perform best with respect to their RL implementations. Based on this result, healthcare device companies should choose the highest priority company based on the selected RL CSFs and results from using the BWM-ARAS method with Z-numbers. Originality/value The contribution of this paper is using a hybrid ARAS-BWM method based on Z-numbers. Each of these methods has some merits compared to other similar methods. The combination of these methods contributes a new approach for prioritizing companies based on RL CSFs with high accuracy and reliability.","[Karbassi Yazdi, Amir] Islamic Azad Univ, South Tehran Branch, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Tehran, Iran; [Wanke, Peter Fernandes] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, COPPEA Grad Sch Business Adm, Ctr Logist Studies, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Hanne, Thomas] Univ Appl Sci & Arts Northwestern Switzerland, Inst Informat Syst, Olten, Switzerland; [Bottani, Eleonora] Univ Parma, Dept Engn & Architecture, Parma, Italy","Hanne, T (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci & Arts Northwestern Switzerland, Inst Informat Syst, Olten, Switzerland.",st_a_karbassiyazdi@azad.ac.ir; thomas.hanne@fhnw.ch; eleonora.bottani@unipr.it,"Bottani, Eleonora/F-9285-2012; Karbassi Yazdi, Amir/D-3834-2016","Bottani, Eleonora/0000-0002-6319-8080; Karbassi Yazdi, Amir/0000-0001-9436-5833",,,,69,0,0,6,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1741-0398,1758-7409,,J ENTERP INF MANAG,J.

Such decisions are difficult in this environment as managers encounter uncertainty and risks. The study investigates establishing or moving distribution facilities in the global supply chain by considering costs, fulfilment, trade uncertainties, risks under environmental trade-offs and disruptive technologies. Design/methodology/approach - This paper combines the possibilities and probabilistic scenarios for a supply chain network by proposing the novel Robust Optimisation and Mixed Integer Linear Programming (ROMILP) method developed under the potential uncertainty of demand while considering the costs associated with a four-tier supply chain network. ROMILP has been solved in a real-time logistics environment by applying a case study approach. Findings - The solution is obtained using an exact solution approach and provides optimality in all tested market scenarios along the proposed global logistics corridor. A sensitivity analysis examines potential facility location scenarios in a global supply chain context. Research limitations/implications - Logistics managers can apply the ROMILP model to test the cost-benefit trade-offs against their facility location and relocation decisions while operating under uncertainty. Future research is proposed to extend the literature by applying data from the OBOR logistics corridor. Originality/value - This study is the first to examine sustainable dimensions along the global logistics corridor and investigate the global container traffic perspective. The study also adds value to the Middle East logistics corridor regarding facility location decisions.","[Sundarakani, Balan] Univ Wollongong Dubai, Fac Business & Management, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Pereira, Vijay] Khalifa Univ Sci & Technol, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Ishizaka, Alessio] NEOMA Business Sch Campus Reims, Reims, France","Sundarakani, B (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong Dubai, Fac Business & Management, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.",balansundarakani@uowdubai.ac.ae; vijay.pereira@kustar.ac.ae; alessio.ishizaka@neoma-bs.fr,"Sundarakani, Balan/C-2368-2019","Sundarakani, Balan/0000-0002-3510-8746",University of Wollongong in Dubai,"The authors would like to acknowledge the comments provided by three anonymous (double blind) reviewers, whose comments enhanced the quality of this paper.

This paper developed a mixed-integer linear programing (MILP) model to incorporate economical and environmental data for multi-objective optimization of the SSC network. Design/methodology/approach The overall objective of the present study is to use high-quality raw materials, at the same time the lowest amount of pollution emission and the highest profitability is achieved. The model in the problem is solved using two algorithms, namely, multi-objective genetic and multi-objective particle swarm. In this research, to integrate sustainable supplier selection and optimization of sustainability performance indicators in supply chain network design considering minimization of cost and time and maximization of sustainability indexes of the system. Findings The differences found between the genetic algorithms (GAs) and the MILP approaches can be explained by handling the constraints and their various logics. The solutions are contrasted with the original crisp model based on either MILP or GA, offering more robustness to the proposed approach. Practical implications The model is applied to Mega Motor company to optimize the sustainability performance of the supply chain i.e. economic (cost), social (time) and environmental (pollution of raw material). The research method has two approaches, namely, applied and mathematical modeling. Originality/value There is limited research designing and optimizing the SSC network.

A model of the hydrogen supply chain (HSC) based on MILP formulation (mixed integer linear programming) in a multi-objective, multi-period formulation, implemented via the s-constraint method to generate the Pareto front, was conducted in a previous work and applied to the Occitania region of France. Three objective functions have been considered, i.e., the levelized hydrogen cost, the global warming potential, and a safety risk index. However, the size of the problem mainly induced by the number of binary variables often leads to difficulties in problem solution. The first innovative part of this work explores the potential of genetic algorithms (GAs) via a variant of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to manage multi-objective formulation to produce compromise solutions automatically. The values of the objective functions obtained by the GAs in the mono-objective formulation exhibit the same order of magnitude as those obtained with MILP, and the multi-objective GA yields a Pareto front of better quality with well-distributed compromise solutions. The differences observed between the GA and the MILP approaches can be explained by way of managing the constraints and their different logics. The second innovative contribution is the modelling of demand uncertainty using fuzzy concepts for HSC design. The solutions are compared with the original crisp models based on either MILP or GA, giving more robustness to the proposed approach. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

With the changing profile of the global disease burden and a broadening concept of emergency health needs to include chronic illness and disability, the aid sector has committed through the World Humanitarian Summit and the Sustainable Development Goals to leave no one behind and thus to meet the health needs of these previously excluded and highly vulnerable people. The civil war in Yemen compromised the medical supply chain supporting the health facilities providing dialysis for patients with end-stage renal disease. The article will critique the aid sector's slow response to this issue and expose the gap between principles, commitments, and practice related to noncommunicable disease in emergencies. Method Following direct experiences from the authors as leaders in the aid response in Yemen, reviews of grey literature from aid and health actors in Yemen were conducted along with a review of literature and policy documents related to noncommunicable disease in emergency. Key informant interviews and press statements supported analysis and events that took place in the time span of roughly 4 years that frames this period of analysis. Results Examination of the impacted patient population, interviews, literature and documented events indicates that there is discord between policy, commitments stated by aid donors and practice. Conclusion The aid sector must use a more contextualised approach when designing programmes to manage the burden of non-communicable diseases in health contexts where crises occur, particularly for lifesaving forms of therapy. Aid agencies and the global health community must increase pressure on donors and implementing agencies to live up to their commitments to include these patient populations.","[Perache, Andre Heller; van Leeuwen, Crystal; Fall, Chiara] Medecins Sans Frontieres, 910 SE 37th Ave Apt 201, Portland, OR 97214 USA","Perache, AH (corresponding author), Medecins Sans Frontieres, 910 SE 37th Ave Apt 201, Portland, OR 97214 USA.",andre.heller.perache@gmail.com,,,,,,19,1,1,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1741-3842,1741-3850,,J PUBLIC HEALTH-UK,J.

Such networks are primarily designed to overcome carbon footprints and to retrieve end of life products from customers. This study considers a multi echelon closed-loop supply chain in the presence of machine disruption. A multi-objective model is presented to optimize the total cost, the total time and emissions in a closed-loop supply chain network. The aim is to analyze the trade-off between the objectives of cost, time, and emissions and how these decisions are impacted by the selection of different available machines. A number of solution approaches are tested on a case study from the tire industry. The results suggest the improved performance of the hybrid heuristic and the importance of controlling disruption in a closed-loop supply chain network. Furthermore, there is a trade-off between the different objective functions which can help the decision maker to choose a particular solution according to the preference of an organization.

The closed-loop supply chain networks (CLSCN) include the returns processes and the producers aim to capturing additional value considering further integration of all supply chain activities. Therefore, all return processes need to be optimized as well as considering environmental impacts leading to form a closed-loop green supply chain network (CLGSCN). For decision making purposes, operational and tactical decision making levels are integrated to configure a coordinated supply chain network aiming to maximize profit while keeping environmental-friendly policies. The case is more sophisticated in melting industries where the collection and categorization in return process and different environmental challenges should be considered at the same time. Thus, in this paper, a CLGSCN of a melting industry is modeled with respect to environmental hazards to optimiza overall profits. Since real-world demand in melting industry under study is uncertain, the robust optimization has been employed, and while the optimization of the proposed mathematical model is time consuming, an improved version of the genetic algorithm has been implemented as a solution method. This study has been carried out at Melting Imen Tabarestan (MIT) company in Iran. The proposed model along with the solution method are investigated in the case study. The results imply the effectiveness and applicability of the model and provide tactical considerations for the managers and practitioners.","[Gholizadeh, Hadi] Mazandaran Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Babol, Iran; [Fazlollahtabar, Hamed] Damghan Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Damghan, Iran","Gholizadeh, H (corresponding author), Mazandaran Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Babol, Iran.",Hadi.gh1988@gmail.com; hfazl@du.ac.ir,"Fazlollahtabar, Hamed/F-1004-2016","Fazlollahtabar, Hamed/0000-0003-3053-4399",,,,33,2,2,16,16,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-8352,1879-0550,,COMPUT IND ENG,Comput.

Qualitative in-depth interview data were collected from senior industry informants within 10 businesses, spanning multiple supply chain tiers. Industry practices are systematically decomposed into product, process and supply chain levels to analyse supply chain sustainability. Findings reveal that product-level practices focused on raw materials more than design initiatives, with operational benefits of cost reduction and market benefits of consumer value-add. Process-level practices in water and energy reduction were motivated by cost reduction benefits more than environmental concerns. At supply chain level, traceability projects and supplier audits were limited by a lack of end-to-end supply chain visibility, despite the criticality of raw materials and evidence of close and long-term trading relationships. Supply chain transparency and supplier engagement are critical areas for development. Both technical and relational resources must be developed across supply networks. Current practices are geared towards reducing negative impacts associated with current operations, falling short of the radical strategies needed to address root causes and embrace sustainability at large.","[Karaosman, Hakan; Brun, Alessandro] Politecn Milan, Milan, Italy; [Perry, Patsy] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Morales-Alonso, Gustavo] Univ Politecn Madrid, Madrid, Spain","Karaosman, H (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Milan, Italy.",hakan.karaosman@polimi.it,"brun, alessandro/A-4601-2012","brun, alessandro/0000-0002-3543-017X; Karaosman, Hakan/0000-0003-4467-5993; Perry, Patsy/0000-0002-8427-9912","European Commission's Education, Audio-visual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) under Erasmus Mundus Action 1 programsEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre; Consejo Social de la Universidad Politecnica de Madrid","This research was conducted within the framework of the European Doctorate in Industrial Management (EDIM) funded by the European Commission's Education, Audio-visual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) under Erasmus Mundus Action 1 programs.

The focus has been given to maximize the economic performance, resource utilization and sustainability through incorporating a holistic decision-making on both forward and reverse logistics. In this paper, a new fuzzy-stochastic multi-objective mathematical model is formulated for sustainable CLSCND. The model aims at balancing the trade-off between cost effectiveness and environmental performance under different types of uncertainty. The environmental performance of CLSCND is measured by carbon emission. Moreover, the network flexibility is modeled and incorporated in the decision-making so that customer demands can be fulfilled by different means. In order to solve the complex optimization problem, the model is first defuzzilized and converted into an equivalent crisp form. Then, a sample average approximation based weighting method (SAAWM) is developed to obtain a set of Pareto optimal solutions between cost and carbon emission under different uncertain environments. The model is validated through a set of numerical experiments. The computational results show, through the incorporation with network flexibility, the proposed mathematical model and solution approach can effectively generate consistent objective values and solutions over different scenario trees and obtain robust strategic decisions on facility locations. Meanwhile, the flexibility and rationality of the decision-making on transportation management, demand allocation and facility operations can be improved as well. (c) 2020 The Authors.

Firms strive to manage risk, handle unexpected disruptions and improve performance in ever changing uncertain business environments. This paper builds upon the information processing view of risk management and explores the association between supply chain integration (SCI) and supply chain risk management (SCRM) to improve operational performance. Subsequently, the mediating role played by SCRM between SCI and firms' operational performance is examined. In this paper, covariance-based structural equation modeling is applied to test the developed hypotheses using data of 931 manufacturing companies obtained from the sixth version of International Manufacturing Strategy Survey (IMSS VI). The findings of the study suggest that internal, supplier and customer integration positively effects SCRM whereas the impact of internal integration is also partially mediated by supplier and customer integration. Additionally, the results present that SCRM partially mediates the relationship between internal integration and operational performance and fully mediates the association between supplier and customer integration and operational performance. This paper contributes to research by proposing and empirically testing a holistic framework demonstrating the effects of SCI on SCRM, and consequently on performance outcomes to develop theoretical and managerial implications.","[Munir, Manal; Jajja, Muhammad Shakeel Sadiq] Lahore Univ Management Sci, Suleman Dawood Sch Business, Lahore, Pakistan; [Chatha, Kamran Ali] Abu Dhabi Univ, Coll Business, POB 1790, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Farooq, Sami] Aalborg Univ, Ctr Ind Prod, Fibigerstr 16, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark","Farooq, S (corresponding author), Aalborg Univ, Ctr Ind Prod, Fibigerstr 16, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark.",sami@business.aau.dk,,,,,,125,7,7,33,54,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-5273,1873-7579,,INT J PROD ECON,Int.

Low water depth has a major impact on the loading capacity of inland ships, and as a consequence on the transport capacity of the overall waterborne supply chain. Individual ship owners have detailed knowledge on how much the draught of their ship and the associated cargo weight should be reduced to adapt to low water. These parameters are even adjusted as a function of environmental circumstances (e.g. composition of the riverbed) and type of cargo. This detailed knowledge is, however, not accessible at an aggregated level to assess the effects on the overall transport capacity of an inland waterway transport network. Based on a range of field observations and information collected from individual ships, this article introduces a general model to define the effect of low water constraints on the deadweight and payload of inland ships, for which only the type, length, and beam of the vessel serve as mandatory input. Availability of a general model of the capacity reducing effect of lowered water depth is important for the design and operation of robust transport chains on the one hand, and for the optimisation of fairway maintenance and long-term infrastructure development on the other.","[van Dorsser, Cornelis; Vinke, Frederik; van Koningsveld, Mark] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands; [van Dorsser, Cornelis] Royal BLN Schuttevaer, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands; [van Dorsser, Cornelis] Trends & Transport, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands; [Vinke, Frederik] Rijkswaterstaat, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands; [Hekkenberg, Robert] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Mech Maritime & Mat Engn, Mekelweg 2, NL-2628 CD Delft, Netherlands; [van Koningsveld, Mark] Van Oord, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CD Delft, Netherlands","van Dorsser, C (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands.; van Dorsser, C (corresponding author), Royal BLN Schuttevaer, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands.; van Dorsser, C (corresponding author), Trends & Transport, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands.",j.c.m.vandorsser@tudelft.nl; f.r.s.vinke@tudelft.nl; r.g.hekkenberg@tudelft.nl; m.vankoningsveld@tudelft.nl,"van Koningsveld, Mark/B-4204-2013","van Koningsveld, Mark/0000-0001-6161-9681",,,,22,0,0,0,0,EDITORIAL BOARD EJTIR,JAFFALAAN 5,"SECTION TRANSPORT POLICY-TLO, JAFFALAAN 5, JAFFALAAN 5, 2628 BX, NETHERLANDS",1567-7133,1567-7141,,EUR J TRANSP INFRAST,Eur.

Therefore, the level at which organisations self-organise, network and adapt to the dynamic operational environment may be related to inter-organisational coordination. The authors studied self-organisation, organisational networks and adaptability as important and often overlooked organisational factors hypothesised to be related to inter-organisational coordination in the context of humanitarian organisations. Design/methodology/approach The study's sample consisted of 101 humanitarian organisations with 315 respondents. To decrease the problem of common method variance, the authors split the samples within each humanitarian organisation into two subsamples: one subsample was used for the measurement of self-organisation, organisational network and adaptability, while the other was for the measurement of inter-organisational coordination. Findings The partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) analysis using SmartPLS 3.2.8 indicated that self-organisation is related to inter-organisational coordination. Organisational network and adaptability were found to be mediators for the relationship between self-organisation and inter-organisational coordination and all combined accounted for 57.8% variance in inter-organisational coordination. Research limitations/implications The study was cross sectional, hence imposing a limitation on changes in perceptions over time. Perhaps, a longitudinal study in future is desirable. Data were collected only from humanitarian organisations that had delivered relief to refugees in the stated camps by 2018. Above all, this study considered self-organisation, adaptability and organisational networks in the explanation of inter-organisational coordination, although there are other factors that could still be explored. Practical implications A potential implication is that humanitarian organisations which need to coordinate with others in emergency situations may need to examine their ability to self-organise, network and adapt. Social implications Social transformation is a function of active social entities that cannot work in isolation. Hence, for each to be able to make a contribution to meaningful social change, there is need to develop organisational networks with sister organisations so as to secure rare resources that facilitate change efforts coupled with the ability to reorganise themselves and adapt to changing environmental circumstances. Originality/value The paper examines (1) the extent to which self-organisation, adaptability and organisational networks influence inter-organisational coordination; (2) the mediating role of both adaptability and organisational networks between self-organisation and inter-organisational coordination in the context of humanitarian organisations against the backdrop of complex adaptive system (CAS) theory.","[Mutebi, Henry; Ntayi, Joseph Mpeera; Muhwezi, Moses] Makerere Univ, Business Sch, Fac Econ Energy & Management Sci FEEMS, Dept Procurement & Logist Management, Kampala, Uganda; [Munene, John C.

Thus, implementation of appropriate recycling or disposal practices has emerged as the critical challenge for the industries aiming to improve their environmental sustainability while satisfy the customers' needs and maintain the economic benefits. In this study, a multi-level closed-loop supply chain network is developed under deterministic and uncertain conditions to maximize the time delivery, and minimize total costs, and environmental impacts under the uncertainty of some parameters. A three-objective mixed integer linear programming model is proposed. The delivery time of purchased materials from suppliers to the manufacturing plants is maximized using the first objective function. The network overall profitability is maximized using the second objective function, and the negative environmental impacts are minimized using the third objective function. Furthermore, to overcome the innate uncertainty of the models' parameters, the Soyster and Mulvey approaches are applied. The developed model is implemented in a case study of a Tire Company. The results revealed the efficiency of on-time delivery considerations on the selection of internal and external suppliers. Applying the VIKOR method demonstrated the better performance of Soyster method compare to the Mulvey method. The results highlighted the performance of the proposed model in which the decision makers were enabled to decide among different types of suppliers (internal and external) based on the time delivery, total cost, and environmental impact.

However, across country contexts, these programs often fall far short of their transformative potential. It is vital, then, to identify policies and organizing strategies that enable school lunch programs to be redesigned at the national scale. In this article, we use document analysis of historical newspapers and government data to examine the motivating factors and underlying conditions that allowed South Korea's universal free, eco-friendly (UFEF) school lunch program to become a tool for advancing social justice and ecological goals at the national scale. We analyze the socio-historical evolution and current status of the Korean school lunch program, combining the multi-level perspective with insights from environmental sociology and critical food studies, in order to shed light on the factors that enabled the program to become an innovative niche and articulate the opportunities and challenges it now faces. We identify the state-sponsored creation of what we call precautionary infrastructure as a key anchoring mechanism between the school food niche and agri-food regime. Precautionary infrastructure includes new supply chains, certification standards, and sourcing policies that provide a stable market for eco-friendly farms and small-scale producers, while minimizing the environmental health risks of school lunch by delivering organic and pesticide-free ingredients to on-site kitchens that serve free lunches to all students. This analysis offers insight into how public school-lunch programs can become protected niches that help drive sustainability transitions within agri-food systems.","[Gaddis, Jennifer E.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Human Ecol, 1300 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Jeon, June] Tufts Univ, Jonathan M Tisch Coll Civ Life, 163 Packard Ave, Medford, MA 02155 USA","Gaddis, JE (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Sch Human Ecol, 1300 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jgaddis@wisc.edu; June.Jeon@tufts.edu,,"Gaddis, Jennifer/0000-0002-4705-7528; Jeon, June/0000-0002-5440-1227","University of Wisconsin-Madison, Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education; Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation","Support for this research was provided by the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education with funding from the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.",,112,0,0,8,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-048X,1572-8366,,AGR HUM VALUES,Agric.

This work intends to develop a decision support framework to diagnose the criticality of WSNs according to an associated Water Loss Risk Index (WLRI) at pipe and zone levels. It utilized the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) to evaluate the influential factors that contribute to water losses. The Fuzzy Synthetic Evaluation Technique (FSET) has been utilized to assess WLRI at pipe level and Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operator has been used to aggregate the individual WLRI values for each zone. The framework is extended by incorporating Monte Carlo simulation model to generate the final ranking of zones. The outcomes of this simulation showed fair stability in terms of ranking the scrutinized zones. The integration of this framework in water losses management practices and planning policies of water utilities has a large potential in improving water supply services and the performance of WSNs.","[Zyoud, Shaher H.] Palestine Tech Univ Kadoorei, Dept Bldg Engn & Environm, Fac Engn & Technol, POB Tulkarem Jaffa St 7, Tulkarem, Palestine; [Fuchs-Hanusch, Daniela] Graz Univ Technol, Inst Urban Water Management & Landscape Water Eng, Stremayrgasse 10-1, A-8010 Graz, Austria","Zyoud, SH (corresponding author), Palestine Tech Univ Kadoorei, Dept Bldg Engn & Environm, Fac Engn & Technol, POB Tulkarem Jaffa St 7, Tulkarem, Palestine.",shaher.h.zyoud@ptuk.edu.ps; fuchs-hanusch@tugraz.at,"Fuchs-Hanusch, Daniela/AAF-1169-2021","Fuchs-Hanusch, Daniela/0000-0002-9766-6962; Zyoud, Shaher/0000-0002-2832-1047",,,,84,1,1,3,3,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0219-6220,1793-6845,,INT J INF TECH DECIS,Int.

Consumers demand information transparency to support informed decisions and to verify nutrition, food safety, and sustainable operations. Supporting these needs rests on the existence of interoperable Internet of Things (IoT) platforms for traceability that goes beyond the minimum one up, one down scheme required by regulators. Seafood farmers, being the source of both food and food-information, are critical to achieving the needed transparency. Traditionally, seafood farmers carry the costs of providing information, while downstream actors reap the benefits, causing limited provision of information. Now, global standards for labelling, data from IoT devices, and the reciprocity of utility from collecting data while sharing them represent great potential for farmers to generate value from traceability systems. To enable this, farmers need an IoT platform integrated with other IoT platforms in the value network. This paper presents a case study of an enterprise-level IoT platform for seafood farmers that satisfies consumers' end-to-end traceability needs while extracting data from requests for information from downstream actors.","[Jaeger, Bjorn; Mishra, Alok] Molde Univ Coll, Fac Logist, N-6402 Molde, Norway; [Mishra, Alok] Atilim Univ, Dept Software Engn, TR-06830 Incek, Turkey","Mishra, A (corresponding author), Molde Univ Coll, Fac Logist, N-6402 Molde, Norway.; Mishra, A (corresponding author), Atilim Univ, Dept Software Engn, TR-06830 Incek, Turkey.",bjorn.jager@himolde.no; alok.mishra@himolde.no,"Jaeger, Bjorn/B-6001-2017; Mishra, Alok/D-7937-2012","Jaeger, Bjorn/0000-0002-4661-5102; Mishra, Alok/0000-0003-1275-2050",,,,60,0,0,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,AUG,2020,20,15,,,,,,,4230,10.3390/s20154230,,,15,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,NM4AP,WOS:000568041400001,32751365,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2021-03-04

Existing theoretical background joint with contemporary success case studies helped to identify the essential aspects and strategies enterprises should employ to survive and thrive during crisis and post-crisis. We have conceptualized an innovative approach to COVID-19 from the perspective of organizational characteristics, operations, digital transformation, and financial planning. The findings suggest that enterprises having distributed leadership, workforce and adaptive culture sustain business operations during a pandemic. Furthermore, resilient enterprises allow for more informed and decentralized decision-making. Prosperous organizations leverage Internet and Communication Technology (ICT) and integrate Intranet, social media, and online communication platforms into their daily business routines, as this helps to establish trust and build bonds with employees, stakeholders, and customers during and post-crisis. Finally, balancing between the stockpiling of resources and resiliency is crucial in anticipation of a crisis.

This concept paper puts forward a conceptual framework for sustainable development based on the notion of intelligence for Waste-to-Energy (WtE) strategies. The pillars of intelligence are defined and the quadruple helix model for energy transitions based on waste management is established. The smart nodes of a WtE supply chain management are analytically presented and discussed. Nevertheless, the intelligent notion for a supply chain cannot stand on its own. Systematical support of a participatory process is needed via Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools and e-techniques to be promoted for collective facilitation and sustainable management. This process encompasses intelligent residents and professionals as producers of waste and smart managers to supervise the supply chain towards sustainable management of energy and waste resources. It is argued that the ICT participatory interface has a multiplying effect, especially when adopting the middle pathway approach in local and/or decentralized level towards smart energy production from waste. Innovative solutions to maximize waste efficiency through the collaborative power of ICT networks is critical to be deployed within local communities. These can be based on internet of things, big data, operational modeling, complex systems science, games and narratives, and social networks. The conceptual framework presented herein provides a basis for decision support towards sustainable development and interaction through a creative pathway of collaboration applicable to all the levels of potential synergies. Main conclusions and future challenges indicate that more research effort is required by the scientific community to leverage on the collaborative power of social networks and to efficiently apply ICT methods for adopting the socially-oriented middle pathway approach within communities' empowerment. Only on this basis may the tale of two challenges have a happy end, both for energy transition and waste management.","[Vlachokostas, Christos] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Mech Engn, Lab Heat Transfer & Environm Engn, Box 483, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece","Vlachokostas, C (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Mech Engn, Lab Heat Transfer & Environm Engn, Box 483, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",vlahoco@auth.gr,,"Vlachokostas, Christos/0000-0001-6399-248X",,,,56,1,1,8,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2020,12,15,,,,,,,5995,10.3390/su12155995,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MZ3LM,WOS:000559023700001,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

However, it is largely a low-value resource sensitive to high procurement costs. Transportation cost is typically the biggest factor in the cost of a forest biomass supply chain and is a critical factor in the planning of profitable bioenergy conversion facilities. This study presents an example of using geographical information systems (GIS) to 1) evaluate the feasibility of setting up new bioenergy facilities, 2) evaluate the location of existing bioenergy facilities, and 3) optimize the locations of facilities in Queensland, Australia. This study uses forest biomass availability estimated from 5-year harvest log volumes. The log volumes are refined to biomass energy (PJ) using a model that considers forest type, sustainable retention of residues on sites, residue proportions of total above-ground biomass and energy conversion factors. The strategic locations of bioenergy conversion facilities are defined using cluster and outlier analysis of biomass energy distribution and transportation distance using the local index of spatial autocorrelation (LISA) in a GIS environment. The tactical selection of bioenergy conversion facilities is then established based on the required number of facilities and capacity, together with the maximal distance for transporting the forest biomass. This study uses Queensland, Australia as the study area to demonstrate the effectiveness of modern GIS tools to achieve more scientific planning in bioenergy conversion facility networks and supply chain.","[Van Holsbeeck, Sam; Srivastava, Sanjeev Kumar] Univ Sunshine Coast, Locked Bag 4, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia","Van Holsbeeck, S (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Locked Bag 4, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia.",svanhols@usc.edu.au,,"Srivastava, Sanjeev/0000-0001-8402-6467",Australian Biomass for Bioenergy Assessment (ABBA) as part of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) through a University of the Sunshine Coast Research Scholarship (USCRS-ABBA) [PRJ-010376]; Gottstein Trust,"This project was funded and supported by Australian Biomass for Bioenergy Assessment (ABBA) as part of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) through a University of the Sunshine Coast Research Scholarship (USCRS-ABBA), grant number (PRJ-010376).

The first aim of this paper is to move towards CE through redesigning a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network for durable products, which are one of the most widely used category of goods. For this purpose, various recovery facilities are taken into account in CLSC structure; and cost, CO2 emissions, and energy consumption are taken into consideration as multiple objectives. The relevant mixed integer linear programming model is developed to make supplier selection, location-allocation, transportation mode, assembly technology, and recovery level decisions. Given that the strategic and tactical decisions in a CLSC are largely influenced by uncertainties, finding robust solutions is of great importance. The second aim of this study, thus, is to introduce and formulate novel robust optimization models by ways of possibilistic programming and scenario-based stochastic programming. These models are developed in linear terms to cope with different types of uncertainties including randomness and epistemic. Numerical examples are conducted based on some real energy and CO2 data. The results reveal the superiority of the circularity versus linearity in the supply chain. Pareto optimal solutions indicate the negative correlation of cost with energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The findings also show the reasonable performance of the robust models against uncertainty.","[Atabaki, Mohammad Saeid; Mohammadi, Mohammad; Naderi, Bahman] Kharazmi Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Naderi, Bahman] Univ Windsor, Dept Mech Automot & Mat Engn, Windsor, ON, Canada","Mohammadi, M (corresponding author), Kharazmi Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran.",Std_atabaki@khu.ac.ir; Mohammadi@khu.ac.ir; Bahman.naderi@khu.ac.ir,,,,,,78,2,2,14,17,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-8352,1879-0550,,COMPUT IND ENG,Comput.

The groundwater vulnerability has been evaluated using the DRASTIC model under a GIS environment. This well-known model is based on the combination of seven parameters, Depth to water, net Recharge, Aquifer media, Soil media, Topography, Impact of vadose zone, and hydraulic Conductivity, that are considered as directly controlling the vulnerability of groundwater to potential risks. However, the original model does not consider the effect of urban land uses (urban sprawl and density) on groundwater so a modified DRASTICU model, that includes Urban land use as an eighth parameter has been applied. The net recharge assessment was also modified to include the contribution of leakages from water supply network and sewage networks to the aquifer recharge. On the other hand, soil classes of the aquifer and the vadose zone that are not included in the original listing of the model have been discussed and rated. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out to evaluate the effect of each individual parameter on the vulnerability zoning and to validate the use of each one. The validation of the DRASTICU model was done through the comparison between groundwater vulnerability index and nitrate concentrations. The vulnerability map shows that all the groundwater underlying the city is exposed to pollution risks with vulnerability index varying between extreme in the centre of the city (38%), very high in eastern parts (33.6%) and high (28.4%) elsewhere.","[Safa, Gammoudi; Kamel, Zouari] Natl Sch Engineers Sfax, Lab Radio Anal & Environm, Geol Dept, Sfax, Tunisia; [Najiba, Chkir] Fac Letters & Humanities, Lab Radio Anal & Environm, Geog Dep, Sfax, Tunisia; [El Houda, Boughattas Nour; Soumaya, Arraouadi] Reg Ctr Agr Res Sidi Bouzid CRRA, Sidi Bouzid, Tunisia; [Monji, Hamdi] Reg Commissary Agr Dev Sidi Bouzid RCAD, Sidi Bouzid, Tunisia","Safa, G (corresponding author), Natl Sch Engineers Sfax, Lab Radio Anal & Environm, Geol Dept, Sfax, Tunisia.",safa_gammoudi@outlook.fr,,,,,,104,1,1,5,8,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1464-343X,1879-1956,,J AFR EARTH SCI,J.

Therefore, choosing a resilient-green supplier to build a supply chain environment with flexibility and greenness under interruption becomes necessary for research works. However, the existing studies tended to focus on only one of the factors with resilience and greenness, and no comprehensive criteria system and performance value is expressed by a crisp number.

Firstly, BWM is used to weigh the criteria; secondly, intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are introduced into the ranking stage.

The study is further trying to illustrate an approach for analyzing the relative intensities of these risks in the present uncertain business environment. Design/methodology/approach Risk on the overall demand is assessed by a combined Bayesian - multi-criteria decision-making approach. Data related to the different factors, affecting their product demand is collected from major automobile firms. Then, weights for these factors are evaluated by applying the analytic hierarchy process approach. Further, these weights are used in the Bayesian analysis network to evaluate the risk intensity for different subgroups, namely, political, economic, social, technological and environmental. Findings From the literature and experts' opinion, total 16 risk factors have been finalized and these are further grouped into 5 categories i.e. political, economic, social, technological and environmental. It is observed that the demand for organizations functioning in the automotive sector is more vulnerable to economic risk as compared to other risks considered in the study. Practical implications Managers and decision makers of associated organizations can use the proposed framework to assess the demand risks so as to pre-evaluate their demand corresponding to future changes. Factors can be added or removed and importance could be assigned to different risk factors according to the prevailing business environment for an organization or sector. This will also help the organizations to conduct a more effective risk management in an uncertain business environment. Originality/value The study will help in better understanding of the various demand risks prevalent in the Indian auto sector. The methodology used, provides a novel approach for assessing the macroeconomic demand risks and can be used by the firms working in the automotive sector. The proposed methodology could be used for assessing supply chain risk or any other business initiative risk. The suggested approach will help managers in devising flexible management techniques so as to mitigate the risk.","[Kumar, Girish; Jain, Rishabh; Kain, Raman; Naveen] Delhi Technol Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Delhi, India; [Singh, Rajesh Kr.] Management Dev Inst, Gurgaon, India","Singh, RK (corresponding author), Management Dev Inst, Gurgaon, India.",girish.kumar154@gmail.com; rksdce@yahoo.com; rjain61b@gmail.com; kain.adhyanrk@gmail.com; ndeshmukh0074@gmail.com,,,,,,109,0,0,3,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1934-8835,1758-8561,,INT J ORGAN ANAL,Int.

In this sense, this paper addresses a multi-objective robust mathematical model to study an environmentally conscious solar photovoltaic supply chain under correlated uncertainty. The proposed model aims at minimizing the environmental impacts of included activities in the concerned supply chain in addition to minimizing the conventional cost objective. To quantify and assess the relevant environmental impacts, a life cycle assessment-based model is accomplished employing the ReCiPe 2008 approach embedded in the SimaPro software tool. The augmented epsilon-constraint procedure is deployed to optimize the proposed multi-objective model, which is able to attain compromise solutions from the Pareto-optimal set. Correlated uncertainty whose importance is underlined in the real-life situations of the photovoltaic industry is also tackled exploiting a robust optimization method. Ultimately, the validity of the presented model is vindicated through discussing a case study. The acquired results endorse the effectiveness and usefulness of the model and offer prominent practical and managerial insights. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Because government is a powerful and omnipresent entity, scholars and executives alike could benefit from greater understanding of how firms react to risk emanating from the policymaking process. To help address this gap, we use resource dependence theory to develop hypotheses concerning the accumulation of inventory by firms to buffer against their exposure to potential policy changes and how such a link might be moderated by macro-level and industry-level factors. Data from 19,634 firm-year observations reveal that firms accumulate more inventory as a buffer against policy risk under conditions of high policy uncertainty and high industry dynamism. Overall, our findings support the predictions of resource dependence theory and refine understanding of supply chain responses to macro-level uncertainty by demonstrating the contingent influence of government policy. In doing so, our study provides a foundation for future research to explore the intersections between government actions and supply chain activities and offers insights for managers and policymakers about how to factor government into their decision calculi.","[Darby, Jessica L.] Auburn Univ, Harbert Coll Business, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Ketchen, David J., Jr.] Auburn Univ, Dept Management, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Williams, Brent D.] Univ Arkansas, Supply Chain Management, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Tokar, Travis] Texas Christian Univ, Supply Chain Management, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA","Darby, JL (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Harbert Coll Business, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",,,,,,,127,3,3,12,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1523-2409,1745-493X,,J SUPPLY CHAIN MANAG,J.

Designing an efficient and reliable medical waste reverse supply chain (MWRSC) is extremely beneficial to society. Most studies on this issue have only considered the generated waste and have not reported the uncertainty in the amount of medical waste generation and other MWRSC parameters. Sustainability criteria and environmental issues in choosing treatment technology are rarely considered as well. In this research, a linear programming model under uncertainty is developed to design an MWRSC. The proposed model is multi-item and multi-period with three objective functions. The first objective function minimizes total costs, the second objective function is relevant to the best treatment technology selection and the third objective function minimizes the total medical waste stored. A robust possibilistic programming approach is utilized to handle imprecise parameters in the model and a fuzzy goal programming method is employed to build up a multi-objective model. A real case study is conducted to illustrate the potential of the proposed model which involves different attributes and problems, such as the location and capacity of facilities, and the type of treatment technology. Furthermore, the transferring amount of medical waste among different nodes is calculated. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

For large used machinery, restoration processes are divided into reuse, remanufacture, recycle (3R) based on their condition. To quantify the environmental impacts of the 3R processing arising from the quality uncertainty of returns, this study presents a model that analyzes the carbon footprint at different processing nodes, and then establishes a quantitative relationship between environmental indexes and processing quantities at these nodes. Also, the overall condition of the returned cores can be directly reflected by processing quantities. As opposed to passive assessment, we then derive two optimal strategies to maximize the environmental benefit under different acquisition scenarios using stochastic analysis of the quantity distribution. The results, which were grounded with the data of engine remanufacturing, illustrate that prioritizing higher quality returns is not necessarily the best strategy. Rather, there exists an optimal overall quality coefficient that can maximize the comprehensive benefit of remanufacturing. Which provides the theoretical basis for managers to devise optimal acquisition strategy for maximal production efficiency with lower energy and resource input. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach Following a qualitative design, we conducted 23 in-depth semi-structured interviews with owners and managers of apparel sub-suppliers. To corroborate research findings, the views of owners and managers were triangulated by further interviewing 18 key representatives of wide-ranging institutional actors. Findings The findings suggest that owners and managers of sub-suppliers use two decoupling responses: (1) consensual strategy to compromise sustainability requirements (2) concealment strategy. In addition, this paper identifies multiple institutional types of conflicting logics: instrumental logic, legitimacy logic complexity and gaps in normative logic, which interplay amongst sub-suppliers whereby permit to decouple the implementation of supply management practices. Research limitations/implications While the current paper provides an early contribution from the perspectives of second-tier and third-tier suppliers, future research could be extended to include further upstream sub-suppliers and downstream tiers including the end consumers. Practical implications It is important for brand-owning retailers and first-tier suppliers to predict sub-suppliers' decoupling behaviour and conflicts for supply management practices implementation since they may present potential vulnerability for buyers and lead suppliers.

In real environments, applying a recovery policy can be a feasible strategy to handle disruptions. Hence, in this study, a recovery policy has been addressed in the form of reallocating suppliers to alternative cross-docks or altering the transportation strategy to move shipments. In addition to cross-dock location design, the optimum capacity of opened cross-docks will be determined considering the loads that will be served by each cross-docking center under regular and disruption conditions. A mixed integer nonlinear programming formulation is presented for the problem and is then linearized to present an efficient model. In order to solve it, two Lagrangian relaxation algorithms are designed and tested on 40 problem instances with different values of parameters. The results achieved by GAMS/CPLEX are compared with those of two algorithms and some analyses are performed on the solutions. Moreover, as the case study, the focus has been placed on logistic part of a car-manufacturing company with a vast supply chain network, containing more than 600 suppliers. The logistic strategies have been applied in order to reduce the transportation cost through the supply chain network and diminish the disruption subsequences in such a network.

This mathematical score of vulnerabilities is combined with environmental knowledge to determine the vulnerable nodes and attack paths. IoT and ICS systems have unique dynamics and specific functionality as compared to traditional computer networks, and therefore, the legacy cyber security models would not fit these advanced networks. In this paper, we studied the CVSS v3.1 framework's application to ICS embedded networks and an improved vulnerability framework, named CVSSIoT-ICS, is proposed. CVSS(IoT-ICS)and CVSS v3.1 are applied to a realistic supply chain hybrid network which consists of IT, IoT, and ICS nodes. This hybrid network is assigned with actual vulnerabilities listed in the national vulnerability database (NVD).

The complexity of the situation has resulted in the emergence of various models encompassing important factors of threat neutralization. Various characteristics of airborne threats considered important for their assessment have already been identified in previous literature, which include speed, distance, approach angle, maneuverability, and so on. Due to the possible extent of loss to critical assets, literature has emphasized on identifying as many useful characteristics of threats as possible. This study is also a step in this direction to improve the weapon assignment for threat neutralization. Weapon assignment based on a well-calculated threat index is a key to success in military conflicts. The purpose of this article is to identify new factors through the involvement of experts. In this study, a set of factors has been identified through a survey of relevant literature and semi-structured interviews followed by its refinement through a three-round Delphi study. The results suggest that airborne threats are considered different from other threats due to their lethality and consequences. The top-level decision-makers require a comprehensive understanding of the criticality of the situation and the effects of poor decisions. Besides other factors, weapon stock, supply chain information, and analysis of vulnerable assets/points in threat neutralization are critical to accomplish higher efficiency. The shortlisted factors yield a foundation of a comprehensive framework for decision making in a highly dynamic environment of air defense.","[Naseem, Afshan; Ahmad, Yasir] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Coll E&ME, Rawalpindi, Pakistan","Ahmad, Y (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Coll E&ME, Dept Engn Management, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.",yasir.ahmad@ceme.nust.edu.pk,"ahmad, yasir/AAZ-7036-2020","ahmad, yasir/0000-0002-5264-8621",,,,52,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2158-2440,,,SAGE OPEN,SAGE Open,JUL,2020,10,3,,,,,,,2158244020963066,10.1177/2158244020963066,,,11,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Sciences - Other Topics,NW0NO,WOS:000574706400001,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

Lack of access to technologies and information, poor infrastructure and lack of access to markets and environmental factors play a key role in deterring sustainable smallholder livestock farming. In recent years, studies have provided evidence that livestock species can play a role towards solving household food insecurity and enhancing Africa's resilient livelihoods, particularly in rural settings. However, no studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of emerging technologies (available information technologies) as risk mitigation tools for smallholder livestock farmers. The study used survey data from 278 interviewer-administered questionnaires and 13 in-depth interviews village herds from Dumba, Mapayi, Old Nuli and Shabwe to explore whether rural SLF would use the emerging technologies to enhance their operations, and mitigate supply chain risk, exposures to stock theft and loss. Empirical results show the overwhelming need for the use of emerging technologies by the SLF, and that emerging technologies have significant and positive effects on the risk management activities. SLF indicated that, using digital technologies, they could enhance their risk mitigation and value chains. The results of the study have several policy implications. For instance, the agricultural comparative advantage should be improved through various emerging agricultural technologies. Moreover, the immediate rural development service networks for SLF could be strengthened through the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform to reduce livestock risk exposures, disasters and market reactions. Although rural livestock farming in Beitbridge has survived over the years at a subsistence level, the paper provides some interesting and pertinent findings, and projects some possible future research pathways.","[Gwaka, Leon; Dubihlela, Job] Cape Peninsula Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management Sci, ZA-7441 Cape Town, South Africa","Dubihlela, J (corresponding author), Cape Peninsula Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management Sci, ZA-7441 Cape Town, South Africa.",gwaka@law.upenn.edu; dubihlelaj@cput.ac.za,"Dubihlela, Jobo/ABE-4987-2020","Dubihlela, Jobo/0000-0001-6228-6524",,,,29,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,JUL,2020,10,7,,,,,,,270,10.3390/agriculture10070270,,,11,Agronomy,Agriculture,MT1MV,WOS:000554733300001,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

Motivated by the above analysis, this study investigates the integrated optimization of the location and inventory of EMU maintenance component distributions. Aiming to improve the sustainable operation for high-speed railway, we proposed a corresponding nonlinear mixed-integer programming model to determine the location of the distribution center (DC) for EMU maintenance component delivery, inventory control strategy, and corresponding service level. The above optimization model is solved by an adaptive improved genetic algorithm. The proposed model and algorithm are applied to a real-world case study on China's EMU maintenance components. The findings show that a higher service level is not better to achieve the lower total cost in the maintenance component distribution network. The ratios of transportation modes are significant to balance the service level and total cost of the EMU distribution network. Furthermore, the unit out-of-stock cost and the service level both show great impacts on the total costs of the EMU distribution system. Finally, there exists an optimal ratio of different transport modes, which ensures the least total cost of the EMU distribution system.","[Zhang, Dezhi; Yang, Shuxin; Fan, Jiajun; Ji, Bin] Cent South Univ, Sch Traff & Transportat Engn, Changsha 410075, Peoples R China; [Li, Shuangyan] Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Coll Logist & Transportat, Changsha 410004, Peoples R China","Ji, B (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Sch Traff & Transportat Engn, Changsha 410075, Peoples R China.",dzzhang@csu.edu.cn; YangShuXin@csu.edu.cn; t20050768@csuft.edu.cn; fanjiajun@csu.edu.cn; chcujibin@csu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71672193, 71371181]","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant numbers 71672193 and 71371181.",,50,0,0,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2020,12,13,,,,,,,5447,10.3390/su12135447,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MM5ZU,WOS:000550235300001,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

The mixed-integer programming model captures several real-world factors by introducing an additional objective function and a set of new constraints in the model that outbound logistics channels find difficult to reconcile. The sustainable model minimises CO(2)emissions from transportation and total costs incurred in facilities and the transportation channels. Design of Experiment (DoE) is integrated to the meta-heuristic based optimiser to solve the model in two phases. The DoE-guided solution approach enables the optimiser to offer the best stable solution space by taking out solutions with poor design features from the space and refining the feasible solutions using a convergence algorithm thereby selecting the realistic results. Several alternative solution scenarios are obtained by prioritising and ranking the realistic solution sets through a multi-attribute decision analysis tool, Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The robust model provides the decision maker the ability to take decisions on sustainable open alternative optimal routes. The outcomes of this research provide theoretical and methodological contributions, in terms of integrated bi-objective location-routing model and its two-phase DoE-guided meta-heuristic solution approach, for the distribution side of three-echelon logistics networks.","[Validi, Sahar] Univ Huddersfield, Sch Business, Logist Transport & Supply Chain Subject Grp, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England; [Bhattacharya, Arijit] Univ East Anglia, Norwich Business Sch, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Byrne, P.

This paper considers weight reduction technology selection and network design problem in a real-world corporation in China which produces, sells and recycles polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles used for soft drinks. The problem is addressed while taking consideration of future regulations of carbon emissions restrictions. First, a deterministic mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to analyze the influence of economic cost and carbon emissions for different selections in terms of the weight of PET bottle, raw material purchasing, vehicle routing, facility location, manufacturing and recycling plans, etc. Then, the robust counterpart of the proposed mixed-integer linear programming model is used to deal with the uncertainty in supply chain network resulting from the weight reduction. Finally, results show that though weight reduction is both cost-effective and environmentally beneficial, the increased cost due to the switching of the filling procedure from hot-filling to aseptic cold-filling and the incumbent uncertainties have impacts on the location of the Pareto frontier. Besides, we observe that the feasible range between economic cost and carbon emission shrinks with weightreduction; and the threshold of restricted volume of carbon emission decreases with the increase of uncertainty in the supply chain network.","[Han, Shuihua; Zha, Ling] Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yue] Fujian Univ Technol, Sch Management, Fuzhou, Peoples R China; [Leung, Stephen C.

The closing of the loop to handle return, uncertainty in business environment, various supply chain risks, impact network design processes and performance of the firm in the long term. Thus, it is important to design robust and reliable supply chain structures and obtain network configurations which can always outperform the other configurations under the worst cases of risks and uncertainty. A generic closed-loop supply chain network based on mixed integer programming formulation is proposed with direct shipping to the customer from manufacturing plants as well as shipping through distribution centers under supply risks, transportation risk and uncertain demand using a robust optimization (RO) approach. A large number of numerical tests are carried out to test the performance of the model by considering a total of four levels of uncertainty for four different network structures types. The results of the tests confirm that the risk and uncertainty based integrated supply chain network models are more efficient (cost effective) than the other set of network configurations which treats the supply chain risks and uncertainty post-ante. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model, the case of an Indian e-commerce firm which wants to redesign its supply chain structure is presented. The results of case study show that the topology obtained from integrated treatment of risk and uncertainty called as RORU model, outperform other supply chain networks on various network performance indicators such as supply chain costs, the number of facilities open or close and the amount of products flowing through supply chain echelon. Thus, RO based mathematical modeling to address risks and its applicability for SCND for close loop supply chain is proposed, demonstrated and applied in practical cases.","[Prakash, Surya] BML Munjal Univ, Sch Engn & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Gurgaon, Haryana, India; [Kumar, Sameer] Univ St Thomas, Opus Coll Business, 1000 LaSalle Ave, Minneapolis, MN 55403 USA; [Soni, Gunjan; Rathore, Ajay Pal Singh] Malaviya Natl Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India; [Jain, Vipul] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Management, Victoria Business Sch, 23 Lambton Quay,Pipitea Campus,POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand","Kumar, S (corresponding author), Univ St Thomas, Opus Coll Business, 1000 LaSalle Ave, Minneapolis, MN 55403 USA.",suryayadav8383@gmail.com; sameerkumar724@gmail.com; gsoni.mech@mnit.ac.in; Vipul.Jain@vuw.ac.nz; apsr100@yahoo.co.in,", SURYA Prakash/O-8135-2017",", SURYA Prakash/0000-0003-4147-9399; Jain, Vipul/0000-0002-4421-5535",,,,64,10,10,19,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0254-5330,1572-9338,,ANN OPER RES,Ann.

Traditional power systems are facing serious environmental and social issues while renewable energy systems possess low reliability due to the intermittent nature of energy sources. This paper addresses the sustainable and reliable power system design problem in an uncertain environment by using an approach called multi-objective fuzzy robust programming. The proposed approach, which is an integration of robust programming and two main branches of fuzzy programming (possibilistic and flexible programming), solves the presented multi-objective problem by simultaneously improving both sustainability and reliability, as well as by capturing uncertain factors. The objective is to determine the optimal number, location, capacity, and technology of the generation units as well as the electricity generated and transmitted through the network while minimizing the sustainability and reliability costs of the system. The proposed model considers uncertainties in the demand, the intermittent nature of renewable energy resources, and cost parameters. A case study in Vietnam was conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed model. Results show that the proposed model improves the total cost of the power system, including sustainability and reliability costs, by approximately 4.2% and reduces the computational time by 20% compared to the scenario-based stochastic programming approach. Our findings also show that due to risk disruption, the reliability cost of the power system increases to 56.72% when more electric power is generated. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Increasing consumers' demand for organic food reinforces the rate of organic farming adoption and the level of farmers' risk acceptance. Despite the recorded 20% growth in organically managed farmland, its global land area is still far less than expected, only 1.4%. Increasing demand for organic food is an important pathway towards sustainable food systems. We explore this consumer-centric approach by developing a theoretically- and empirically-grounded agent-based model. Three behavioral theories - theory of planned behavior, alphabet theory, and goal-framing - describe individual food purchasing decisions in response to policies. We take wine sector as an example to calibrate and validate the model for the case study of Sydney, Australia. The discrepancy between consumer intention and purchasing behavior for organic wine can be explained by a locked-in vicious cycle. We assess the effectiveness of different policies such as wine taxation, and informational-education campaigns to influence consumer choices. The model shows that these interventions are non-additive: raising consumer awareness and increasing tax on less environmentally friendly wines simultaneously is more successful in promoting organic wine than the sum of the two policies introduced separately. The phenomenon of undercover altruism amplifies the preference for organic wine, and the upping point occurs at around 35% diffusion rate in the population. This research suggests policy implications to help decision-makers in the food sector make informed decisions about organic markets.","[Taghikhah, Firouzeh; Voinov, Alexey; Shukla, Nagesh; Filatova, Tatiana] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Ctr Persuas Syst Wise Adapt Living, Sch Informat Syst & Modelling, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Voinov, Alexey; Filatova, Tatiana] Univ Twente, Enschede, Netherlands","Taghikhah, F (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Ctr Persuas Syst Wise Adapt Living, Sch Informat Syst & Modelling, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",Firouzeh.Taghikhah@uts.edu.au; Alexey.Voinov@uts.edu.au; Nagesh.Shukla@uts.edu.au; Tatiana.Filatova@uts.edu.au,,"Voinov, Alexey/0000-0002-2985-4574; Taghikhah, Firouzeh/0000-0002-0851-6816; Shukla, Nagesh/0000-0002-8421-3972","Faculty of Engineering and IT (FEIT), University of Technology Sydney","The first author would like to thank Faculty of Engineering and IT (FEIT), University of Technology Sydney, for the research scholarship.",,63,2,2,13,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

In the CPS, when the supply chain is disturbed and interruption occurs, supply chain resilience measurement is important to reduce order losses in the supply chain. In this paper, firstly, according to the operational characteristics of different resilience measures, strategy of the supply chain in the interrupted environment is described. Secondly, based on the cost composition of the supply chain operating in the interrupted environment, measurement model of supply chain resilience is established. Thirdly, by introducing the time that the customers can wait as an indicator to represent the external demand environment of supply chain, the customer expectation can be distinguished quantitatively, and the customer expectation factor can be integrated into the measurement model of supply chain resilience. Finally, based on the measurement model of supply chain resilience, quantitative results of the supply chain resilience measurement are obtained, and the relationship between the results and resilience measures is analyzed based on resilience analysis, which illustrates the relationship between the unit capital investment and its ability to reduce order losses.","[Chen, Liwei] Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China; [Dui, Hongyan; Zhang, Chi] Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Management Engn, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China","Dui, HY (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Management Engn, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China.",duihongyan@zzu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [U1904211, 61807031, 71501173]; Key Science and Technology Program of Henan Province, China [132102210560, 162102210004]","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial supports for this research from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos.

However, a range of risks relating to food safety and product fraud requires this industry to develop an effective traceability solution. In response to this biometric identification techniques are seen as a possible solution to provide greater security compared to the current tag-based tracking systems. This paper describes how a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be used in conjunction with image processing techniques to enable an autonomic grading solution in the SRL supply chain. The research is an essential part of an overall investigation into designing a low-cost biometric identification solution for tracking lobsters along their supply chain from catch to table. By using a CNN, the research aims to improve the previous research on lobster grading in establishing a reliable and flexible traceability method to meet different supply chain contexts. In this approach, a pre-trained Mask-RCNN model was adopted to extract regions of interest from lobster images. The deep learning ability of this model allows the carapace areas to be segmented from lobster images automatically for calculating grading attributes including size, weight and colour. This outcome then also generates a high-quality input dataset for the follow-up research on identifying individual lobsters. To prove the effectiveness, the proposed method was validated on a large image dataset collected at a lobster processor and tested on mobile application environment. The findings establish a critical contribution to the complete biometric solution developed for SRL products traceability.","[Vo, Son Anh; Scanlan, Joel; Turner, Paul] Univ Tasmania, EICT Sch, Private Bag 65, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia","Vo, SA (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, EICT Sch, Private Bag 65, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",son.vo@utas.edu.au,"; Turner, Paul/J-7455-2014","Scanlan, Joel/0000-0003-2285-8932; Turner, Paul/0000-0003-4504-2338",,,,39,4,4,7,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0956-7135,1873-7129,,FOOD CONTROL,Food Control,JUL,2020,113,,,,,,,,107184,10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.107184,,,10,Food Science & Technology,Food Science & Technology,LC4UY,WOS:000525322400001,,,,,2021-03-04

As a result, legislation in many countries requires that firms comply with specific environmental and safety standards before introducing their products in these markets. However, there is no unified global standard, and a set of local rules governs most of the markets. Therefore, products complying with the regulations of one market may not be compliant with the standards laid out in the other. This means that large firms must include the local regulatory requirements of their targeted markets into account when making their sourcing decisions. The rise in the enforcement of compliance legislation has overlapped with an increase in the trend of global sourcing, where manufacturers have opted for a diversified and offshore supplier base. With the issue of compliance legislation in place, the suppliers who otherwise would produce functionally identical products become differentiable based on their ability to fulfill compliance requirements of the targeted markets. Also, the suppliers have incentives to exaggerate their compliance ability or may lack the technical capability to ascertain this information completely. Therefore, there always resides a degree of uncertainty about a supplier's actual compliance capability. On the market side, there is uncertainty concerning product demand in individual markets. These two sources of uncertainty make this a rather challenging problem. We propose a formulation of supplier selection and product allocation decisions in this problem based on a two-stage robust optimization method. Through a set of numerical experiments, we discuss some exciting insights about the role of uncertainty in compliance failure on overall profitability and flexibility in the supply chain. We show that 3% supply-side uncertainty has almost the same effect on the quality of worst-case profit as 30% deviation from the nominal demand.

To date, seismic risk analysis of such facilities mainly focuses at component level, with the inherent dynamic interaction between the supporting structure and non-structural components not receiving the merited attention. In the present study, the seismic performance of an actual facility comprising of a piping system and a reinforced concrete (RC) supporting structure is analyzed through a finite element model in the nonlinear regime, both as coupled and decoupled case. Plastic strains are used as engineering demand parameters (EDP) to define leakage limit state for pipes. Since the RC pipe rack supporting structure is designed for low seismic loads, shear is recognized as the predominant failure mode. The same components are then analyzed in unison, considering coupling due to dynamic interaction. Fragility functions are estimated for both cases using multiple stripe analysis. A set of strong ground motions artificially generated using the specific barrier model, are employed for developing fragility curves. They are expressed with peak ground acceleration (PGA) as an intensity measure. Statistical estimation of the parameters of fragility functions are based on maximum likelihood method. It is inferred that in the decoupled case, pipes show higher vulnerability at lower PGA, at higher PGA pipe rack can fail suddenly resulting in total failure of the system. Moreover, in coupled case the fragility of the pipes and RC rack changes substantially because of the piping system boundary conditions. Thus, concluding that the risk estimation could be erroneous if dynamic interaction is neglected.","[Farhan, Muhammad; Bousias, Stathis] Univ Patras, Dept Civil Engn, Patras 26504, Greece","Farhan, M (corresponding author), Univ Patras, Dept Civil Engn, Patras 26504, Greece.",muhammadfarhan.nust@gmail.com; sbousias@upatras.gr,,"Farhan, Muhammad/0000-0002-7250-4801","European Commission through the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks (ITN), XP-Resilience project [721816]","The support European Commission's Framework Program Horizon 2020 to the first author, through the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks (ITN), XP-Resilience project (Grant Agreement No 721816), is greatly acknowledged.",,42,1,1,5,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1570-761X,1573-1456,,B EARTHQ ENG,Bull.

The employment opportunities of recycled concrete aggregates will inevitably remain cautious due to the absence of well-established performance criteria. This paper is to investigate the influence of different granular compositions (recycled coarse and fine aggregate) on the mechanical characteristics and durability of concrete. Five series of concrete mixes, manufactured with various granular combinations (natural/recycled), were studied The formulation of the reference concrete was based on a constant quantity of 400 kg/m(3) of cement and a constant workability of fresh concrete securing S2 class of flowability and C25/30 concrete class, according to European standards. The experimental program consisted of comparing the long-term mechanical strength of concrete conserved in different types of water baths: fresh tap water sourced directly from the supply network, deionized water, and salt water. Also, the durability indicators were observed, such as capillary water absorption, porosity accessible to water, helium gas permeability, and an ammonium nitrate leaching test. The obtained results have highlighted the superiority of concrete composed of natural aggregate over concrete incorporating recycled aggregate for mechanical behaviour, case-observed with three types of water used as a conservation bath. The replacement of natural aggregate by recycled aggregate does not provide any substantial improvement in terms of durability. The use of recycled sand in concrete increases its porosity and vulnerability to an aggressive environment. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, selecting the most suitable sustainable feedstock is a key factor for optimum renewable products allocation problem. To address the issue, this study proposes a hybrid adaptive framework based on consensus evaluation approach, weighting and ranking procedure, and preferred demand assignment under dynamic hesitant fuzzy sets. In this respect, the consensus evaluation approach is tailored regarding the direct and indirect feedback mechanisms to enhance the quality evaluation of candidate sustainable feedstocks under assessment criteria. Thereby, the weight of each criterion is determined based on the developed dynamic hesitant fuzzy entropy method and the candidate sustainable feedstocks are ranked with respect to developed dynamic hesitant fuzzy positive and negative ideal solutions. Then, a revised multi-choice goal programming model is extended regarding the dynamic hesitant fuzzy closeness indexes to attend to preferred compromise response of demand centers by optimum renewable products allocation. Meanwhile, the presented hybrid adaptive framework is implemented to a real case study to represent the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is provided by defining eight comparison indexes to compare the obtained results with two recent studies in relevant literature for representing the validation and verification of the proposed approach. The comparative analysis shows that the proposed approach versus the two other approaches has merits such as modeling of uncertainty, experts' weights, adaptive structure, unanimous agreement-based approach, and last aggregation framework. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is represented to show the sensitiveness and robustness of the obtained results from changing the criteria weights, goals values, and consensus elimination. Thereby, the sensitivity analysis indicates that the obtained ranking results are sensitive to sustainability criteria unlike the technical criterion.","[Gitinavard, Hossein; Shirazi, Mohsen Akbarpour; Zarandi, Mohammad Hossein Fazel] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn, 424 Hafez Ave, Tehran, Iran","Shirazi, MA (corresponding author), Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn, 424 Hafez Ave, Tehran, Iran.",gitinavard@aut.ac.ir; akbarpour@aut.ac.ir; Zarandi@aut.ac.ir,,,,,,38,2,2,1,6,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

In this study, we tested the efficacy of a biosorption-based approach to recover REEs from leachate solutions derived from North Dakota lignite coal and Powder River Basin (PRB) coal fly ash. A pairwise comparison was performed using a range of cell densities of two distinct bacteria, including an Escherichia coli strain previously genetically engineered for cell surface display of lanthanide binding tags, and Arthrobacter nicotianae, a native bacterium that exhibits high REE adsorption capacity. At optimal cell densities, we observed a recovery efficiency of 80% for total REEs and > 90% for middle and heavy REEs from the lignite leachate. Higher cell densities were required to achieve a similar total REE recovery efficiency in the PRB leachate due to its higher non-REE content, which negatively impacted light REE recovery. Despite the chemical complexity of both feedstocks, separation factors >= 30 were observed for Nd relative to nearly all non-REE metals after a single adsorption/desorption cycle, highlighting the high adsorption selectivity for REEs. Quantification of impurities in the extracted metal solutions revealed that Ca and Mg content in the leachate solutions play a dominant role in both the REE recovery yield and purity. The Mg/Ca impurities can be further reduced by incorporation of a low pH wash step between the adsorption and desorption steps, yielding extracted concentrates with a REE purity (mass fraction REE of total metals) of 80% and 50% for lignite and PRB, respectively. Thermodynamic speciation analysis of the REE-enriched eluents from both feedstocks suggests that at a post-biosorption hydroxide precipitation step can be employed to yield high purity total REE precipitates. Collectively, these results highlight the utility of biosorption for selective REE recovery from coal byproducts and pave the way for a sustainable route to diversify the REE supply chain.","[Park, Dan; Deblonde, Gauthier; Jiao, Yongqin] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Phys & Life Sci Directorate, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Middleton, Andrew; Smith, Ryan; Hsu-Kim, Heileen] Duke Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Deblonde, Gauthier] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Glenn T Seaborg Inst, Phys & Life Sci, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Laudal, Dan; Theaker, Nolan] Univ North Dakota, Inst Energy Studies, 2844 Campus Rd Stop 8153, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA","Park, D (corresponding author), Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Phys & Life Sci Directorate, Livermore, CA 94550 USA.",Park36@llnl.gov,"Deblonde, Gauthier J-P./I-7295-2019","Deblonde, Gauthier J-P./0000-0002-0825-8714; Jiao, Yongqin/0000-0002-6798-5823","Department of Energy, Office of Fossil Energy DE-NETL Rare Earth ProgramUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FWP-LLNL-18-FEW0239]; U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National LaboratoryUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DEAC52-07NA27344 (LLNL-JRNL- 789319)]","This research is supported by the Department of Energy, Office of Fossil Energy DE-NETL Rare Earth Program under award DE-FWP-LLNL-18-FEW0239.

Companies, based on the field of activity, decide to strengthen some of their capabilities, capacities, and expertise. Therefore, the focus of an organization on the strengths and efforts to develop its sustainability will lead to a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Due to changes in environmental factors, organizations have focused on carbon emissions in procurement and transportation that have the highest carbon footprint. This paper proposes a multiobjective, eco-sustainability model for a supply chain. The objectives are to minimize overall costs, maximize the efficiency of transportation vehicles and minimize information fraud in the process of information sharing within supply chain elements. Big data is considered in the amount of information exchanged between customers and other elements of the proposed supply chain; since there are frauds in information sharing then using big data 5Vs the model is adapted to control the cost of information loss leading to customer dissatisfaction. Since uncertainty is inevitable in the real environments, in this research hybrid uncertainty is considered. Because two sources of uncertainty are considered in most of the parameters, thus it is necessary to robustify the decision-making process. The model is a mixed integer nonlinear program including big data for an optimal sustainable procurement and transportation decision. A heuristic method is used to solve the big data problem that makes use of a robust fuzzy stochastic programming approach. The proposed model can prevent disturbances by using a scenario-based stochastic programming approach. An effective hybrid robust fuzzy stochastic method is also employed for controlling uncertainty in parameters and risk taking out of outbound decisions. To solve the multi-objective model, augmented epsilon-constraint method is utilized. The model performance is investigated in a comprehensive computational study. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was conducted on a sample of 348 Chinese 3PLs. Stepwise regression was adopted to analyse the data. Findings It is found that LCSCI has a positive effect on firm performance. From the social network perspective, a larger scope of outsourcing increases 3PLs' embeddedness, which increases their chance of success in initiating LCSCI, especially for 3PLs with higher decarbonisation capabilities. Interestingly, although the pressure from government regulation can also motivate LCSCI, it is less effective for 3PLs with higher decarbonisation capabilities because they can be too embedded in the network to freely adapt to regulations. Research limitations/implications This study has investigated 3PL-initiated LCSCI only from the view of 3PLs. A dyadic approach which includes the perception of customers would be desirable. Practical implications The results highlight the critical role of 3PLs as supply chain orchestrators in decarbonising supply chains, and the effectiveness of LCSCI as a competitive strategy of 3PLs. Coercive pressures from government regulations are not constraints but resources for 3PLs in initiating LCSCI, especially in markets where the 3PLs have insufficient decarbonisation capabilities. Originality/value This study contributes to theories on 3PLs' interorganizational low-carbon initiatives, LCSCI, and the paradox of social networks in supply chains.","[Liu, Xiaohong; Qian, Cheng; Wang, Shenghui] Sch Business, Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China","Liu, XH; Qian, C (corresponding author), Sch Business, Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xliu@cufe.edu.cn; qiancheng@cufe.edu.cn; wangshenghui@cufe.edu.cn,,,"Beijing Natural Science FoundationBeijing Natural Science Foundation [9162015]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71902205, 71573292, 71774182]","Author names are listed alphabetically and all authors contributed equally.

Supply chains are exposed to new environmental regulations to reduce their carbon emissions and compelled to consider other overlooked factors, such as risk. In this paper, we consider a multi-echelon multimodal supply chain network design problem with multiple products and components that take economic, environmental and risk factors into account. The problem is modeled as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming model and constrained by a carbon cap-and-trade scheme and a risk threshold. This novel problem realistically portrays the supply chain network design considering sustainability and reliability factors simultaneously. The proposed model has been tested on randomly generated hypothetical but realistic test instances. The impacts of different risk thresholds and unit carbon prices on the supply chain cost, risk and emissions are analyzed. The effects of multimodal transportation modes on cost, risk and emissions are also tested. Results prove that using multimodal transportation decreases supply chain cost and carbon emission. In addition, the total supply chain cost and carbon emission increase if the decision maker is risk-averse. The choice of transportation modes is sensitive only to emission levels.","[Kabadurmus, Ozgur; Erdogan, Mehmet S.] Yasar Univ, Dept Int Logist Management, TR-35100 Izmir, Turkey","Kabadurmus, O (corresponding author), Yasar Univ, Dept Int Logist Management, TR-35100 Izmir, Turkey.",ozgur.kabadurmus@yasar.edu.tr,"Kabadurmus, Ozgur/ABC-4885-2020","Kabadurmus, Ozgur/0000-0002-1974-7134",,,,40,0,0,8,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0254-5330,1572-9338,,ANN OPER RES,Ann.

Challenges in meeting this demand include climate change; deficiencies in enabling environments, resources, and capacities; and inappropriate institutional models of RD&E and development. Smallholders must improve productivity, volume, quality, and consistency of supply, but their downstream customers must also be competitive. Most smallholder supply chains lack the capacity for this. Therefore, new, vibrant agricultural innovation systems, or AIS, and improved enabling environments are vital. This paper outlines a transdisciplinary framework for investigating and facilitating these changes. It is based on the literature, projects, and experiences working in a range of developed and developing countries. A dualistic agribusiness systems model can help identify the complexity of problems, and the constraints to improving the productivity of smallholders and their value chains.

As contemporary supply chains are intricate networks exposed to ample vulnerabilities, a resilient supply chain with inbuilt capabilities for responding to unanticipated events can assume significance. This paper proposes a decision support model for managers for knowing, measuring and improving the level of resilience in manufacturing supply chains. A novel computational methodology involving the incidence analysis and grey theory is proposed in this study. Using the methodology of advanced analysis of grey incidences, the level of resilience of supply chains can be measured. Various strategies and attributes imparting resilience, particularly relevant to the manufacturing industry are analyzed in this research. A framework considering five strategies and twenty-three attributes contributing to supply chain resilience is also constructed. And a case evaluation has been conducted to implementing the proposed methodology. Managers can ascertain their supply chain resilience capabilities by means of synthetic resilience index, as recommended in this study. From the measures of resilience for the bygone period, top management can assess and improve the resilience capabilities of their supply chain, by taking strategic level decisions.

This study aims to commercialize micro-algae as a new source of energy. In the first stage, we utilize the Best-Worst Method (BWM) to determine the best cultivation system, and in the second stage, a bi-objective mathematical model is presented which simultaneously optimizes the economic and environmental objectives. We also propose a robust optimization model to deal with the uncertain nature of the biofuel supply chain. Our analysis on the trade-off between the supply chain's total cost and unfulfillment demand arrives at interesting managerial insights. Furthermore, to show the effectiveness of the robust optimization model, we compare the performance of the robust and deterministic models, and the results show that the robust model dominates over the deterministic model in all scenarios.

This mode of transport has been beneficial through its efficiency in the mobility of a large quantities of merchandise. In this context, inland waterway ports are one of the mainstays of the maritime transportation network. The aim of this paper is (1) to model and assess the interdependency between inland port infrastructure and its surrounding supply chain and (2) to show how the disturbance in one will have a ripple effect and trigger cascading failures in the entire network. To comprehend this interconnectedness, we outline three thorough interdependency types: geographic, service provision, and access for repair. After these interdependency types are validated, the factors related to port disruption and its supply chain performance are identified, and the Bayesian network is applied to visualize the interdependency among these factors. The quantification of interdependency is examined, and the results are profoundly analyzed through different advanced techniques such as belief propagation and sensitivity analysis. The general interpretation of these analyses entails that environmental factors and supplier responsiveness are imperative to port disruption and supply chain performance, respectively.","[Hossain, Niamat Ullah Ibne; El Amrani, Safae; Jaradat, Raed; Marufuzzaman, Mohammad; Hamilton, Michael] Mississippi State Univ, Ind & Syst Engn Dept, 260 McCain Hall, Miss State, MS 39762 USA; [Buchanan, Randy; Rinaudo, Christina] US Army, Engineer Res & Dev Ctr, 3909 Halls Ferry Rd, Vicksburg, MS 39180 USA","Jaradat, R (corresponding author), Mississippi State Univ, Ind & Syst Engn Dept, 260 McCain Hall, Miss State, MS 39762 USA.",jaradat@ise.msstate.edu,"Hossain, Niamat Ullah Ibne/ABE-1309-2020","Hossain, Niamat Ullah Ibne/0000-0002-6775-585X",,,,103,3,3,11,30,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0951-8320,1879-0836,,RELIAB ENG SYST SAFE,Reliab.

In Canada, the province of Ontario has enacted regulations regarding the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Recycling program. The objective of this study is to develop a novel scenario-based robust possibilistic approach to optimize and configure an electronic reverse logistics network by considering the uncertainty associated with fixed and variable costs, the quantity of demand and return, and the quality of returned products. A Monte Carlo simulation is utilized to analyze the performance of our proposed model. Then, ANOVA test is conducted to statistically verify our model using the simulation results. The mathematical model is extended to the multi-objective optimization by maximising the environmental compliance of the third parties. The efficient solutions of the multi-objective model are computed using the two-phase fuzzy compromise approach. To provide a comprehensive assessment of the problem under investigation, we provide sensitivity analyses on the impact of different factors (e.g., recovery rates, capacity of facilities) on the total expected profit. Several interesting results were obtained, including the fact that increasing the capacity of facilities does not automatically translate into higher profits. Furthermore, by comparing the efficient solutions of deterministic and robust modes, we illustrate the impact of robustness price on the multi-objective model.

In this paper, we theorize a new notion-the viable supply chain (VSC). In our approach, viability is considered as an underlying SC property spanning three perspectives, i.e., agility, resilience, and sustainability. The principal ideas of the VSC model are adaptable structural SC designs for supply-demand allocations and, most importantly, establishment and control of adaptive mechanisms for transitions between the structural designs. Further, we demonstrate how the VSC components can be categorized across organizational, informational, process-functional, technological, and financial structures. Moreover, our study offers a VSC framework within an SC ecosystem. We discuss the relations between resilience and viability. Through the lens and guidance of dynamic systems theory, we illustrate the VSC model at the technical level. The VSC model can be of value for decision-makers to design SCs that can react adaptively to both positive changes (i.e., the agility angle) and be able to absorb negative disturbances, recover and survive during short-term disruptions and long-term, global shocks with societal and economical transformations (i.e., the resilience and sustainability angles). The VSC model can help firms in guiding their decisions on recovery and re-building of their SCs after global, long-term crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We emphasize that resilience is the central perspective in the VSC guaranteeing viability of the SCs of the future. Emerging directions in VSC research are discussed.","[Ivanov, Dmitry] Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Dept Business Adm, D-10825 Berlin, Germany","Ivanov, D (corresponding author), Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Dept Business Adm, D-10825 Berlin, Germany.",divanov@hwr-berlin.de,,,,,,150,44,44,32,66,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0254-5330,1572-9338,,ANN OPER RES,Ann.

This paper presents a mathematical model based on a dual-channel system for designing a green supply chain. The first sales channel is based on the traditional retail purchasing system, while in the second channel the customers purchase the products from the plants directly. In the proposed model, decisions on location, products transfer and pricing are determined. Furthermore, the decision on the kind of manufacturing technology in each plant to be established is considered as well. Any kind of technology leads to a specific level of the greenness of the products in each plant. A product with a higher green level has a lower greenhouse gas emission but higher costs. In order to encourage managers to produce green products, government subsidy policies are in place. Besides, because of the uncertain nature of some parameters, a robust possibilistic optimization approach has been used. As the proposed mixed integer nonlinear model is complicated to solve, an Invasive Weed Optimization Algorithm (IWO) is proposed to obtain efficient solutions. Due to the nonlinear type of the developed model and due to there is no benchmark available in the related literature to validate the results, Cultural Algorithm (CA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) are utilized. The results indicate that IWO performs better than others. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The goal of this research work is to identifies, evaluate and analyze the factors for successful implementation of RL practices. Fifteen critical RL factors are recognized from pertinent literature and endorsed by industry professionals. This paper utilized Grey based Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) approach to sort the identified factors into cause and effect clusters. Grey DEMATEL resolves the problem of data uncertainty and impreciseness involves in decision making in analyzing the factors. The results of the study found that 11 RL factors came into causal cluster as vital factors and 4 RL factors into the effect cluster as fundamental problems factors. Among causal cluster, the highest ranked four influential factors are Top management commitment (RLF1) with weightage value 0.7604, RLF2 i.e. enforced government regulations with weightage value 0.6549, RLF6 i.e. environmental/green concerns factor with weightage value 0.5678 and RLF8 i.e. Waste minimization (especially e-waste) factor with weightage value 0.5113 are respectively. Similarly, among effect cluster, the most easily influenced two factors are Market and competition factors (RLF15) with weightage value (- 1.1207) and Increased e-commerce (RLF13) with weightage value (- 1.2855) respectively.

The ISNs are open systems with structural dynamics since the firms may exhibit multiple behaviours by changing the buyer-supplier roles in interconnected or even competing SCs. From the positions of resilience, the ISNs as a whole provide services to society (e.g. food service, mobility service or communication service) which are required to ensure a long-term survival. The analysis of survivability at the level of ISN requires a consideration at a large scale as resilience of individual SCs. The recent example of coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak clearly shows the necessity of this new perspective. Our study introduces a new angle in SC resilience research when a resistance to extraordinary disruptions needs to be considered at the scale of viability. We elaborate on the integrity of the ISN and viability. The contribution of our position study lies in a conceptualisation of a novel decision-making environment of ISN viability.

The decisions on the purchase from the uncertain suppliers, and reserving from backup suppliers are made in the first step. Then, after determining the uncertainties, return decisions (purchasing from the backup suppliers, spot market and the use of returned products) are made.

In this paper, critical factors for the implementation of closed loop supply chain practices are identified and analyzed in the Indian automotive sector. Various key factors were identified from extant literature and subsequently validated from 28 industry experts. Further, cause and effect relationships among the factors are examined by applying Grey-Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory technique. The results indicate that 'Governmental regulations and support' (R-C = 1.14), 'Increased customer awareness on environment protection' (R-C = 0.65) and 'Implementation of information technologies' (R-C = 0.34) are the most important causal factors. The paper provides recommendations for policy makers, managers and practitioners on implementation of closed loop supply chain practices for environmental management.

Food markets, supplied through both domestic production and international trade, are governed by several risks emerging from unpredictable supply chain disruptions, volatility of commodity prices, along with other unforeseen circumstances such as natural disasters. To mitigate the challenges threatening the stability of food systems, decision-making within the food sector should be enhanced and robust to accommodate any changes that might cause food shortages. Dynamic models, that can predict the behavior of food systems in order to avoid potential future knock-on effects and deficits, are incumbent to ensure the sustainable performance of food systems. This study proposes a dynamic decision-making scheme that simulates strategies of the perishable food market under different circumstances. An agent-based model (ABM) is developed and implemented using python MESA library for a case study in Qatar, illustrating the potential performance of tomato under three different scenarios to be considered, namely: (a) baseline scenario - aiming to reflect current production and market conditions; (b) water resource efficiency scenario - basing decisions on crop water requirement (CWR) depending on weather conditions; and (c) economic risk scenario - applying the concept of forward contracts to hedge against future uncertainties in crop prices. The findings of this study demonstrate that under the baseline conditions, a tomato crop can be supplied through a combination of domestic production and imports depending on the available inventories and prices imposed by exporters. The results obtained for the CWR scenario suggest the need for total reliance on imports in order to meet domestic demand, as there is potentially high-water loss, which amounts to an average of 4.9 Billion m(3) per year, if tomato is grown locally. In contrast, the results from the forward contract scenario recommend a 57% dependency on local production in order to mitigate the effects of volatility in global food prices, which contributes to a 63% reduction in environmental emissions. Findings of this research provide insight into the factors that influence strategic decision making by the food sector to enhance its economic and environmental performances under diverse circumstances.

The bi-level programming approach is used through this model to demonstrate the competition among two supply chains; the leader and the follower, respectively. After modelling the competition and applying pricing decisions by defining a price-dependent demand, disruption risks are analysed through the model. The proposed model simultaneously considers demand uncertainty and disruption risks and is capable of dealing with such uncertainties by implementing resilience strategies including, inventory decisions, and having a contract with reliable suppliers. Moreover, to consider the environmental issues, controlling CO2 emissions and managing the reverse flow were added to the model. Our approach to mitigate the problem uncertainties is to use the possibilistic programming method. The Karush-Kuhan-Tucker (K-K-T) optimality conditions are deployed to make a single-level equivalent form. Since the integrated model was bi-objective, the epsilon-constraint method is implemented to make a single objective integrated model.

To answer the research question, we conduct a literature review and develop the corresponding hypothesis. We test our hypothesis using both primary and secondary data. The results show that environmental uncertainty has a negative impact on firm financial performance, with entrepreneurial managerial capitalism mediating the impact. However, organisations that adopt macro and network supply chain risk management practices are able to improve managerial decision making frame, and mitigate the negative impact of environmental uncertainty on firm financial performance.

The main results are the following: we found that the identity of the area is structured in three groups of risk decision support models: (i) quantitative multicriteria decision models, (ii) stochastic decision-making models, and (iii) computational simulation/optimization models. We mapped six current research clusters: (i) conceptual and qualitative risk models, (ii) upstream supply chain risk models, (iii) downstream supply chain risk models, (iv) supply chain sustainability risk models, (v) stochastic and multicriteria decision risk models, and (vi) emerging techniques risk models. We identified seven future research clusters, with insights from further studies for: (i) tools to operate SCRM data, (ii) validation of risk models, (iii) computational improvement for data analysis, (iv) multi-level and multi-period supply chains, (v) agrifood risks, (vi) energy risks and (vii) sustainability risks.

LNG processing for transportation at longer distances works under cryogenic conditions, especially when used for liquefaction and gasification applications. The supply chain of the eco-environmental friendly hydrocarbon is heavily dependent on the processing plant used for liquefaction and subsequent re-gasification of the natural gas. Plate-fin heat exchangers are extensively used in the LNG industry for both re-gasification as well as liquefaction processes. The exchange of heat during the process of natural gas phase change involves plate-fin heat exchangers working under cryogenic low-temperature conditions. The heat exchangers are designed to have brazed joints that are most vulnerable to failure under these temperature conditions. One failure of such a joint can not only hinder the supply chain but also may result in fire and life hazards. In almost all earlier studies, analytical and numerical methods were used to analyze these braze joints using finite element method methods and examining the stresses while keeping them at or near to ambient conditions. In this research, the plate-fin heat exchanger is investigated for its structural stability of brazed fins for three different fin configurations: plain, wavy and compound having different joint geometries. In addition, the analyses are carried out using experimentally measured brazed joint strength which is measured to be on average 22% lower than the base material strength owing to brazing process and resultant heat-affected zone (HAZ). Therefore, the reliability is assessed for these joints in terms of factor of safety (FOS) while keeping in view the actual yield criteria. It was found that the structural stability of compound fins configuration is weakest amongst all considered fin configurations. The failure of the compound fin brazed joint is expected to be along the horizontal path of the joint due to yielding. The study also predicts the life of the fin brazed joints in different joining directions with different topologies of fins commonly recommended in the literature. It is observed that the commonly recommended safe fin geometries are predicted to be susceptible to failure if a reduction in the brazed joint is considered. The analysis and recommendation in this paper shall provide a reliable and safe design approach for plate-fin exchangers for different operating conditions especially in low to cryogenic temperature applications.","[Saggu, Mustansar Hayat; Sheikh, Nadeem Ahmed] Int Islamic Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Niazi, Usama Muhammad] Univ Teknol Petronas, Mech Engn Dept, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia; [Irfan, Muhammad] Najran Univ, Elect Engn Dept, Najran 61441, Saudi Arabia; [Glowacz, Adam] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Automat Control & Robot, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland","Niazi, UM (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Petronas, Mech Engn Dept, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia.; Irfan, M (corresponding author), Najran Univ, Elect Engn Dept, Najran 61441, Saudi Arabia.",mustansar.hayat@iiu.edu.pk; nadeemahmed@iiu.edu.pk; ukniaxi@gmail.com; irfan16.uetian@gmail.com; adglow@agh.edu.pl,"Irfan, Muhammad/AAB-6847-2019; Glowacz, Adam/N-6462-2013; Glowacz, Adam/I-1024-2019","Irfan, Muhammad/0000-0003-4161-6875; Glowacz, Adam/0000-0003-0546-7083; Glowacz, Adam/0000-0003-0546-7083; Muhammad Niazi, Usama/0000-0003-3164-7731; Sheikh, Nadeem/0000-0003-2405-1358","International Islamic University, Islamabad, Pakistan","The author acknowledges the financial support provided to this study by the International Islamic University, Islamabad, Pakistan.",,37,1,1,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,MAY,2020,13,9,,,,,,,2175,10.3390/en13092175,,,22,Energy & Fuels,Energy & Fuels,LR5MP,WOS:000535739300053,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

In recent years, risk management of PPP projects has received increasing attention. In this paper, twenty risk factors associated with infrastructure PPP projects were identified by literature review and in-depth case studies. Relationship data for these twenty typical risk factors were obtained through structured interviews. Based on the obtained data, the risk relationship network within infrastructure PPP projects was identified, and the network structure characteristics were analyzed, including individual node attributes and the influence and cohesion of subgroups. The results indicate that key risk factor nodes can form a reaction chain via bridge nodes that can trigger a risk domino effect within PPP projects. Specifically, the key risk factors of PPP projects are divided into two categories, the first of which include risk factors that have powerful and independent influence, such as delay in government approval, government credit, and imperfect legal and regulatory systems. The second category includes risk factors that are highly vulnerable and easily influenced, such as completion risks, insufficient revenue in the market, and fee change. A key risk factor reaction chain is one in which legal change leads to a decline in government credit rating, triggering a contract risk. Twelve bridge nodes were identified that play an important intermediary role in the network, e.g., legal change, public objection, and financing risk. This paper extends the application of social network analysis in PPP projects management research and identifies the key risk factors and crucial factors influencing chain reactions in PPP projects. The results provide a more in-depth understanding of sustainable PPP project management for government agencies and private enterprises.","[Wang, Yan] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Architecture, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yan] Hubei Univ Educ, Sch Architectural & Mat Engn, Wuhan 430205, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yujie; Wu, Xiuyu; Li, Jiwang] Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China","Wu, XY (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China.",hhjy98@vip.sina.com; yjwang@stu.tjufe.edu.cn; xywu@tjufe.edu.cn; yrds2014@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71571130],This research is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project Number: 71571130).,,99,2,2,11,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2020,12,10,,,,,,,4152,10.3390/su12104152,,,26,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MC6VG,WOS:000543421400210,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

Global cobalt demand is expected to quadruple in the next four decades, due primarily to lithium-ion battery demand. Uniquely, this study provides detailed geographically explicit data on the cobalt supply chain, with the aim of both determining how susceptible primary cobalt production is to supply chain disruptions, and to evaluate possible supply risks. We conclude that the risks for supply chain disruptions are high. Firstly, the cobalt market is highly concentrated, with more than half of the cobalt mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and almost half of the cobalt refined in China. Secondly, almost all cobalt is mined as a by-product of copper and nickel. Finally, political stability in production countries is considered to be medium to very weak. There are also several factors in play that reduce supply risks. The concentration of the individual mines, refineries and companies remains under the threshold of a concentrated market, and the estimated 80 artisanal cobalt mines further diversify the mined supply. A network analysis shows the important position of companies with high betweenness and degree centrality. A disruption at these companies can affect the functioning of the overall supply chain. The geographic and a network visualization provide useful insights in the supply risks.

While emerging 'smart' technologies such as the internet of things, machine learning, and cloud computing have been touted as having the potential to transform production management, the realities of their adoption and use have been much more challenging than anticipated. In this paper, we explore these challenges and present a conceptual model, a use-case matrix and a product-process framework for a smart production planning and control (smart PPC) system and illustrate the use of these artefacts through four case companies. The presented model adopts an incremental approach that companies with limited resources could employ in improving their PPC process in the context of industry 4.0 and sustainability. The results reveal that while make-to-order companies are more likely to derive greater benefits from a smart product strategy, make-to-stock companies are more likely to derive the most benefit from pursuing a smart process strategy, and consequently a smart PPC solution.","[Oluyisola, Olumide Emmanuel; Sgarbossa, Fabio; Strandhagen, Jan Ola] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway","Oluyisola, OE (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",olumide.e.oluyisola@ntnu.no; fabio.sgarbossa@ntnu.no; ola.strandhagen@ntnu.no,"Oluyisola, Olumide E/G-8163-2018; Oluyisola, Olumide E./AAR-2915-2020","Oluyisola, Olumide E/0000-0001-7944-3776; Sgarbossa, Fabio/0000-0002-9541-3515","Research Council of Norway, under the BIA project Manufacturing Network 4.0Research Council of Norway [247637]","This research was funded by The Research Council of Norway, under the BIA project Manufacturing Network 4.0, number 247637.",,71,6,6,10,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2020,12,9,,,,,,,3791,10.3390/su12093791,,,29,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LU0TK,WOS:000537476200289,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

Employing a survey-based research methodology, appropriate data were collected for a number of third-party logistics players, thus yielding a total of 708 responses from the operational managers of these firms. The research construct was validated through a rigorous procedure involving measurement and structural equation model. From a theoretical perspective, the results of this study provide evidences supporting systemic relationships between internal enablers of the logistics firms and externalities in the backdrop of environmental sustainability. Major findings indicate that transportation planning and distribution network and, commodity considerations backed by top management support can further environmental performance. Further, we also find evidence that effective transport planning and distribution network design used in conjunction with commodity considerations can be a source of sustainable supply chain performance.

The socio-technical nature of disruption compels implementation of an interdisciplinary perspective using a lens of supply-chain management. In this manner, disruption drivers are present in the internal, network, and environmental categories. Further, a quantitative method is necessary to evaluate and minimize the occurrence and effect of disruptions by promoting capability development. Therefore, natural-gas-supply security (NGSS), as a hierarchical and multi-dimensional construct, is considered to develop these capabilities. The effect of NGSS on mitigating gas-distribution disruptions, which is based on the contingency theory, is investigated to shed light on what a company should do to mitigate disruptions. Structural equation modeling is also applied to analyze the data collected through a survey questionnaire in Tehran Province Gas Company. The results show that NGSS, in the context of disruption mitigation at the company level, consists of three main dimensions: availability, infrastructure, and governance. The findings suggest that availability can be achieved by not only a sufficient supply but also efficient energy use. Further, behavioral and technological changes are essential. In addition, policies and regulations are not sufficient to develop governance; thus, structure, systems, and monitoring should be emphasized. The conclusion of this study provides an empirical basis and some insights into capabilities that aim to mitigate disruptions. These capabilities can provide reinforcement to transparency, trust, risk-management culture, and integrated supply-demand approach to prevent fluctuations in gas availability, thus promoting infrastructure that deals with environmental sustainability and subsequently addresses disruptions.

Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) can resolve many environmental management problems along with the gain of several competitive advantages for future. We formulate in this research, an integrative decision-making model for SSCM in the Indian context, which considers several strategies, interfaces, and regulations for sustainability along with the attributes contributing to each. A network model is constructed from an initial flow model and the weightings for factors were calculated using the method of paired comparison by the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Later, Analytic Network Process (ANP) has been employed for the comparison of alternative schemes for selection of a particular SSCM strategy into implementation. We assess two alternative schemes in practice for sustainability and from the results; we observe that Scheme 2 excels Scheme 1, considering sustainability capabilities. Also, from the factor weightings, we observe that standardization of nature-friendly (NF) technologies and green segment size emerges as important factors for the case supply chain. A comparison of the results from AHP and ANP is conducted with other popular multi-criteria decision-making techniques, TOPSIS and VIKOR and the results were analyzed. Also, we conduct sensitivity analysis of the results. The implications of the study are in a direction to aid the managerial decision-making process, through effectively comparing various schemes to implementation for their sustainability capabilities.","[Rajesh, R.] ABV Indian Inst Informat Technol & Management, Management Div, Gwalior 474015, Madhya Pradesh, India","Rajesh, R (corresponding author), ABV Indian Inst Informat Technol & Management, Management Div, Gwalior 474015, Madhya Pradesh, India.",rajeshambzha@gmail.com,"Rajesh, R./K-9650-2014","Rajesh, R./0000-0002-4231-0539",,,,64,10,10,3,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-791X,1879-3274,,TECHNOL SOC,Technol.

In doing so, the paper considers the technical and political challenges of building trust and equity for various stakeholders. A blockchain is a smart electronic database, distributed to all users, immutably tracking every transaction that has ever taken place on the network. The blockchain is very difficult to hack, with no single point of authority to make mistakes and collapse the system. Automated consensus protocols enable data transmitted on the network to be verified and stored immutably, minimising the risk of data corruption to near-zero. Blockchain is being increasingly hyped for a range of services and industries, including transparent resourcing for marine conservation, reducing pollution from plastics, reducing slavery at sea, and sustainable fisheries management. Public distrust in some conservation operations, as well as in the provenance of seafood, is growing. Although some global marine conservation organisations and seafood producers have found practical solutions in disruptive technologies like blockchain, riding this wave will only prove worthwhile if coastal communities and artisanal fishers are on board and stand a chance of landing a fair share of the benefits.","[Howson, Peter] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Arts & Humanities, Nottingham NG11 8NS, England","Howson, P (corresponding author), Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Arts & Humanities, Nottingham NG11 8NS, England.",peter.howson@ntu.ac.uk,,"Howson, Peter/0000-0002-3731-2775",,,,37,7,7,8,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-597X,1872-9460,,MAR POLICY,Mar.

While such connections are increasingly well documented, research on governing telecoupled systems is in its infancy. Drawing on recent discussions in sociology, we argue that models for governing telecoupled systems must consider two types of information flows. Low-bandwidth flows allow for limited information transfer but can take place over greater distances. High-bandwidth flows, by contrast, allow for more complex knowledge transfer but tend to be geographically localized due to the costs of maintaining robust connections. Using a mixed-methods case study of national sustainability certification in the wine sector in Australia and Chile, we argue that Chile's counterintuitive success in diffusing its national sustainability certification relates to its geography, which facilitated high-bandwidth connections. We conclude that telecoupling governance measures, such as jurisdictional commodity certification, need to consider the unique requirements and costs of high-bandwidth connections in allocating institutional investments.","[Marola, Elena] Novo Nordisk AS, Bagsvaerd, Denmark; [Schopfner, Judith] Partners Performance, Santiago, Chile; [Gallemore, Caleb] Lafayette Coll, Int Affairs Program, Easton, PA 18042 USA; [Jespersen, Kristjan] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Soc & Commun, Frederiksberg, Denmark","Gallemore, C (corresponding author), Lafayette Coll, Int Affairs Program, Easton, PA 18042 USA.",gallemoc@lafayette.edu; kj.msc@cbs.dk,,,,,,155,0,0,3,11,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

A two-stage stochastic programming model is developed to find an effective design strategy under stochastic and highly seasonal biomass supply. The biomass usage, as a renewable energy source, for the power generation affects the environment and society in multiple ways, such as social expectations, life-threatening issues, and greenhouse gas emissions. As a consequence, in the stochastic model, by the social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) approach, the SC's social impact is guaranteed to be larger than a minimum acceptable rate. Furthermore, the environmental risk of the SC is quantified based on its air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions and mitigated. To deal with the biomass supply uncertainty, discrete scenarios are generated using a backward scenario reduction approach. Computational results are presented on a real-life case study in Iran to show the stochastic model's applicability in evaluating the economic potential, the sustainability aspects, and the required infrastructure for the planning of the SC system.

We present a new approach to supplier evaluation and allocating the optimal order quantity from each supplier with respect to green and resilience (gresilience) characteristics. An integrated framework that considers traditional business, green and resilience criteria and sub-criteria was developed, followed by a calculation of importance weight of criteria and sub-criteria using analytical hierarchy process (AHP). We evaluate suppliers using the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The obtained weights from AHP and TOPSIS were integrated into a developed multi-objective programming model used as an order allocation planner and the epsilon-constraint method was used to solve the multi-objective optimization problem.

Accordingly, this study develops a novel multi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming model for a closed-loop green supply chain network design problem. The proposed model aims to minimize the total costs, total CO2 emissions, and robustness costs in both forward and reverse directions, simultaneously. To cope with flexible constraints and epistemic uncertainty in the model's parameters, a robust flexible-possibilistic programming approach is tailored. The model is solved using an efficient interactive solution approach, in which, the presented model is analyzed under various carbon emission mechanisms to assess the influence of these mechanisms on the achieved solution. An illustrative example in the copier industry is also provided to validate the applicability of the presented optimization model. Numerical results indicate the superiority of the carbon cap-and-trade policy in most of the cases.","[Boronoos, M.; Mousazadeh, M.; Torabi, S.

In line with this target, biomass is a promising alternative source for the generation of clean energy and the development of a sustainable society. The use of animal and agricultural wastes is one of the very promising renewable energy alternatives paving the way for a more sustainable energy network. Animal and agricultural wastes as biomass sources do not endanger food security and mitigate environmental impacts and may therefore considerably contribute to an appropriate waste management. As a result, converting animal and agricultural wastes to energy is a challenging issue that has attracted the attention of academic and industrial researchers. A multi-echelon multi-objective model is developed to design a sustainable supply chain for bioenergy generation through the anaerobic digestion process. The model maximizes economic and social objective functions, representing direct economic profits and positive social externalities such as job creation and economic development, respectively. Factors affecting the international supply chain include imports of intermediate production equipment, exports of a final product, international business terms applied, customs duties, and foreign exchange rates. Bioenergy and fertilizers are outputs considered in this study; the former to be converted to electricity in a biogas plant to meet domestic demands, and the latter to be exported. A case study for the Golestan province is used to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed model. The results support the potential for three biogas power plants in Gonbad-e-Kavoos, with an annual production capacity of about 1000 tons of fertilizer and an electricity supply for 101,556 households per month. There is still a broad field of promising avenues for future research. Studying uncertainty in different supply chain parameters and using robust optimization to deal with uncertainties are recommended approaches.","[Bijarchiyan, Mohadeseh; Sahebi, Hadi; Mirzamohammadi, Saeed] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Ind Engn, Tehran 1684613114, Iran","Sahebi, H (corresponding author), Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Ind Engn, Tehran 1684613114, Iran.",hadi_sahebi@iust.ac.ir,,,,,,34,2,2,3,4,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2192-0567,,,ENERGY SUSTAIN SOC,Energy Sustain.

In the upper level of the hierarchy, the government's policies on planning and controlling the waste management infrastructure aim to overcome the environmental concerns related to the disposal of waste materials. On the other hand, the follower of the hierarchical process decides about waste collection plans considering the government-approved infrastructure to minimize total operational costs. From this point of view, the present study proposes a bi-level mathematical formulation to model the problem of hazardous waste management. Also, to tackle the highly fluctuating nature of hazardous waste generation rates, our study addresses the most probable, optimistic and pessimistic scenarios of this key parameter. To solve the problem under uncertainty, a multi-part solution methodology combining the robust optimization approach, a method of reformulating the bi-level model into Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation as well as a feasibility repairing mechanism is applied.

It aims to understand the special properties of the GSCM system under the moderating effects of product complexity and purchasing structure. Design/methodology/approach A thorough literature review led to the building of the conceptual framework. Six constructs were identified using systems theory. These constructs include green supply chain technological dimensions (particularly, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based), green supply chain strategy, green supply chain process, product complexity, purchasing structure, and firm performance. The instrument was scientifically developed for gathering survey responses using complete design test methods. The conceptual model was eventually tested based on survey data collected from 250 automotive components and allied manufacturers in the emerging economy of South Africa. Findings The results indicate that GSCM technological dimensions (AI-based) positively influence GSCM strategy. Further, GSCM strategy was found to positively influence the GSCM process. The GSCM processes have significant effects on environmental performance, social performance, and financial performance. The product complexity has a significant moderation effect on the paths GSCM strategy and GSCM process. Originality/value The findings from multivariate data analysis provide a better understanding of GSCM system dynamics and are helpful to key decision-makers. This unique model has elevated GSCM theory to a new level. There are limited studies available in the existing GSCM literature using systems theory. This study will offer an advanced/comprehensive understanding to readers in this relatively new concept.","[Bag, Surajit] Univ Johannesburg, Coll Business & Econ, Dept Transport & Supply Chain Management, Kingsway Campus, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Gupta, Shivam] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier Res Management, Montpellier, France; [Kumar, Sameer] Univ St Thomas, Opus Coll Business, Dept Operat & Supply Chain Management, St Paul, MN 55105 USA; [Sivarajah, Uthayasankar] Univ Bradford, Sch Management, Bradford, W Yorkshire, England","Kumar, S (corresponding author), Univ St Thomas, Opus Coll Business, Dept Operat & Supply Chain Management, St Paul, MN 55105 USA.",skumar@stthomas.edu,"Sivarajah, Uthayasankar/AAU-7065-2020; Gupta, Shivam/R-2996-2016","Gupta, Shivam/0000-0002-2714-4958",,,,130,3,3,18,47,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1741-0398,1758-7409,,J ENTERP INF MANAG,J.

No one has a comprehensive system solution to providing more, cheaper, better, and faster health care, even in primary care practices, the first link in the health care supply chain. Additionally, this link like others frequently experiences the combination of complexity, uncertainty, and local optimisation simultaneously to create a chaotic environment. Health care problems have been called ill-structured (also 'wicked) and because of their tangled web of stakeholders with different and conflicting objectives defy traditional optimisation research methodologies. Proper design and management of the provider appointment scheduling system (PASS) provides a direction for a win-win health care solution (more, cheaper, better, and faster). Our objective is to provide a generic strawman process for developing a robust PASS for most environments. A theory of constraints thinking processes (TP) analysis was conducted on the academic research using a primary care practice to validate both entity and causality existence. From this integrated analysis, a robust process for designing a PASS resulted. Last, we show that Goldratt's TP provides a logical, rigorous framework for qualitative research and design science.","[Cox, James F., III] Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Boyd, Lynn H.] Univ Louisville, Dept Management, Coll Business, Louisville, KY 40292 USA","Cox, JF (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",jcox@uga.edu,,"Boyd, Lynn/0000-0001-5538-1355",,,,116,7,7,8,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2047-6965,2047-6973,,HEALTH SYST,Health Syst.,APR 2,2020,9,2,,,,,124,158,,10.1080/20476965.2018.1471439,,,35,Health Policy & Services,Health Care Sciences & Services,ME2AR,WOS:000544462700003,32939256,Green Published,,,2021-03-04

Developing the networks and infrastructure required to make these processes economically viable depends on high quality information about the volume and characteristics of food waste requiring treatment. Traditionally, food waste generation estimates have come from limited empirical studies and theoretical tools that predict the volume of food waste that will result from different types and intensities of economic activity. Resulting estimations are quick and don't require extensive investment to collect, but only provide single, static snapshots of expected waste generation. In reality, however, food waste would vary depending on the season, geography, and type and magnitude of the waste generating activity. This study provides an analysis of this potential variability using empirical data from commercial and institutional food waste generators in New York State and a publicly available database of food waste estimates. Results show that 57 % of food waste generated within the region comes from only 4 % of commercial facilities. Moreover, statewide generation varies monthly by approximately 37 % and significantly across different regions due to concentrations of facility locations. Study findings underscore how policy or facility siting decisions based on a single, static food waste estimation may not capture the full complexity of food waste management. Future work can improve common estimation approaches and methods for collecting empirical data to support robust policy.","[Armington, William R.; Babbitt, Callie W.] Rochester Inst Technol, Golisano Inst Sustainabil, 190 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA; [Chen, Roger B.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Civil & Environm Engn, 2540 Dole St, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Babbitt, CW (corresponding author), Rochester Inst Technol, Golisano Inst Sustainabil, 190 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA.",wra9936@rit.edu; cwbgis@rit.edu; rbchen@hawaii.edu,,"Chen, Roger/0000-0002-0528-6007",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CBET-1639391],"This study was funded by the National Science Foundation (CBET-1639391).

However, government's random environmental inspection, weather disaster, and other accidents have resulted in supply disruption for local sourcing. In this paper, we study how operational decisions such as pricing, ordering, and the selection of sourcing structure between Overseas Sourcing (OS) and Domestic Sourcing (DS) help improve supply chain sustainability. We study both the economic and environmental sustainability performances under alternative sourcing structures (OS and DS), where we identify a win-win situation. Interestingly, the MNF's profit difference between DS and OS is non-monotonic in its brand image advantage, because the domestic supplier might snatch the MNF's brand value using the pricing power, resulting a high local sourcing price. When the MNF's brand image advantage and the unit pollution/quantity ratio are both small, the MNF obtains more profits and incurs less pollutant under DS.","[Niu, Baozhuang; Xie, Fengfeng; Mu, Zihao] South China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China; [Ji, Ping] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Mu, ZH (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China.",bmniubz@scut.edu.cn; xiefengfeng1996@163.com; mzhscut@sina.com; p.ji@polyu.edu.hk,"Ji, Ping/AAN-1475-2020","Ji, Ping/0000-0002-7841-6677",NSFC Excellent Young Scientists Fund [71822202]; NSFCNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71571194]; Chang Jiang Scholars ProgramProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT); GDUPS,"The authors are grateful to the managing editor and three reviewers for their helpful comments.

Both, the complexity and the uncertainty, are the result of dynamic interactions between multiple system elements within three major systems: (i) the physical environment; (ii) the social environment; and (iii) the constructed infrastructure environment including pipes, roads, bridges, buildings, and other components. Recent trends in dealing with complex water resources systems include consideration of the whole region being affected, explicit incorporation of all costs and benefits, development of a large number of alternative solutions, and the active (early) involvement of all stakeholders in the decision-making. Systems approaches based on simulation, optimization, and multi-objective analyses, in deterministic, stochastic and fuzzy forms, have demonstrated in the last half of last century, a great success in supporting effective water resources management. This paper explores the future opportunities that will utilize advancements in systems theory that might transform management of water resources on a broader scale. The paper presents performance-based water resources engineering as a methodological framework to extend the role of the systems approach in improved sustainable water resources management under changing conditions (with special consideration given to rapid climate destabilization).

As the source is disseminated over a large area and affected by seasonality, the potential benefit is highly dependent on other cost and benefit trade-offs along the supply chain. This review paper aims to assess operational management research methods used in biofuel supply chain planning, including both upstream production and international downstream trading. There have been considerable operational management studies done on upstream processes in biofuel production based on different strategic and tactical decision making of a single or multiple feedstocks, considering economic and environmental factor. However, the environmental consideration is often limited to carbon emission where the other environmental impact such as land-use change, biodiversity loss, irrigation and fertilisation are often being overlooked. Biofuel supply chain and trading at international level remain as an apparent research potential where only limited numbers of global energy models explicitly simulate international bioenergy trade. The leading biofuel producing countries in Southeast Asia: Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, are selected as a case study to investigate further on how the supply chain management model could be applied considering the existing biofuel support policies. This study is expected to contribute to the selection of operational management research methods used for decision making under robust policy context, followed by several recommendations.","[Ying, Hoo Poh] NUS, ESI, Singapore 119620, Singapore; [Chien, Cassendra Bong Phun] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Chem & Energy Engn, Johor Baharu 81300, Malaysia; [Van, Fan Yee] Brno Univ Technol VUT Brno, Fac Mech Engn, NETME Ctr, SPIL, Brno 61669, Czech Republic","Ying, HP (corresponding author), NUS, ESI, Singapore 119620, Singapore.",esihpy@nus.edu.sg; nitecass@gmail.com; fan@fme.vutbr.cz,"bong, cassendra phun chien/E-5220-2017; Van Fan, Yee/H-1088-2019","bong, cassendra phun chien/0000-0002-0933-7131; Van Fan, Yee/0000-0002-4591-0038","Energy Studies Institute; EU project Sustainable Process Integration Laboratory-SPIL by EU CZ Operational Programme Research, Development and Education [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/15_003/0000456]","This research was funded by the Energy Studies Institute and the EU project Sustainable Process Integration Laboratory-SPIL, project No. CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/15_003/0000456 by EU CZ Operational Programme Research, Development and Education.",,104,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,APR,2020,13,7,,,,,,,1799,10.3390/en13071799,,,26,Energy & Fuels,Energy & Fuels,LU3WB,WOS:000537688400268,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

When an enterprise is affected by a disruptive event, the consequences of the disruption not only impact in the enterprise itself, but also influences on the other partners of the network to which it belongs. Thus, disruptive events exceed the capability of individual actors, impacting on the network performance. Consequently, network partners have to collaboratively make decisions to soften the negative impacts on the performance. In this regard, after a disruption takes place, network enterprises should be aware of activating a set of sustainable and resilience strategies that attenuate the performance loss and reduce the disruption recovery time. Nevertheless, the diverse nature of disruptions means that a wide range of varied and sometimes contradictory strategies can be formulated, resulting in conflict situations among the collaborative network (CN) partners. The current paper proposes an approach that makes it possible to collaboratively manage the strategies to activate when a disruptive event occurs, so that the selected strategies are aligned. The strategies alignment approach, proposed in the paper, makes it possible to select those strategies that have a positive impact, or a minimum negative impact, on the objectives defined, not only in the enterprise itself, but also in the objectives defined by the rest of CN partners. The alignment of strategies makes it possible to reduce the performance level loss when a disruption takes place. Thus, the strategies alignment approach aims at activating those strategies that maximize the performance of the CN, achieving levels of performance equal or higher than the levels previous to the disruption, limiting the adverse effects produced by the disruptive events, and contributing to a more sustainable-resilient CN. Finally, in order to validate the proposal, a case study is presented. The proposed model is validated to deal with a drop in demand due to a political embargo, in a textile CN.","[Andres, Beatriz] Univ Politecn Valencia, Escuela Politecn Super Alcoy, Res Ctr Prod Management & Engn CIGIP, Alcoy 03801, Alicante, Spain; [Marcucci, Giulio] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Ind Engn & Math Sci, I-60131 Ancona, Italy","Andres, B (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Escuela Politecn Super Alcoy, Res Ctr Prod Management & Engn CIGIP, Alcoy 03801, Alicante, Spain.",bandres@cigip.upv.es; g.marcucci@staff.univpm.it,"Andres, Beatriz/ABA-4989-2020","Andres, Beatriz/0000-0002-7920-7711","Ayuda Vali+D Formacion-Andres Navarro [ACIF/2012/006, 16/04/12-16/04/15]",This research was funded by Ayuda Vali+D Formacion-Andres Navarro (ACIF/2012/006).

This study compares the energy efficiency indicators of road freight transportation. Additionally, effects of four mass limits of vehicle combinations are analyzed after a three-year adaptation process that took place in a wood procurement region of 100% renewable resources. The wood-based energy efficiency model (load's wood energy/fossil transport energy) was the most accurate and precise measure as the development indicator. The indicator showed that the transportation systems (60, 64, 68, and 76 t) and (64, 68, and 76 t) were carbon negative (122, 133, 144, and 108) (142, 147, and 133) in 2014 and 2016, respectively. The numbers reveal positive energy ratio of renewable wood and fossil fuels. In comparison to 60 t, the use of 68 t vehicles increased energy efficiency most effectively in the systems, by 18.0% and 20.5%, respectively. The indicator robustly revealed the energy efficiency of a partial system in the smaller supply region, which depended on the region's transportation conditions. This novel knowledge can be applied for advancing the adaptation toward carbon-neutral supply networks. There is also the development potential of an industrial ecosystem model for optimizing the environmental sustainability of green circular industry.","[Palander, Teijo; Haavikko, Hanna] Univ Eastern Finland, Fac Sci & Forestry, POB 111, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland; [Kortelainen, Emma; Karha, Kalle] Stora EnsoWood Supply Finland, POB 309, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland","Palander, T (corresponding author), Univ Eastern Finland, Fac Sci & Forestry, POB 111, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland.",teijo.s.palander@uef.fi; hanna.haavikko@gmail.com; emma.kortelainen@storaenso.com; kalle.karha@storaenso.com,,"Palander, Teijo/0000-0002-9284-5443; Karha, Kalle/0000-0002-8455-2974",,,,60,3,3,5,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2020,12,7,,,,,,,2740,10.3390/su12072740,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LL4WR,WOS:000531558100165,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

The authors investigated nine FPIs that were selected from the financial statements of 155 companies within nine industries from 2011 to 2017 using Morningstar financial database and Gartner's report. The authors find that suitable FPIs to measure SCC for shareholders' value are return-on-assets (ROA), days-sales-outstanding (DSO), and current ratio (CR). This means that higher ROA, shortened DSO, and an appropriate level of CR could reach a sustainable supply chain.

The possibility of disruption in the facilities of the supply chain is considered using the exponential distribution together with the effect of social responsibility as a significant pillar of sustainability. Various practical parameters such as accessibility of facilities, unemployment rate, number of created job opportunities, and level of regional development are considered in the modeling framework. Computational analysis is provided using the real dataset of a communication technology company as a case study to manifest the performance of the proposed model. A sensitivity analysis is performed for some specific parameters to recognize the most effective factors of the proposed model.

This paper introduces a novel supply chain network design problem to cover three dimensions of sustainability, namely economic, environmental, and social. The advantage of the presented model stems from considering the booming development aligned with reduction in environmental impact. In this paper, to achieve the mentioned benefits and to derive a more sustainable supply chain, a novel model in the presence of the most commonly used carbon policies is proposed. This paper, addresses sustainable development through imposing proper carbon regulatory mechanisms. Main contribution of this study is to consider the effect of imposing carbon policies on environmental advantages as well as improving the regional development level in a supply chain network design problem. Moreover, the shipment consolidation decisions are utilized to reduce cost as well as environmental impact. In addition, a novel mixed uncertainty approach is proposed to capture the uncertain emission parameters. The numerical examples and a case study are analyzed to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. It is concluded that, a high-growth economy with low-carbon can be made and also almost global well-being of people is ensured by applying the proposed model. Some managerial insights are provided for the enterprises of supply chains to make the most appropriate sustainable decisions.

The synthesis, design and economic aspects of constructing a processing system using this technology are well-developed and have recently reached the stage of industrial implementation. Nonetheless, the early stage of technology development focuses on process and product safety and tends to ignore other risk aspects that are closely associated with the biomass value chain. Due to the complex nature of the biomass value chain, conventional risk mitigation strategies are ineffective in mitigating risks at the management level. More recent approaches, particularly stochastic programming methods, have yielded robust results in addressing technological risks and design uncertainties. However, such approaches are still unable to effectively consider non-quantitative risks such as business risks and regulatory risks. Hence, this study proposes a combined method of an analytical model and stochastic programming approach to prioritize risks and risk mitigation strategies for decision-making purposes. This work presents a novel multiple-criteria decision-making expert system based on fuzzy set theory, which is the Decision and Evaluation-based Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (DEFANP) method. The novel method functions to prioritize risk mitigation strategies within a network relationship of project goals, key components of the biomass industry and industrial stakeholders. As the stochastic risk mitigation counterpart, the fluctuations and uncertainties in operations, transportation, market supply-demand and price are modeled using the Monte Carlo simulation method. From this, risks of implementing biomass polygeneration systems can be mitigated by selecting a strategy that yields the highest analytical indicator while reconciling with the corresponding probabilities of achieving management goals. A palm biomass polygeneration system in Malaysia is presented as case study where the key implementation risks are regulatory risks, financing risks, technology risks, supply chain and feedstock risks, business risks, social and environmental risks.","[Ngan, Sue Lin; Leong, Wei Dong; Lam, Hon Loong] Univ Nottingham, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, Jalan Broga, Semenyih 43500, Selangor Darul, Malaysia; [How, Bing Shen] Swinburne Univ Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Fac Engn Comp & Sci, Jalan Simpang Tiga, Sarawak 93350, Malaysia; [Teng, Sin Yong] Brno Univ Technol, Inst Proc Engn, Tech 2896-2, Brno 61669, Czech Republic; [Teng, Sin Yong] Brno Univ Technol, NETME Ctr, Tech 2896-2, Brno 61669, Czech Republic; [Loy, Adrian Chun Minh] Monash Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Yatim, Puan] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Grad Sch Business, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Promentilla, Michael Angelo B.] De La Salle Univ, Ctr Engn & Sustainabil Dev Res, 2401 Taft Ave, Manila, Philippines","How, BS (corresponding author), Swinburne Univ Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Fac Engn Comp & Sci, Jalan Simpang Tiga, Sarawak 93350, Malaysia.",elynnsl.ngan@gmail.com; bshow@swinburne.edu.my; Sin.Yong.Teng@vut.cz; leongweidong@gmail.com; adrianminh@gmail.com; puan@ukm.edu.my; michael.promentilla@dlsu.edu.ph; honloong.lam@nottingham.edu.my,"Ngan, Sue Lin/AAK-4484-2020; Loy, Adrian Chun Minh/AAD-9640-2020; how, bing shen/L-2469-2019; Promentilla, Michael/AAH-5265-2020; Yong, Teng Sin/V-3902-2019","Loy, Adrian Chun Minh/0000-0003-3275-845X; how, bing shen/0000-0002-0969-9167; Promentilla, Michael/0000-0002-9009-8552; Yong, Teng Sin/0000-0002-2988-8053; Ngan, Sue Lin/0000-0002-0300-9364","Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia [LRGS/2013/UKM-UKM/PT/06]; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia [EP-2017-028]; University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus; Newton Fund; EPSRC/RCUKUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/PO18165/1]; Research Micro Fund from Swinburne University of Technology (Sarawak Campus) [9-1372 RMFST]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic under OP RDE grant [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_026/0008413]","The authors would like to thank Long Term Research Grant Scheme [LRGS/2013/UKM-UKM/PT/06] from Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia, EP-2017-028 under the leadership of Prof. Dr. Er Ah Choy, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus, Newton Fund, the EPSRC/RCUK (Grant Number: EP/PO18165/1) and Research Micro Fund from Swinburne University of Technology (Sarawak Campus) [Grant Number: 9-1372 RMFST] for the funding of this research.

Due to recent governmental regulations, environmental issues, and the development of the concept of social responsibility, the closed-loop supply chain management has been focused by many researchers. A closed-loop supply chain includes both forward and reverse supply chain networks with the purpose of combining environmental considerations with the traditional supply chain network designs through the collection of used products and activities related to their reuse. In this paper, a bi-objective, multi-period, multi-product, closed-loop supply chain network is designed under environmental considerations, discounts, and uncertainties. The deterministic model of the chain is first solved by three multi-objective decision-making methods. Then, based on real-world uncertainties involved in some of the parameters, a robust optimization model is proposed and solved using decision-making methods. At the end, the best deterministic and robust models are selected based on the displaced ideal solution.","[Nahr, Javid Ghahremani; Pasandideh, Seyed Hamid Reza] Kharazmi Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Fac Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Niaki, Seyed Taghi Akhavan] Sharif Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran","Pasandideh, SHR (corresponding author), Kharazmi Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Fac Engn, Tehran, Iran.",pasandid@yahoo.com,"Niaki, Seyed Taghi Akhavan/B-4008-2011","Niaki, Seyed Taghi Akhavan/0000-0001-6281-055X; , seyed hamidreza/0000-0003-2468-8682",,,,37,0,0,1,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2168-1015,2168-1023,,J IND PROD ENG,J.

This study puts forth an empirically supported integrative framework to understand supply chain flexibility from market-oriented and network-oriented perspectives, interrelationships among its dimensions and the effect of supply chain complexity as a contingent factor. Design/methodology/approach The online survey data were collected from 201 manufacturing companies and checked for common method variance, validity and reliability. Structural equation modeling was then used to test the hypotheses. Findings The results of this study demonstrate that there are interrelationships among market-oriented and network-oriented supply chain flexibility dimensions. It is the flexibility embedded in the supply chain network configuration that plays critical roles in superior performance in flexibility capabilities to create customer values. The interrelated effect among flexibility dimensions is contingent on the magnitude of the supply chain complexity corresponding to the number of supply chain tiers. Originality/value This study takes a step to advance understanding of supply chain flexibility from an integrative point of view consisting of market-oriented and network-oriented perspectives. This study is expected to provide practitioners the foundation to implement supply chain flexibility considering the interrelationships among flexibility dimensions. Our results suggest that to carry out a supply chain flexibility strategy, the vertical complexity of the supply chain structure needs to be taken into consideration.","[Liao, Ying] East Carolina Univ, Dept Mkt & Supply Chain Management, Greenville, NC 27858 USA","Liao, Y (corresponding author), East Carolina Univ, Dept Mkt & Supply Chain Management, Greenville, NC 27858 USA.",liaoy17@ecu.edu,,,,,,90,1,1,1,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1741-0401,1758-6658,,INT J PRODUCT PERFOR,Int.

A hybrid facility network is considered for cost-cutting and equipment sharing where the facilities of forward logistics are also equipped to provide reverse logistics services. The model considers the dynamic production and storage capacity of the facilities which can be expanded if required. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the model is tested to deal with disruptions due to man-made or natural disasters. The dynamic facility allocation enables the model to withstand the demand/supply disruptions in a disaster-affected zone. Besides this, the model considers carbon emissions caused due to manufacturing, remanufacturing, repair, storage and transportation. These emissions are regulated using cap and trade policy Thus, the proposed model balances resilience and sustainability under uncertain market demand and product returns. The chance-constrained approach is used to obtain the deterministic equivalence of the stochastic demand and returns. The paper also investigates the changes in emission and production level in each country under demand and supply disruptions. The parameters of the model are mapped with the various dimensions of big data such as volume, velocity and variety. The proposed model is solved using randomly generated data sets having realistic parameters with essential big data characteristics.","[Mishra, Shraddha; Singh, Surya Prakash] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Management Studies, Delhi, India","Singh, SP (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Management Studies, Delhi, India.",Shradhamishra625@gmail.com; surya.singh@gmail.com,,,"Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, New Delhi, IndiaDepartment of Science & Technology (India)","The authors thank the UKEIRI-UGC and Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, New Delhi, India for funding this research.",,58,3,3,10,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0254-5330,1572-9338,,ANN OPER RES,Ann.

To cope with disruptions five different risk mitigation strategies are employed. We have developed an integrated bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model to minimize the expected total network cost and the expected total amount of carbon emissions of both networks. The results demonstrate that applying strategy of integrating interdependent networks along with four other resilient strategies, especially intermediate facility and lateral transshipment strategies, will improve the performance of integrated network significantly. Also, with increasing the lifetime of products, the performance of the proposed model will be improved. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The business behavior is approached as a coopetition problem where companies need to cooperate to reduce waste discharge costs and traditional input purchase costs and dive into competition to pay a minimum share of additional costs (i.e., waste treatment, waste transportation, and transaction costs) of operating industrial symbiosis. A noncooperative game-theoretical model for sharing the additional costs is proposed that highlights the two strategies that companies can adopt aimed at sharing costs: a fair strategy and an opportunistic strategy. Then, an agent-based model is used to simulate the game iterated over time and investigate how the players can adapt their strategies according to their past experience. Simulation results show that players learn that playing the fair strategy is beneficial in the long period, despite in the short period they can gain more benefit by playing the opportunistic strategy. Findings of the paper are critically important to reduce the business and managerial barriers against the formation of industrial symbiosis networks and to stimulate innovative thinking of company managers to foster the development of the circular economy. The paper proposes theoretical, managerial, and policy implications, which are discussed in detail in a comparative manner between linear and circular economy.","[Yazan, Devrim Murat; Yazdanpanah, Vahid; Fraccascia, Luca] Univ Twente, Dept Ind Engn & Business Informat Syst, Drienerlolaan 5, NL-7522 NB Enschede, Netherlands; [Fraccascia, Luca] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn Antonio Ruber, Via Ariosto 25, I-00185 Rome, Italy","Yazan, DM; Fraccascia, L (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Dept Ind Engn & Business Informat Syst, Drienerlolaan 5, NL-7522 NB Enschede, Netherlands.; Fraccascia, L (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn Antonio Ruber, Via Ariosto 25, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",d.m.yazan@utwente.nl; luca.fraccascia@uniroma1.it,"FRACCASCIA, Luca/I-8078-2019","FRACCASCIA, Luca/0000-0002-6841-9823; Yazdanpanah, Vahid/0000-0002-4468-6193",European UnionEuropean Commission [680843],"European Union's Horizon 2020, Grant/Award Number: 680843",,95,0,0,6,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0964-4733,1099-0836,,BUS STRATEG ENVIRON,Bus.

Logistics providers often see the urbanness of an activity region as a constraint, while at the same time urban actors view logistics activities within their immediate environment as disruption. These attitudes obscure the value that logistics can provide for urban areas. The current research synchronizes the notions of urban and logistics by reconceptualizing urbanness (i.e., an area's state of being urban) from the logistics service provider's perspective. Utilizing a conceptual abstraction technique, the concept of urbanness is revised and differentiated to redefine urban areas as value clusters looking to balance supply and demand globally while also providing access to service at the local urban level. Further, logistics service providers are seen as offering value to urban areas through network logistics and localized logistics. Identifying these differentiated value propositions suggests that transportation providers should respond to urbanness not as a constraint, but as a context where ambidextrous strategies provide the greatest return. Our conceptual revision of urbanness offers promising future avenues of research dealing with urban complexity and logistics providers value appropriation.","[Rose, William J.; Ralston, Peter M.] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Autry, Chad W.] Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Rose, WJ (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",wjrose@iastate.edu,,,,,,125,0,0,2,2,PENN STATE UNIV PRESS,UNIVERSITY PK,"820 NORTH UNIV DRIVE, U S B 1, STE C, UNIVERSITY PK, PA 16802 USA",0041-1612,2157-328X,,TRANSPORT J,Transp.

In addition to traditional objectives of cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission minimization, a novel objective of priority index maximization has been introduced in the model. The priority index quantifies the qualitative social aspects, such as coordination, trust, behavior, and long-term relationships among the stakeholders. In a multi-echelon supply chain, the performance of distributor/retailer is affected by the performance of supplier/distributor. The priority index measures the relative performance index of each player within the supply chain. The maximization of priority index ensures the achievement of social sustainability in the supply chain. Moreover, to model cost uncertainty, a time series integrated regression fuzzy method is developed. This research comprises of three phases. In the first phase, a mixed-integer multi-objective mathematical model while considering the cost uncertainty has been formulated. In order to determine the parameters for priority index objective function, a two-phase fuzzy inference process is used and the rest of the objectives (cost and GHG) have been modeled mathematically. The second phase involves the development of solution methodology. In this phase, to solve the mathematical model, a modified interactive multi-objective fuzzy programming has been employed that incorporates experts' preferences for objective satisfaction based on their experiences. Finally, in the third phase, a case study of the supply chain of surgical instruments is presented as an example. The results of the case provide optimal flow of products from suppliers to hospitals and the optimal sequence of the visits of different vehicle types that minimize total cost, GHG emissions, and maximizes the priority index.","[Imran, Muhammad] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, NUST Business Sch NBS, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Habib, Muhammad Salman; Hussain, Amjad; Ahmed, Naveed] Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, Lahore 54890, Pakistan; [Ahmed, Naveed] Al Yamamah Univ, Coll Engn & Architecture, Ind Engn Dept, Riyadh 13541, Saudi Arabia; [Al-Ahmari, Abdulrahman M.] King Saud Univ, Coll Engn, Ind Engn Dept, Riyadh 11415, Saudi Arabia","Ahmed, N (corresponding author), Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, Lahore 54890, Pakistan.; Ahmed, N (corresponding author), Al Yamamah Univ, Coll Engn & Architecture, Ind Engn Dept, Riyadh 13541, Saudi Arabia.",imran.ime13@gmail.com; salmanhabib@uet.edu.pk; chamjad@gmail.com; naveed527@gmail.com; alahmari@ksu.edu.sa,"Imran, Muhammad/U-5544-2019","Imran, Muhammad/0000-0002-2286-4382; Ahmed, Naveed/0000-0002-7752-7199","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi ArabiaKing Saud University [RSP-2019/62]","This work was supported by Researchers Supporting Project Number (RSP-2019/62), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",,43,1,1,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7390,,MATHEMATICS-BASEL,Mathematics,MAR,2020,8,3,,,,,,,382,10.3390/math8030382,,,29,Mathematics,Mathematics,LA6WI,WOS:000524085900081,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

Photovoltaic solar energy also holds a significant role in the transition to sustainable energy systems. These systems and their optimal exploitation require an effective supply chain management system, such as design of the network, collection, storage, or transportation of this energy resource, without disregarding a country's certain socio-economic and political conditions. In Brazil, the adoption of photovoltaic solar energy has been motivated not only by the energy matrix diversification but also from the shortages, problems, and barriers that the Brazilian energy sector has faced, lately. However, PSE development is affected by various factors with high uncertainty, such as political, social, economic, and environmental, that include critical operational sustainability issues. Thus, an elaborate modelling of energy management and a well-structured decision support process are needed to enhance the performance efficiency of Brazilian PSE supply chain management. This study focuses on the investigation of certain factors and their influence on the development of the Brazilian PSE with the help of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps. Fuzzy Cognitive Map is an established methodology for scenario analysis and management in diverse domains, inheriting the advancements of fuzzy logic and neural networks. In this context, a semi-quantitative model was designed with the help of various stakeholders from the specific energy domain and three plausible scenarios were conducted in order to support a decision-making process on PSE sector development and the country's economic potential.

Industrial symbiosis networks (ISNs) can survive in the long run if they have high resilience to perturbations that lead to operational uncertainties. The literature highlights that the resilience of ISNs can be enhanced by ensuring high redundancy of IS relationships: accordingly, firms should exchange the same waste with more symbiotic partners. However, the impact of increasing redundancy on economic and environmental performance of IS has not been investigated so far. This paper proposes a theoretical framework to understand the effect of the redundancy strategy on the performance of companies involved in IS. Accordingly, the optimal redundancy strategy refers to an optimal number of partners to (from) which waste producers (users) should send (receive) wastes to maximize the IS performance. An agent-based model is designed to explore the proposed framework and an agent-based simulation is applied to a marble-concrete IS case. The analysis shows that the optimal redundancy strategy is influenced by the combined effect of waste market dynamicity and transaction costs, and is usually different when viewed from an economic versus an environmental perspective. The paper provides a theoretical contribution based upon the integration of operational aspects of IS with the redundancy concept in IS-based businesses. The adopted methodology is innovative as it integrates willingness to cooperate, bargaining power, and inter-company trust development into the business decision-making process. Finally, how to overcome trade-off challenges between environmental and economic performance is discussed from managerial and practical perspectives.","[Fraccascia, Luca] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn Antonio Ruber, Rome, Italy; [Fraccascia, Luca; Yazan, Devrim Murat; Zijm, Henk] Univ Twente, Dept Ind Engn & Business Informat Syst, Enschede, Netherlands; [Albino, Vito] Politecn Bari, Dept Mech Math & Management, Bari, Italy","Fraccascia, L (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn Antonio Ruber, Rome, Italy.",luca.fraccascia@uniroma1.it,,,,,,132,1,1,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-5273,1873-7579,,INT J PROD ECON,Int.

A planning horizon contains multiple periods. Different periods have different demands of products and hence should have different supply chain decisions, which mainly include facilities' locations, the environment protection level in facilities, as well as the transportation flows of products in the supply chain. For each facility in two consecutive periods, the changes of the location and environment protection level related decisions may incur adjustment cost. A bi-objective mixed-integer programming model is proposed to minimize both the total cost and the CO2 emissions of the supply chain during the planning horizon with multiple periods. A solution approach is proposed to solve the model. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm.","[Zhen, Lu] Shanghai Univ, Sch Management, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China","Zhen, L (corresponding author), Shanghai Univ, Sch Management, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China.",lzhen@shu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71422007, 71671107]",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71422007 and Grant 71671107.,,55,6,6,11,17,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2168-2216,2168-2232,,IEEE T SYST MAN CY-S,IEEE Trans.

There are various uncertain parameters in real world that if ignored may greatly affect the optimal configuration of the designed biodiesel supply chain. Scenario planning is a powerful tool which can help the decision makers for long-term planning under uncertainties. Therefore, in this paper, a scenario-based robust optimization model is presented for designing the biodiesel supply chain networks under uncertainties. Some of the parameters including demand, supply, costs, and environmental impacts have uncertain nature. For the first time, in this study, the values of these uncertain parameters are estimated by a proposed scenario-planning method. The presented scenario-planning approach is based on cross-impact analysis and visualization methods. Non-edible sources such as Jatropha, Norouzak, and waste cooking oil are considered as raw materials of biodiesel production, and for the first time Norouzak has been used as one of the sources in designing biodiesel supply chain. In addition, an environmental constraint is considered and the environmental impacts of all processes are obtained by Eco-indicator 99 method. The presented model can determine the number, location, and capacity of the facilities. The proposed model is implemented in a real case study in Iran for a 7-year planning horizon.

Suppliers contribute significantly to establishing an effective sustainable supply chain. Hence industries need to evaluate its potential suppliers precisely on sustainability criteria. In this work, a two-phase decision model using Fuzzy Interference System (FIS) along with Fuzzy Kano philosophy for the sustainable environment has been proposed to select sustainable suppliers for a large scale industry. In the first phase, sustainability criteria clustering using fuzzy Kano model has been performed for the identification of 'Must-be' criteria in economic, environmental and social dimensions. Further, sub-criteria with quantified evaluation levels for Must-be criteria have been established. In the second phase, the three distinct Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) has been developed for evaluating the Sustainability Performance Index (SPI) values of each supplier in three sustainability dimensions. In FIS, the architecture of each model is modified in such a way that each FIS engine have to compute the minimum number of rules. Finally, weights are assigned to SPI in each dimension, and suppliers are ranked for final selection. Sensitivity analysis has been performed to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed decision framework. A sustainable supplier selection problem of the iron and steel industry of India has been investigated to show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed decision framework.

As such, integrating sustainability into traditional HSC practices continues to present a challenge to governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and other humanitarian-related agencies. This study focuses on identifying and categorizing the leading enablers to green humanitarian supply chains (GHSCs) and proposes a model for improving the responsiveness based upon a fuzzy total interpretive structural modelling approach. Design/methodology/approach Total interpretive structural modelling (TISM) uses group decision-making to identify contextual relationships among each pair of enablers and elucidates the nature of each underlying relationship. The fuzzy TISM shows the level of strength (very high influence, high influence, low influence and very low influence) of each enabler in relation to other enablers, which can help to inform management decision-making. Findings GHSC management requires strategic planning of inventory and logistics management. The importance of collaborative relationship building with HSC partners for developing capability and the effective use of available resources are keys to success. These improved relationships also help to promote postponement and similar speculation-based logistics strategies, as well as advanced purchasing and pre-positioning strategies. Finally, the speed and quality of response is found to be the top enabler in GHSC management. Research limitations/implications - One noted shortcoming of the chosen research method is its reliance on subjective expert judgement. However, collecting judgements is at the basis of many research methods, and the research team took utmost care throughout the research process to allay biases. Future empirical research can further examine the relationships suggested herein. Managers can use the model developed in this research to consider impactful ways to design and execute sustainable HSCs. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is a novel attempt to identify enablers to GHSC management. Secondly, the research team has used an advanced methodology (fuzzy TISM) to develop the contextual inter-relationships among the enablers which has not been used earlier in this direction before and thus advances the GHSC literature.","[Bag, Surajit] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Transport & Supply Chain Management, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Luthra, Sunil] State Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Nilokheri, India; [Venkatesh, V.

Therefore, this study has proposed a mixed-integer linear programming to design an international network of the sugarcane-to-biofuel supply chain. To deal with uncertainty, the robust optimization approach is employed in order to maximize the profit earned from the bioethanol sales at the foreign/domestic markets, minimize the environmental impacts caused by these supply chain activities, and maximize this network generated employment. The multi-echelon supply chain model involves different production/storage capacities, bio-refineries technologies, and transportation modes. This supply chain configuration has specified the optimal production capacity/technology, the appropriate transportation mode in each route, and the bio-refineries' development capacities. The biofuel export price and the domestic/foreign markets' demands are among the SC uncertain parameters addressed through the robust possibilistic programming. Finally, the tri-objective model has been solved using an approach that considers the decision maker's preferences; the model performance has been verified by a case study performed in Iran.

Even though the literature is rife with studies that deal with the supplier selection problem, companies that actively pursue sustainability strategies may need to add metrics that show suppliers' sustainability performance. Existing models for measuring sustainability performance are limited in that they either evaluate the environmental and social performance separately, do not consider the inter-relationships between metrics across the three dimensions of sustainability, or utilize metrics that are difficult to obtain and evaluate accurately. To overcome this deficiency, we use the ANP method, that takes into account the interrelations between quantifiable and easy to obtain sustainability-related evaluation metrics. First, through an extensive literature review and feedback from an experts' panel, we select and classify salient sustainability performance metrics related to supplier evaluation. With data collected through an extensive survey amongst 144 supply chain professionals in the UK and France, we develop the interdependencies between several sustainability metrics and determine the most critical metrics by calculating their relative weights. Results show that the selected socio-economic metrics carry the most relatively important role in supplier selection. Based on the findings of the study, we discuss implications for theory and practice. The proposed evaluation system can provide details on observing sustainable supply chain performance. It can also help to get a clearer insight into sustainability with a well-established quantitative decision-making process so that business strategies can be developed with more concerns on supply chain sustainability.

As the frequently emerging disruptions may harm supply chain's sustainable performance, managers need to design an effective sustainable supply chain (SSC) resilience solution to mitigate different risks. In addition, it is critical to integrate customer requirements (CRs) in SSC resilience solution design as SSC's performance is highly determined by customer satisfaction (CS) in the customer-oriented market. This article proposes an integrative approach to achieve an effective design of SSC resilience solution, taking both CRs and risk factors (RFs) into consideration. In this study, the Kano model, decision-making and trial evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) are integrated with quality function deployment (QFD) through nonlinear programming to guide companies' design. Kano model is employed to analyse CRs qualitatively and quantitatively to determine each CR's priority and CS. DEMATEL is adopted to determine the RFs' interrelationships.

The production and recycling of shared bicycles are a closed logistics network, which can be considered a typical closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) problem. In practice, the CLSC network is influenced by social, economic and environmental factors, which impose high degrees of uncertainty and usually trigger various unanticipated risks, so controlling uncertain parameters becomes a key issue in supply chain decisions. The purpose of this research is to construct a new distributionally robust optimization model for a multi-product, multi-echelon CLSC network, in which the distributions of uncertain transportation cost, demand and the returned product are only partially known in advance. In the proposed model, robust mean-CVaR optimization formulation is employed as the objective function for a trade-off between the expected cost and the risk in the CLSC network. Further, to overcome the obstacle of model solvability resulting from imprecise probability distributions, two kinds of ambiguity sets are used to transform the robust counterpart into its computationally tractable forms. Finally, a case study on a Chinese bicycle-sharing company is addressed to validate the proposed robust optimization model. A comparison study is conducted on the performance between our robust optimization method and the traditional optimization method. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is performed with respect to the risk aversion parameter and the confidence level. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The challenging environment where they operate is affected by high variety in type and number of clients, the inventory mix and the demand profiles they have to meet. Consequently, better understanding the dynamics of warehousing operations and the characteristics of the inventory mix is critical to handle such a complexity. Design/Methodology/approach This paper proposes a decision-support framework, suited for 3PL warehouse practitioners, that aids to design and implement effective and affordable activities for measuring and improving the warehousing performances. Such goal is pursued by the framework by leading the managers through an initial mapping and diagnosis of the system, then by developing a tailored measurement system to track the performance, paving the way to the identification of the criticalities and the potential improvement scenarios. Findings This paper presents a case study on the implementation of the proposed framework at a warehouse of an Italian 3PL provider to introduce a new storage assignment policy and reduce the travelling time for order picking. Furthermore, the paper exemplifies how the framework contributes to enhance the awareness of managers on warehousing operations and the involvement of the personnel throughout the improvement process. Originality/value Instead of focusing on the proper methods and models that optimize a specific task or performance indicator, it provides a general framework that leads the managers through the decisional process, from the preliminary diagnosis of the system, to its benchmarking, towards the implementation of corrective and improving solutions.","[Baruffaldi, Giulia; Accorsi, Riccardo; Manzini, Riccardo; Ferrari, Emilio] Univ Bologna, Dept Ind Engn, Bologna, Italy","Accorsi, R (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Dept Ind Engn, Bologna, Italy.",giulia.baruffaldi2@unibo.it; riccardo.accorsi2@unibo.it; riccardo.manzini@unibo.it; emilio.ferrari@unibo.it,"Accorsi, Riccardo/AAV-9129-2020","Accorsi, Riccardo/0000-0002-2958-923X; MANZINI, RICCARDO/0000-0003-1142-9139",,,,58,0,0,3,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-7154,1758-4116,,BUS PROCESS MANAG J,Bus.

Freight forwarders should consider numerous random parameters characterizing demand and technological processes to choose the proper structure of the logistics chain. The paper aims to propose a method for choosing the logistics chain structure, based on the analysis of the total expenses as a function from the demand parameters characterizing stochastic variables of the consignment weight, the delivery distance, and the time interval between the requests in the flow of queries for cargo delivery. Four basic logistics chain structures, widely used on road transport, are described to demonstrate the selection process. The areas of the most efficient use of the logistics chain structures can be defined for the flow of requests for cargo deliveries. The paper shows such areas on the example of goods delivery by automobile transport. Determining the areas of the most efficient use of the specific logistics chain structures contributes to the effective choice of correct delivery variants by freight forwarders.","[Naumov, Vitalii] Cracow Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, Warszawska 24, PL-31155 Krakow, Poland","Naumov, V (corresponding author), Cracow Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, Warszawska 24, PL-31155 Krakow, Poland.",vnaumov@pk.edu.pl,"Naumov, Vitalii S/D-3445-2019","Naumov, Vitalii S/0000-0001-9981-4108",,,,27,0,0,0,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB 2,2020,12,4,,,,,,,1635,10.3390/su12041635,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KY3GT,WOS:000522460200353,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

These substances, restricted by law or company policy, are in focus for chemicals management processes by textile retailers. However, complex and non-transparent supply chains, and limited chemical knowledge, makes chemicals management challenging. Therefore, a function-based approach for life cycle management (LCM) of chemicals was developed, based on results of previous projects and evaluated using a two-step Delphi process. The resulting approach aims to help retailers identify and substitute hazardous substances in products, and consists of three parts: (i) a function-based chemicals management concept model for different levels of chemical information within the supply chain, (ii) tools for non-chemists which explain chemical information, and (iii) a continuous provision of knowledge to stakeholders (e.g., retailers) in a network. This approach is successfully implemented by over 100 retailers in the Nordic countries, providing the textile industry with practical and robust tools to manage and substitute hazardous chemicals in products and production processes. We conclude that the developed approach provides an explicit link, communication, and knowledge sharing between actors in the supply chain, which has proven important in chemicals LCM.","[Roos, Sandra; Jonsson, Christina; Olsson, Elisabeth; Nilsson-Linden, Hanna; Schellenberger, Steffen; Larsson, Mikael; Hanning, Anne-Charlotte] RISE Res Inst Sweden, Div Mat & Prod, Box 857, S-50115 Boras, Sweden; [Posner, Stefan] Stefan Posner AB, Statskullevagen 7, S-43955 Asa, Sweden; [Arvidsson, Rickard] Chalmers Univ Technol, Div Environm Syst Anal, Vera Sandbergs Alle 8, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden","Roos, S (corresponding author), RISE Res Inst Sweden, Div Mat & Prod, Box 857, S-50115 Boras, Sweden.",sandra.roos@ri.se; posner.stefan@gmail.com; christina.jonsson@ri.se; elisabeth.olsson@ri.se; hanna.linden@ri.se; steffen.schellenberger@ri.se; mikael.g.larsson@ri.se; anne-charlotte.hanning@ri.se; rickard.arvidsson@chalmers.se,"Arvidsson, Rickard/AAV-7598-2020","Arvidsson, Rickard/0000-0002-9258-0641; /0000-0003-1550-5557; /0000-0002-7949-2268",Swedish funding agencies Mistra and Formas in the Mistra Future Fashion program; SUPFES project; RISE; XPRES (Initiative for Excellence in Production Research),"This research was funded by Swedish funding agencies Mistra and Formas in the Mistra Future Fashion program and the SUPFES project, respectively, as well as funding from RISE and XPRES (Initiative for Excellence in Production Research), which is greatly acknowledged.",,37,1,1,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2020,12,3,,,,,,,1273,10.3390/su12031273,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LB8SF,WOS:000524899605004,,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2021-03-04

The shortage of relief supplies and timely transportation are the main difficulties in the whole relief network. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce a three-level humanitarian relief network design problem with resource reallocation of relief supplies. Based on the existing relief network system before a disaster, this problem determines the positions of candidate local distribution centers and points of distribution, while considering the relief distribution in the network under an uncertain post-disaster environment. For the uncertain variables, we consider a distributionally robust model with mean absolute semi-deviation (MASD) as a risk measure taken into the transportation time function. Under the partial probability distribution information of the uncertainties, we deduce a tractable framework of the distributionally robust model. Specifically, we derive the worse case form of the MASD objective under an ambiguity set and the safe approximations of the chance constraints under a box+ellipsoid+generalized budget perturbation set. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the model by a real case in Anambra flood.","[Zhang, Peiyu; Liu, Yankui] Hebei Univ, Coll Math & Informat Sci, Baoding 071002, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Yang, Guoqing] Hebei Univ, Sch Management, Baoding 071002, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Yang, Guoqing; Zhang, Guoqing] Univ Windsor, Dept Mech Automot & Mat Engn, Windsor, ON, Canada","Yang, GQ (corresponding author), Hebei Univ, Sch Management, Baoding 071002, Hebei, Peoples R China.; Yang, GQ (corresponding author), Univ Windsor, Dept Mech Automot & Mat Engn, Windsor, ON, Canada.",ygq@tju.edu.cn,"Zhang, Guoqing/AAV-7523-2020; Yang, Guoqing/Q-7238-2017","Yang, Guoqing/0000-0002-3633-2184; Zhang, Guoqing/0000-0003-0821-8787","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61773150, 71801077]; top-notch talents of Hebei Province [702800118009]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [RGPIN-2014-03594, RGPIN-2019-07115]","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61773150 and Grant No. 71801077), the top-notch talents of Hebei Province (Grant No. 702800118009) and Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant (Grant No. RGPIN-2014-03594, RGPIN-2019-07115).",,40,5,6,8,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1432-7643,1433-7479,,SOFT COMPUT,Soft Comput.,FEB,2020,24,4,,,SI,,2749,2767,,10.1007/s00500-019-04362-z,,,19,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",Computer Science,KS9AN,WOS:000518599800030,,,,,2021-03-04

In this paper, we focus on the optimal design problem of multi-period closed-loop supply chain network of hazardous products considering uncertain demands and returns, expandable facility capacities and social acceptable risk simultaneously. In each period, the built facilities have the ability to expand within a certain scope. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model, which can determine the number, location and expansion scale of the facilities and the forward and reverse logistics quantities between the facilities in each period simultaneously. The goal is to minimize the expected cost over the multi-period planning horizon, including the facilities building, operating and expansion costs and the costs related to manufacturing, collection, processing, recovery and transportation. In order to solve the proposed model, two classes of dummy variables are introduced to equivalently transform it into a mixed-integer linear programming, which can be optimally solved by LINGO. A case study is presented to illustrate the validity of the proposed model. The dynamic design with expansion strategy addressed in this paper is compared with two different strategies of static design and dynamic design without expansion. The results highlight that the dynamic design with expansion strategy has the advantages in saving expenses and raising the average expected collection rate of hazardous wastes.","[Ma, Hongguang; Li, Xiang] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yankui] Hebei Univ, Coll Math & Informat Sci, Baoding 071002, Hebei, Peoples R China","Li, X (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",lixiang@mail.buct.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71722007, 71931001]; Funds for First-class Discipline Construction [XK18025]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [buctrc201926]","This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71722007 & 71931001), the Funds for First-class Discipline Construction (XK18025) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities buctrc201926).",,23,2,2,7,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1432-7643,1433-7479,,SOFT COMPUT,Soft Comput.,FEB,2020,24,4,,,SI,,2769,2780,,10.1007/s00500-019-04435-z,,,12,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",Computer Science,KS9AN,WOS:000518599800031,,,,,2021-03-04

Furthermore, the harmful effects of medical waste, with their infectious nature in the environment, have increased justifies the significance of this research. In this article, forward and reverse supply chain network design for consumer medical products is considered taking into account the biological risks. The proposed model has two objectives: first, maximizing the profit obtained from subtracting the costs from the revenues of the supply chain. Revenues are gained from selling medical supplies to hospitals and medical wastes to recycling centers, as well as getting the permission to use sterilize services from clinics lacking a sterilization center. The costs include activation cost of inventory, sterilization and collection centers, transportation cost, purchasing cost of medical supplies, municipality cost for destruction of medical waste, etc. The second objective is to reduce biological risks. The primary source of infectious medical supplies is from disposable supplies and equipment. Thus, the second objective function is to minimize the distance and travel time between the clinic and the sterilization center. The proposed model is implemented in hospitals in Tehran's 4th municipal district using the Bounded De Novo Programming approach which initially attempts to redesign rare sources of the problem. The issue has two types of resource and policy constraints. The policy constraints of the problem cannot be changed, which is why the bounded De Novo Programming approach is used to solve the problem. Redesigning the capacity of the sterilization center leads to the decrease of biological risks, and in addition to can causes to increasing profitability. Also, by raising the productivity of medical waste in the recycling process, the distribution center can receive more profits.","[Alizadeh, Mehdi; Makui, Ahmad] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Paydar, Mohammad Mandi] Babol Noshirvani Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Babol Sar, Iran","Makui, A (corresponding author), Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran.",amakui@iust.ac.ir; paydar@nit.ac.ir,"makui, ahmad/S-6038-2018","makui, ahmad/0000-0001-6249-530X; Paydar, Mohammad Mahdi/0000-0002-0941-247X",,,,62,5,5,17,29,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-8352,1879-0550,,COMPUT IND ENG,Comput.

Vertical integration or system integration is a corporate strategy for chicken production managed by the focal company. This research study discusses the role of the focal company for achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) in a Brazilian food poultry supply chain. The research consisted of a single case study with the following steps: literature review, identification of the gaps, concepts synthesis, and case study. The findings indicated theoretical and empirical guidelines for SDGs. The literature review indicated the relevance of exploring some approaches to achieve sustainable supply chain management: corporate social responsibility, green supply chain management, industrial ecology, stakeholder theory, circular economy (reduce, reuse, and recycle with economic prosperity), and sustainability science. The focal company plays a strategic role in the vertical integration operation of the Brazilian poultry supply chain. The case study findings indicate the role of the focal company toward the actors, including the feed mill supplier, live poultry transport, poultry processor, rendering plant, and distributor. However, much remains to be accomplished to answer the question how to be sustainable?, especially in environmental and social issues involving all actors in the poultry supply chain. The Brazilian environmental legislation still needs to be revised to be aligned with SDGs because the legislation will not guarantee sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources. The critical issues and challenges are radical changes in business models, measurement of supply chain impacts, collaboration and network picturing, corporate social responsibility versus supply chain responsibility, stakeholder engagement, frameworks to implement SDGs, education about SDGs and public participation, and food supply chain integrated system forums.

Because of the perishable nature of products and limited shelf life, management of sustainability in PFSCs is critical. Many studies on sustainability in PFSCs have considered developed countries; however, developing countries have not gathered the required research attention in this domain. In this paper, a decision theory-based framework is adopted, where a prescriptive decision analysis methodology is used to generate preferences among the challenges to sustainability in PFSC. An integrated interpretive structural modelling-analytic network process (ISM-ANP) decision framework is formulated to identify and model key challenges to sustainability in PFSCs, keeping a developing economy like India under consideration. The contextual relationships amongst the extracted challenges are analyzed using the ISM methodology. The relationships identified from ISM are used as inputs in the ANP methodology, to generate the priority weights of the challenges. The findings of the integrated methodology show that lack of horizontal integration of farmers, poor pre-harvest management, and lack of government regulation and support are the most critical challenges for sustainability in PFSCs. The results show that organizations must work on aggregation of farm produce and integration of farmers with the market. Development of infrastructures and cold chain facilities at the farm level is necessary to mitigate these challenges to reduce wastages in PFSC. The study facilitates managers and planners to understand and enable sustainable practices in PFSCs.","[Kumar, Anish; Kumar, Pradeep] IIT Roorkee, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Roorkee, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Mangla, Sachin Kumar; Karamperidis, Stavros] Univ Plymouth, Plymouth Business Sch, Plymouth, Devon, England","Mangla, SK (corresponding author), Univ Plymouth, Plymouth Business Sch, Plymouth, Devon, England.",sachin.kumar@plymouth.ac.uk,,"KUMAR MANGLA, SACHIN/0000-0001-7166-5315",,,,94,3,3,12,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0964-4733,1099-0836,,BUS STRATEG ENVIRON,Bus.

Evaluating the monetary flows, kinetic energy (efficiency) and potential capacity (resilience) provides crucial information for economic development. In the paper, the authors analyze growth opportunities for the Chinese economy from a system science point of view, using the perspective of information entropy, based on the input-output tables. Over the past four decades of reform and opening-up, China has made remarkable progress in its economic development. In 2007, China's GDP was at its fastest pace in history at 14.2% growth. However, after the financial crisis in 2008, the global economy experienced a downward trend and China's economic development also settled on a medium-low level of development. The traditional perspective is to rank regional development only based on GDP growth, whereas here, the authors advocate another evaluation method based on efficiency and potential growth. Unbalanced regional economic development has become problematic and has become a barrier for sustainability of China's economy. The results of the research indicate firstly that China's regional development in 2007 and 2012 has been unequal between the provinces. Secondly, the authors found that Shandong province had significantly higher indicators for efficiency and potential growth than others in the same circumstances. Authors observe that provinces tend to carry out industrial policies and adjust the structure of industry on a local level. This analysis demonstrates that the spatial imbalance of efficiency and potential of economic development under the perspective of provincial-level regions. From the perspective of industry, it indicates that the supply chain is too short, mainly focusing on the mining and processing of resources and minerals in the original upstream industry chain, while the downstream is not fully utilized. These represent some unique insights yielded through this type of analysis that authors advocate applying more broadly.","[Yan, Jun; Feng, Lianyong] China Univ Petr, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Denisov, Artem] Kostroma State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Kostroma, Russia; [Steblyanskaya, Alina] Harbin Engn Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Steblyanskaya, Alina] Russian Acad Sci, Econ & Math Inst, Lab Microanal & Modeling, Moscow, Russia; [Oosterom, Jan-Pieter] Nyenrode Business Univ, Dept Management Accounting & Control, Breukelen, Netherlands","Feng, LY (corresponding author), China Univ Petr, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Steblyanskaya, A (corresponding author), Harbin Engn Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Harbin, Peoples R China.; Steblyanskaya, A (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Econ & Math Inst, Lab Microanal & Modeling, Moscow, Russia.",fenglyenergy@163.com; alinamv@bk.ru,"Denisov, Artem/AAH-2935-2019; Steblyanskaya, Alina/AAN-5095-2020","Denisov, Artem/0000-0002-3359-4103; Jun, Yan/0000-0002-2271-5387","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71874202, 71874201]; Russian state assignment of Russian Academy of Science, Central Economic and Mathematical Institute [18-118021390173-4]","This research was performed according to the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71874202, 71874201) and within the Russian state assignment of Russian Academy of Science, Central Economic and Mathematical Institute (No. of state registration-18-118021390173-4).

In addition to known inefficiencies caused by the bullwhip effect within a supply chain product flow, such as excessive inventory, it can also lead to inefficiencies in cash flow such as the cash flow bullwhip (CFB). The CFB reduces the efficiency of the supply chain (SC) through heterogeneous distribution of cash among supply chain members. This paper aims to decrease both the BWE and the CFB across a SC through applying a simulation-based optimisation approach, which integrates system dynamics (SD) simulation and genetic algorithms. For this purpose, cash flow modelling is incorporated into the SD structure of the beer distribution game (BG) to develop the CFB function. A multi objective optimisation model is then integrated with the SD-BG simulation model. Finally, a genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to determine the optimal values for the inventory, supply line, and financial decision parameters. Results show that the proposed integrated framework leads to efficient liquidity management in the SC in addition to cost management.","[Badakhshan, Ehsan; Humphreys, Paul; McIvor, Ronan] Ulster Univ, Ulster Business Sch, Derry, North Ireland; [Maguire, Liam] Ulster Univ, Fac Comp Engn & Built Environm, Jordanstown, North Ireland","McIvor, R (corresponding author), Ulster Univ, Ulster Business Sch, Derry, North Ireland.",r.mcivor@ulster.ac.uk,,,,,,67,0,0,9,37,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

This paper focuses on a channel coordination problem in a two-echelon sustainable supply chain involving one socially responsible manufacturer and one fairminded retailer. Constructing mathematical models to characterize the problem, four particular contracts are developed to investigate the environmental performance and channel profit under the framework of two non-cooperative contracts: wholesale price and two-part tariff, and two cooperative contracts: Nash bargaining and Rubinstein bargaining. Theoretical analysis verified by numerical experiments shows that the wholesale price contract performs worse than the other three in terms of the carbon emission per unit product and channel profit. In addition, the two-part tariff contract can partially coordinate the supply chain, whereas both bargaining contracts can achieve perfect coordination to provide outcomes of the centralized decision. Comparing with the fair-neutral scenarios, we find that the fairness behavior promotes the retailer's profit, but reduces the manufacturer's profit under different contracts. Sensitivity analysis reveals that with intensified fairness concerns, the sustainability level and channel profit diminish under non-cooperative contracts, but remain the same under cooperative contracts. The Nash bargaining and Rubinstein bargaining contracts are robust to the degree of the retailer's fairness behavior and could be the best choice for the socially responsible manufacturer.

The ultimate goal is to help in making decisions under uncertain environments. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, stochastic programming is used under conditions of demand, supply and process uncertainties, and a non-linear mathematical model is developed for perishable product's supply chain. Authors' study considers disruptions in transportation routes and also within the facilities and investigates optimal facility location and shipment decisions while minimising the total supply chain cost. A scenario-based approach is used to model these disruptions. The retailer level uncertainty due to demand-supply mismatch is handled by incorporating the newsvendor model into the last echelon of supply chain network. In this paper, two policies are proposed for making decisions under uncertain environments. In the first one, the expected cost of the supply chain is minimised. To also consider the risk behaviour of the decision maker, authors propose the second policy through a conditional value-at-risk approach. Findings Authors discuss the model output through various examples that are provided via a case study from the milk industry. The supply chain design and planning of the disruption-free model are different from those of the resilient model. Originality/value The major contribution of authors' work is the design of the supply chain network under disruption risks by incorporating aspects of product perishability. This work provides insight into areas such as the simultaneous consideration of demand, supply and process uncertainties. The amalgamation of newsvendor model and the approximation of the non-linearity of retailer level cost function especially in the context of supply chain under uncertainty is the first of its kind. We provide a comprehensive statistical study of uncertainties that are present in the supply chain in a unique manner.","[Dutta, Pankaj] Indian Inst Technol, Shailesh J Mehta Sch Management, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Shrivastava, Himanshu] Indian Inst Technol, IITB Monash Res Acad, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India","Dutta, P (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Shailesh J Mehta Sch Management, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.",pdutta@iitb.ac.in; himanshu.shrivastava@monash.edu,,,,,,78,2,2,5,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-5664,1746-5672,,J MODEL MANAG,J.

Previous studies have focused on nexus accounting, synergy conservation, and system optimization, but its induction mechanism along the supply chains has not been uncovered. This paper proposes a top-down structural path analysis (SPA) and combines it with an environmental input-output model (EIOM) to identify the critical final demand, consumption sectors, and supply chain paths inducing the energy-water nexus. The results show that the largest final demand of water for energy production (WFE) is capital formation, while the largest final demand of energy for water supply (EFW) is urban consumption. The distribution of WFE at different production layers shows an inverted U shape. Most WFE is indirectly consumed by other sectors, such as construction, through three-step supply chain paths. In contrast, the distribution of EFW shows a L shape, and most EFW is directly consumed by the final demand. In addition, some critical supply chain paths inducing more WFE and EFW are identified. Finally, some policies targeting the energy-water nexus management are proposed, which are conducive to resource conservation and the sustainable supply of energy and water.","[Shi, Jianglan; Li, Huajiao; An, Haizhong; Ma, Ning] China Univ Geosci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Shi, Jianglan; Li, Huajiao; An, Haizhong] Minist Nat Resources, Key Lab Carrying Capac Assessment Resource & Envi, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Guan, Jianhe] China Univ Geosci, Sch Informat Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Li, HJ (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.; Li, HJ (corresponding author), Minist Nat Resources, Key Lab Carrying Capac Assessment Resource & Envi, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",babyproud@126.com,,"Li, Huajiao/0000-0002-2071-9149","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71991481, 41701121, 41871202, 71991480]; Beijing Youth Talents Funds [2017000020124G190]; Special Project of Geological Mineral Resources and Environmental Inverstigation [DD20190463]","This research is supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 71991481, 41701121, 41871202, and 71991480), the Beijing Youth Talents Funds (2017000020124G190), and the Special Project of Geological Mineral Resources and Environmental Inverstigation(DD20190463).

Among these are Process Supply Chains that can be described as interconnected sets of entities responsible for the sourcing, production and distribution of a large set of chemical and/or bio- based products. Due to the high diversity of materials, processes and information flows such networks result in highly complex systems that are very difficult to manage. The PSE community has a critical role to support the design and management of such systems through the development of tools that are able to address such complexity. Focusing initially on a real-world process supply chain, the industrial gas supply chain, this paper identifies and discusses current contributions, challenges and perspectives in process supply chains that can guide research professionals to address such challenges. In general, such challenges encompass supply chain scope representations, modeling approaches, data management and implementation. Examples include supply chain risk and uncertainty, multiscale decisions, sustainability and resiliency. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The ratification of the Paris Agreement by Ukraine envisages an increase in the ability to adapt to the negative effects of climate change, as well as promoting low carbon development so as not to endanger food production. At the same time, water resources, on the one hand, are one of the most vulnerable to climate change components of the environment from the state of which the food security of the country depends directly, and on the other hand, the activity of the water management complex causes the emergence of both direct and indirect carbon footprint. Therefore, an indispensable prerequisite for sustainable low carbon development is the assessment of the carbon footprint of the main sectors of Ukraine's water management complex and the identification of priority measures for their decarbonisation and adaptation to expected climate change. Methods. The methodological basis for the assessment of the carbon footprint of the main sectors of the water management complex was the life cycle method (LCA), by which, based on the open data of the National Inventory of Anthropogenic Emissions from Sources and Absorption by Greenhouse Gas Absorbers in Ukraine and the statistical analysis of the results of previous studies. By means of systematic analysis of the main factors of greenhouse gas emission in the water management complex of Ukraine, the priority directions of its decarbonisation and adaptation to climate change were determined. Results. The estimated carbon footprint of Ukraine's water complex in 2017 was estimated to be 5.15 million tons of CO2-equiv, which was 1.6% of the total greenhouse gas emissions in Ukraine in 2017, and taking into account the potential carbon footprint end-use processes can be increased by up to 3%. Due to the deterioration of the water supply networks, an average of 35% of the supplied water is lost in Ukraine. Reducing network leakage by at least 10% will reduce carbon footprint by 30,000 tons of CO2-equiv annually. The priority areas for decarbonisation of the water management complex should be modernization of water supply and water treatment infrastructure, improvement of energy efficiency of pumping equipment and introduction of drip irrigation, and its adaptation to climate change development of the network of green infrastructure. Conclusions. The low-carbon development of the water management system should include the introduction and coordination of such measures, which, on the one hand, minimize the adverse effects of climate change on water resources and contribute to reducing the carbon footprint of water management activities, and on the other hand, guarantee the achievement of sustainable development goals, in particular for ensuring water and society proper sanitary conditions.","[Levkovska, Lyudmila] Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, Publ Inst Inst Environm Econ & Sustainable Dev, Kiev, Ukraine; [Irtyshcheva, Inna; Dubynska, Iryna] Admiral Makarov Natl Univ Shipbldg, Mykolaiv, Ukraine","Levkovska, L (corresponding author), Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, Publ Inst Inst Environm Econ & Sustainable Dev, Kiev, Ukraine.",levlv@ukr.net; innauamd@gmail.com; management@nuos.edu.ua,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,BALTIC JOURNAL ECONOMIC STUDIES,RIGA,"VALDEKU IELA 62-156, RIGA, LV-1058, LATVIA",2256-0742,2256-0963,,BALT J ECON STUD,Balt.

In the case of Turkey, where local agricultural systems are particularly vulnerable, lacking of resilience and innovative capacity, understanding the governance mechanisms of SFSCs would have strong implications for policy making. To this end, our aim in this study is to explore the mechanisms through which civil society driven SFSCs are governed in the city of Izmir (Turkey), referring to the actors involved in the process, institutional frameworks that are adopted and challenges experienced, that could inform policy discussions towards establishing more sustainable local food systems. In this direction, the questions we aim to answer are: (1) what are the mechanisms through which community level SFSCs are initiated and governed, (2) how collaboration takes place within these groups and through which processes, and finally (3) what the outcomes of these processes are, with respect to individual, community and local impacts experienced on the ground, and challenges associated with them. We use a descriptive case study methodology, to study seven SFSC initiatives (four food community networks, two farmers' markets and a local shop) in the city of Izmir; and collect data through qualitative semi-structured in-depth interviews (41 with producers, 32 with consumers, 11 with coordinators and 5 with experts). Our findings suggest that different mechanisms are at play within our cases, depending on aspects including their governing structures and their way and purpose of operation. While farmers had difficulties relying solely on their income from these initiatives for their livelihoods, organizational challenges experienced by food communities were mainly related to difficulties associated to managing tasks on a voluntary basis. Moreover, arriving at a shared understanding about mutual goals, in addition to finding a way to include stakeholders in the process, were among the most prevalent challenges of all initiatives.","[Kurtsal, Yaprak; Ayalp, Emel Karakaya; Viaggi, Davide] Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy","Kurtsal, Y (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy.",yaprak.kurtsal2@unibo.it,,,,,,42,1,1,0,0,FIRENZE UNIV PRESS,FIRENZE,"JOURNALS DIVISION, BORGO ALBIZI, 28, FIRENZE, 50122, ITALY",2280-6180,2280-6172,,BIO-BASED APPL ECON,Bio-based Appl.

The best and worst method (BWM) is used to determine the weight of risk factors. Then the method of linguistic value soft set is used to assess the impact of risk factors on each company's sustainable supply chain which is a multiple attribute decision making problem with language preference in the second stage. Consequently, the ranking results of sustainable supply chain of each enterprise are obtained. This study contributes to finding the key risk factors of SSCRM. Evaluating these companies SSCRM with preference information, the best practitioner can obtain. The combination of BWM and linguistic value soft set approach provides a new nonparametric theoretical method and tool for this kind of decision-making problems with this background.

After highlighting the strengths and limitations of each theoretical approach, we provide an alternative framework - which we refer to as the Geographical Political Ecology of Food Systems - that integrates the contributions that have emerged in the study of the alternative geographies of food with an understanding of capitalist processes in the food system. We do this by bringing together literature on the political ecology of food systems and multiple spatialities, including Doreen Massey's understanding of space as a heterogeneous multiplicity and Eric Sheppard's conceptualization of sociospatial positionality. We utilize research on agrarian change and AFNs in Eastern Europe to elaborate this approach. We argue that this new perspective helps navigate tensions in AFN scholarship, and provides new avenues for research and action.

Optimizing inventory levels and adjusting replenishment policies have significant effects on the operational performance and profitability of supply chains. Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) is a mutually beneficial arrangement between supplier and buyer, where the supplier is responsible for making inventory and replenishment decisions based on buyers' inventory status. Potential benefits of VMI include reducing inventories, enabling information sharing, eliminating safety stock, and reducing purchasing related costs across the supply chain. In today's supply chains, VMI operations face critical challenges related to data integrity, transparency, traceability, and single point of failure due to its centralized architecture. Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger that ensures a transparent, safe, and secure exchange of data among supply chain stakeholders. The advantages of adopting blockchain technology for VMI operations in a supply chain include decentralized control, security, traceability, and auditable time-stamped transactions. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based approach using smart contracts to transform VMI supply chain operations. We propose a generic framework using Ethereum smart contracts and decentralized storage systems to automate the processes and information exchange and detailed algorithms that capture the interactions among supply chain stakeholders. The smart contract code was developed and tested in Remix environment. We present cost and security analysis incurred by the stakeholders in the supply chain. Adopting a blockchain-based solution to VMI operations in supply chains is economically viable and provides a streamlined, secure, trusted, and transparent mode of communication among various stakeholders.","[Omar, Ilhaam A.; Jayaraman, Raja; Omar, Mohammed] Khalifa Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Salah, Khaled; Debe, Mazin] Khalifa Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates","Jayaraman, R (corresponding author), Khalifa Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",raja.jayaraman@ku.ac.ae,,"Jayaraman, Raja/0000-0002-2749-2688; omar, mohammed/0000-0001-8833-2947; Debe, Mazin/0000-0001-6328-271X",Khalifa University of Science and Technology~Research Center for Digital Supply Chain and Operations Management [RCII-2019-002],This work was supported by the Khalifa University of Science and Technology~Research Center for Digital Supply Chain and Operations Management under Grant RCII-2019-002.,,34,1,1,6,6,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,182704,182719,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3028031,,,16,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,OA6FR,WOS:000577879000001,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

Also, addressing sustainability issues, including environmental, economic, and social issues are the main goals of governments in developing and developed countries. Therefore, it has been in the interest of governments to consider strategies that could move the energy industry, especially fuel, towards clean fuel production. In this paper, the effect of government financial interventions under the coalition of bio-refineries to achieve sustainability goals has been studied. The proposed nonlinear model aims to obtain the optimum amount of biofuel production under the conditions of the cooperation of bio-refineries and government financial interventions. On the other hand, government sustainability goals are considered as functions related to economic, social, and environmental issues. Mulvey's robust approach is employed for controlling model uncertainties. For finding the best tariff policy, the MULTIMOORA approach is used by considering sustainability considerations, and the Best-Worst Approach is followed in obtaining the weights of the criteria. Furthermore, for the best tariff policy in a general coalition, sharing the profits among the bio-refineries as players in a cooperative game, fair profit distribution methods were applied. Finally, managerial results were presented by a sensitivity analysis of the tariff parameter.","[Jafarnejad, Elaheh; Hafezalkotob, Ashkan; Mohammaditabar, Davood] Islamic Azad Univ, South Tehran Branch, Coll Ind Engn, Tehran 1151863411, Iran; [Makui, Ahmad] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran 16846113114, Iran","Makui, A (corresponding author), Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran 16846113114, Iran.",amakui@iust.ac.ir,"makui, ahmad/S-6038-2018; Mohammaditabar, Davood/M-4172-2014","makui, ahmad/0000-0001-6249-530X; Mohammaditabar, Davood/0000-0003-1002-5511",,,,72,0,0,1,1,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,155873,155890,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3014460,,,18,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,NJ5VR,WOS:000566111500001,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

We theorise a notion of SC overlays and explore conditions surrounding their appearance. Such overlays occur if the negative consequences of changes in a SC structure as a result of a disruption are either amplified or mitigated by changes in the operational environment. We hypothesise that these overlays can be both reciprocal (i.e. complementary or mitigating) and aggravate (i.e. concurrent or enhancing). Our approach can be used for an efficient management of SC resilience capabilities by varying their levels over time. We show different ripple and bullwhip effect profiles, which lead to either reciprocal or aggravate overlays, and then we develop recommendations on the overlay-driven dynamic variation of resilience capability levels in order to enhance both SC resilience and efficiency through dynamic redundancy allocation. The results can be of value in selecting and deploying operational policies at the right time and scale during and after the recovery periods. Restricting analysis to the disruption period only and ignoring operational dynamics after capacity recovery can result in misleading or inefficient SC resilience and recovery policies.","[Ivanov, Dmitry] Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Supply Chain & Operat Management, Berlin, Germany","Ivanov, D (corresponding author), Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Supply Chain & Operat Management, Berlin, Germany.",divanov@hwr-berlin.de,,,,,,69,22,22,8,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

Still considered as a relatively new industry in Malaysia, the low remanufacturing rate coupled with the lack of standardization are thus seen as causing a high inclination of disruption occurrences in the remanufacturing operations. As such, this paper had identified and investigated the existing disruptions in four problematic areas, namely the production planning, infrastructure facilities, distribution networking and inventory management of the automotive remanufacturing firms in Malaysia. From the SPSS analysis and calculation of the mean and standard deviation values on the semi-structured interviews that were conducted in three remanufacturing companies, the highest contributor to the disruption risks was found to have resulted from the difficulty in obtaining the spare parts components in the production planning process. By also exploring the awareness level on environmental sustainability and the significance of remanufacturing processes among the remanufacturer companies, this analysis is thus deemed useful for not only identifying suitable actions that can be taken for mitigating the various risks faced by the automotive remanufacturers in Malaysia, but also in solving the disruptions of the remanufacturing supply chain system.","[Ropi, Nuramilawahida Mat; Hishamuddin, Hawa; Abd Wahab, Dzuraidah] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Dept Mech & Mfg Engn, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia","Hishamuddin, H (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Dept Mech & Mfg Engn, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",hawa7@ukm.edu.my,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia [GUP-2018-100]","The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia for funding this research under the Research University Grant Scheme GUP-2018-100.",,31,0,0,1,1,UNIV TUN HUSSEIN ONN MALAYSIA,JOHOR,"86400 PARIT RAJA, BATU PAHAT, JOHOR, 00000, MALAYSIA",2229-838X,,,INT J INTEGR ENG,Int.

While the IPCC Report sent an urgent cry to reduce total emissions and to achieve specific results-45% reduction by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050-reductions need to be combined with capturing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Scientific studies have shown that an annual increase of 0.4% of carbon stored in soils would make it possible to stop the present increase in atmospheric CO2. This Article focuses on carbon farming, a Climate Smart Agriculture strategy that uses plants to capture and store atmospheric carbon dioxide in soil to achieve the IPCC Report goal. This Article makes two contributions. First, recognizing the potential of private certifications to drive sales and investment (Organic-Certified food sales soared to $100 billion in 2018), this Article designs a new Carbon Farming Certification with an Organic or Regenerative Agriculture certification as a base, and an add-on module to measure carbon sequestration. Second, a carbon farming certification becomes a linchpin to accessing a greater network of resources to scale-up carbon farming: farmers leverage the Certification to gain access to immediate and long-term financing; to unlock lucrative opportunities to sell carbon credits to those who purchase carbon offsets in California's cap-and-trade market; and to engage in forward contracting with major supply chains. State and local governments should leverage sequestered carbon metrics from Carbon Farming Certified-farms to demonstrate compliance with international law and treaty targets, as well as national and local climate policies. Filling gaps in food law and environmental governance literature, this Article presents a multidisciplinary approach to solving a critical global problem. It identifies barriers which hinder the scale-up of promising carbon farming strategies, including: insufficient information, lack of funding for innovation to drive down solution costs, inconsistent regulations that hinder project development and private sector commercialization, and a patchwork of quantification standards for ensuring carbon sequestration is measured consistently and fairly. The Article's proposed solution draws from new developments in computer modeling simulation and metrics, carbon credits, and global best practices. Further, this Article shares case studies highlighting novel collaborations between nations, private parties, NGOs, and international institutions.","[Marks, Alexia Brunet] Univ Colorado, Law Sch, Law, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Marks, AB (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Law Sch, Law, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",alexia.brunet@colorado.edu,,,,,,222,0,0,15,15,"UNIV DENVER, STURM COLLEGE LAW",DENVER,"2255 E EVANS AVENUE, DENVER, CO 80208 USA",2469-6463,,,DENVER LAW REV,Denver Law Rev.,,2020,97,3,,,,,497,556,,,,,60,Law,Government & Law,MB0KF,WOS:000542297400002,,,,,2021-03-04

Besides, after-sales service is considered that has economic and environmental effects on the supply chain and leads to customers' satisfaction and loyalty. To deal with uncertainty, possibilistic programming is used. Therefore, some parameters of the model are considered as a fuzzy number with a triangular probability distribution. Also, a method based on decision tree and discounted cash flow is utilized to analyze the problem in multiple periods. Furthermore, to validate and show the applicability of the proposed model, a real case study is performed in the polyethylene tanks industry. Finally, the sensitivity analysis is used to check the robustness of the proposed model and framework.

Results indicate that return, financial ratios, dividends, and risk are causal criteria group, which are the most influential determinants for obtaining high benefits with regards to stock portfolio selection in SSE. The free float of stocks is the least influencing criterion among all identified criteria of stock portfolio selection of SSE.

The decision makers should design resilient supply chain networks that can encounter disruptions. This paper develops an integrated resilient model for supplier selection and order allocation. Resilience measures including quality, delivery, technology, continuity, and environmental competences were explored for determining the Resilience Weight (RW) of suppliers. Fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Analytic Network Process (ANP) methods were applied to finding the overall performance of each supplier. Then, the developed mathematical model maximized the overall performance of suppliers while minimizing total cost of network. The proposed mathematical model helps the decision makers to select supplier and allocate the optimum order quantities by considering shortage. Since the disruptive incidents are inevitable events in real-world problems, the impact of disruptions on suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers has been considered in the proposed model. Inherent uncertainties of parameters were taken into account to increase the compatibility of the approach with realistic environments. To tackle the uncertainty and multi-objectiveness of the proposed model, interval method and TH aggregation function were adapted. The proposed model was validated through its application to a real case study of a furniture company. Results demonstrated usefulness and applicability of the proposed model.

In order to support this evaluation process, several studies have proposed the application of artificial intelligence techniques combined with the performance metrics suggested by the SCOR model (Supply Chain Operations Reference). However these propositions present some limitations. While the systems based on Mamdani fuzzy inference do not allow adaptation to the environment of use based on historical performance data, the systems based on artificial neural networks are not adequate to deal with imprecise data and qualitative metrics. In order to overcome these limitations, this paper presents a new approach to support SC performance evaluation based on the combination between the SCOR (R) metrics with an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS). In total, 56 candidate topologies were implemented and assessed using MATLAB. The random subsampling cross-validation method was applied to select the most appropriate topological parameters for each ANFIS model. The mean square error between the target values and the values estimated by each ANFIS model demonstrate its greater accuracy of prediction. In addition, results of the hypothesis tests based on paired samples indicate that the proposed ANFIS models are adequate to support SC performance evaluation. The proposed system can help managers to develop improvement actions plans based on the outcomes of the evaluation process. When compared to previous approaches, it presents advantages such as greater accuracy of prediction, learning ability based on historical data, suitability to support decision making under uncertainty, better interpretability of results, among others.","[Lima-Junior, Francisco Rodrigues] Univ Fed Technol Univ Parana, Dept Management & Econ, Av Sete Setembro 3165, BR-80230901 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Ribeiro Carpinetti, Luiz Cesar] Univ Sao Paulo, Prod Engn Dept, Univ Sao Carlos Sch Engn, Av Trabalhador Sao Carlense 400, BR-13566590 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil","Carpinetti, LCR (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Prod Engn Dept, Univ Sao Carlos Sch Engn, Av Trabalhador Sao Carlense 400, BR-13566590 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.",carpinet@sc.usp.br,"Junior, Francisco Rodrigues Lima/H-6532-2014; Junior, Francisco Rodrigues Lima/AAC-5034-2021; Carpinetti, Luiz C R/D-8974-2012","Junior, Francisco Rodrigues Lima/0000-0001-7053-5519; Junior, Francisco Rodrigues Lima/0000-0001-7053-5519; Carpinetti, Luiz C R/0000-0002-8357-2607",FAPESPFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2016/14618-4]; CAPESCAPES [001],To FAPESP (2016/14618-4) and CAPES (Phd scholarship -code 001) for funding this study.,,66,7,7,5,11,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-8352,1879-0550,,COMPUT IND ENG,Comput.

Generally, a logistic based green supply chain is studied to help multiple stakeholders. Here, we investigate the CLSC to reduce the total transportation cost including carbon emission from a heterogeneous fleet with limited capacity. The forward chain includes manufacturers, depots, distributors/collectors and customers. In the reverse chain, the distributors collect the returned items and sort into three groups through quality-screening and send them to the secondary chain facilities (emerging markets or decomposition centres) which one is fitted. This investigation is contributed by all the demonstrating issues through considering customers' demand, an extensive emission display and the vulnerability of an expanded convey of vehicles. The proposed model addresses four distinct environmental policies viz. cap, carbon tax, cap-and-purchase and cap-and-sale for carbon emission regulations. The model is formulated in the framework of mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP), and an exact approach is employed to obtain the optimal solution. The theoretical results of the model are verified through numerical examples. A comprehensive analysis is presented to monitor the rate of return products and various fleet transporting parameters.","[De, Manoranjan; Giri, B.

In this respect, a novel multi-objective model is developed that addresses the design/redesign wheat supply chain network, which comprises several suppliers, existing silos, candidate locations for establishing silos, flour factories, and demand zones in an uncertain environment. To develop the mathematical model, two additional and essential dimensions of the supply chain including social impact and resiliency are simultaneously considered. This model is the integration of several proper indicators of resiliency, social responsibility dimensions through considering three objective functions to minimize the cost, non-resiliency, and negative impacts of social responsibility. Due to the fact that input parameters taint with inherent uncertainty, a hybrid stochastic fuzzy-robust programming is introduced, and four different hybrid approaches are developed. Finally, to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model as well as solution methodology, a real case study is provided. The obtained results show that simultaneously considering cost, resiliency, and social impacts can significantly assist to improve the performance of the wheat supply chain. Moreover, making trade-off between mentioned measures can help the decision-makers to have the principled preference.","[Hosseini-Motlagh, Seyyed-Mahdi; Samani, Mohammad Reza Ghatreh; Saadi, Firoozeh Abbasi] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Ind Engn, Univ Ave, Tehran 16846, Iran","Hosseini-Motlagh, SM (corresponding author), Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Ind Engn, Univ Ave, Tehran 16846, Iran.",motlagh@iust.ac.ir; mr_samani@ind.iust.ac.ir; F_abbasisaadi@noor.iust.ac.ir,"Hosseini-Motlagh, Seyyed-Mahdi/L-5523-2018","Hosseini-Motlagh, Seyyed-Mahdi/0000-0003-2568-187X",,,,50,6,6,0,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0168-1699,1872-7107,,COMPUT ELECTRON AGR,Comput.

Importance of immediate response in the aftermath of disaster is a crucial part of humanitarian logistic. Resource redistribution among the affected areas makes the optimal allocation in this chaotic situation. The research work has introduced a transportation plan considering the redistribution of resources from those areas which has already acquired relief and restored the normal condition to those areas still not being recovered from the effect of calamities. This research plan is developed to minimize the total cost of the relief operation as well as optimal allocation of the resources. The optimal allocation amidst the disruption of some resource storing points in the aftermath attack of disaster is also one of the key factors of the research. This research work has a great impact for decision-maker to derive an appropriate decision-making in such an anarchic situation of critical humanitarian supply chain. Due to the complexity of disaster, the model is considered in mixed uncertain environment. A numerical study is also performed to show the smooth functioning of the mathematical model assuming the uncertainty by trapezoidal neutrosophic number. Also, trapezoidal fuzzy number is implemented for uncertain parameters of the mathematical model and hereby compared with trapezoidal neutrosophic number.","[Sarma, Deepshikha; Bera, Uttam Kumar] Natl Inst Technol Agartala, Dept Math, Agartala, Tripura, India; [Das, Amrit] Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Adv Sci, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India","Das, A (corresponding author), Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Adv Sci, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India.",deepshikhasarma4@gmail.com; amrit.das@vit.ac.in; bera_uttam@yahoo.co.in,,,,,,58,3,3,1,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1432-7643,1433-7479,,SOFT COMPUT,Soft Comput.,JAN,2020,24,1,,,SI,,65,82,,10.1007/s00500-019-04287-7,,,18,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",Computer Science,KG1EJ,WOS:000509684200006,,,,,2021-03-04

Our paper examines the relationship between organizational culture (OC) and open innovation performance (OIP) of SMEs and the mediating effect of organizational sustainability (OS). Our investigation of 300 SMEs from different business industries in Thailand and China reveals that organizational sustainability significantly intervenes in the interaction of organizational culture and open innovation performance. From the findings, it is established that organizations should set robust and appropriate strategies for organizational sustainability to have excellent innovation outputs in SMEs' performance. This paper also shows the significant effect of organizational culture on organizational sustainability in that cultural characteristics maintain the core business competencies in terms of marketing, operations, customer orientation, capital management, and monitoring & evaluation for sustainability. Such elements of organizational sustainability operate in a significant mediator contribution to SMEs' performance to manage open innovation. As a practical contribution, this paper suggests managers realize the crucial elements of organizational culture, such as leadership, teamwork, and organizational climate, to improve performance by combining organizational sustainability in their strategic decisions made during the open innovation processes.","[Srisathan, W.

Preemptive measures are needed for dealing with mutable risks and vulnerabilities to safeguard robust supply chain systems. Supply chain risk management (SCRM) connotes a set of risk management responses essentially instigated to confront supply chain risks. As supply chain risks are intertwined, one resilient strategy for risk mitigation can moderate several supply chain risks. A complex decision making problem involving twelve major supply chain risks and twenty one resilient strategies for risk mitigation have been acknowledged in this research with archetypal focus on electronics manufacturing supply chains. A combination of Multi criteria decision aid (MCDA) and artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in decision making of complex real world problems. A decision support model incorporating an amalgamation of grey theory and layered analytic network process (ANP) has been employed for quantifying various resilient strategies for risk mitigation. The proposed model was also applied in a practical setting taking a case study of an electronics manufacturing company. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted to ensure the robustness of obtained results. The combined methodology proposed in this research could be effectively used by top management, to pigeonhole the resilient supply chain strategies for better managing their supply chains.","[Rajesh, R.] ABV Indian Inst Informat Technol & Management, Management Div, Gwalior 474015, India","Rajesh, R (corresponding author), ABV Indian Inst Informat Technol & Management, Management Div, Gwalior 474015, India.",rajesh@iiitm.ac.in,"Rajesh, R./K-9650-2014","Rajesh, R./0000-0002-4231-0539",,,,89,10,10,3,14,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0952-1976,1873-6769,,ENG APPL ARTIF INTEL,Eng.

However, the protection of the environment is one of the main factors that should be considered based on environmental protection regulations of countries. In this paper, environmental concerns are considered in formulating a mathematical model to design and configure a multi-period, multi-product, multi-echelon green meat supply chain network. We develop a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming formulation to optimize three objectives simultaneously: minimization of the total cost, minimization of the total CO2 emissions released from transportation, and maximization of the total capacity utilization of facilities. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed optimization model, we design a green meat supply chain network for Southern Ontario, Canada. A solution approach based on augmented epsilon-constraint method is employed to solve the proposed model. As a result, a set of Pareto-optimal solutions is obtained. The set of Pareto-optimal solutions gives decision-makers the opportunity to make a trade-off between economic, environmental, and capacity utilization objectives. Our example shows that it is possible to keep emissions reasonably low without incurring high total costs. Finally, the impacts of uncertainty on the proposed model are investigated using several decision trees. Optimization of a food supply chain, particularly a meat supply chain, based on multiple objectives under uncertainty using decision trees is a new approach in the literature.","[Mohebalizadehgashti, Fatemeh; Amin, Saman Hassanzadeh] Ryerson Univ, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Zolfagharinia, Hossein] Ryerson Univ, Ted Rogers Sch Management, Toronto, ON, Canada","Amin, SH (corresponding author), Ryerson Univ, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Toronto, ON, Canada.",fmohebal@ryerson.ca; h.zolfagharinia@ryerson.ca; saman.amin@ryerson.ca,,"Hassanzadeh Amin, Saman/0000-0001-6173-7530","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [RGPIN-2017-04434, RGPIN2017-04481]",The authors would like to thank the editor and reviewers for the great comments that improved.; the quality of the paper significantly.

However, the data collected and processed by loT systems especially the ones with centralized control are vulnerable to availability, integrity, and privacy threats. Hence, we present PrivySharing, a blockchain-based innovative framework for privacy-preserving and secure loT data sharing in a smart city environment. The proposed scheme is distinct from existing strategies on many aspects. The data privacy is preserved by dividing the blockchain network into various channels, where every channel comprises a finite number of authorized organizations and processes a specific type of data such as health, smart car, smart energy or financial details. Moreover, access to users' data within a channel is controlled by embedding access control rules in the smart contracts. In addition, data within a channel is further isolated and secured by using private data collection and encryption respectively. Likewise, the REST API that enables clients to interact with the blockchain network has dual security in the form of an API Key and OAuth 2.0. The proposed solution conforms to some of the significant requirements outlined in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. We also present a system of reward in the form of a digital token named PrivyCoin for users sharing their data with stakeholders/third parties. Lastly, the experimental outcomes advocate that a multi-channel blockchain scales well as compared to a single-channel blockchain system. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper is an attempt to study the use of BC technology and a try to develop efficient sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) rather than the inefficient design of supply chain management (SCM). Important variables related to BC are identified from the literature after going through discussion with academician and industry experts. These variables are further analyzed and modeled using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Fuzzy-Decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL). PCA is applied to form the principal factor from these identified variables based on possible correlation. Although, the application of Fuzzy-DEMATEL is adopted to identify major causes that help to achieve sustainable supply chain (SSC) after integration of BC technology. The proposed integrated (incorporated) approach of PCA and Fuzzy-DEMATEL found six major causes namely Data safety and Decentralization, Accessibility, Laws and Policy, Documentation, Data management, and Quality. This study is revolving around the integrated approach of two streams namely BC-related Information technology and SC from Operations. This research represents the significant role of causes, which leads to the integration of BC with the SC resulting in achieving sustainability.

With the scope of this paper, selection of most desirable recycling partner is an important task and complex decision for managers of electronic companies. This paper presents a three-phase novel hybrid methodology for partner selection by electronic companies. The first phase involves extensive literature for identification of green competencies (GC) criteria and then finalize seven main criteria and forty-eight sub-criteria with experts' opinion, the second phase involves fuzzy AHP method which is used to calculate relative weight and rank the selection criteria and third phase involves ranking of recycling partners' alternative with respect to GC criteria weights using novel VIKOR. Sensitivity analysis is also conducted to check the robustness and stability of the framework. The results indicate that resource and environmental management capabilities (REC), green core competencies (GCC), and regulatory obligation and risk compliance (RRC) are the key criteria for partner selection process.

In order to implement a sustainable strategy, it is necessary to assess the sustainability performance. Nevertheless, this still represents a relevant gap in the literature and practice. There are a number of frameworks and tools for sustainability performance assessment. Most of them are based on a set of indicators. However, in many corporations the sets are applied and kept disaggregated. Due to this deficiency, aggregated sustainability assessment approaches are often explored by researchers and practitioners. One of the main approaches is the use of multi criteria decision making methods which transform multiple indicator values to a single dimension. Since there are many complex interdependencies among the used sustainability key performance indicators and their relations are uncertain, Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP) appears to be an appropriate tool for aggregated assessing the sustainability performance. The aim of this paper is to develop and verify a methodology for aggregated sustainability performance assessment of an industrial corporation using the FANP approach. Based on analysis of the existing FANP approaches and discussion of their advantages and disadvantages, Logarithmic Fuzzy Preference Programming Methodology was selected for this purpose. Our developed methodology provides a comprehensive aggregated sustainability performance assessment system based on combining three evaluation methods (basic evaluation, trend evaluation, and categorization), and Action matrix, which defines appropriate corrective actions level to achieve the sustainability performance targets. A case study from metallurgical industry was used to verify the developed methodology and to identify critical points and recommendations for its implementation. (C) 2019 The Authors.

The quantities of emergency commodities are prepared and stocked at relief centers in advance for possible disasters. In the event of a disaster, due to the different disaster severities and uncertain environment, some relief centers inevitably have surplus commodities, whereas some relief centers are still unmet. To use any surplus commodities effectively, a multi-commodity rebalancing process is necessary to rebalance the commodities among relief centers. However, various uncertainties make the multi-commodity rebalancing process extremely challenging, including uncertain demand and transportation-network availability. By recognizing those practical uncertainties, a bi-level stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is proposed to formulate this multi-commodity rebalancing problem. The upper-level objective is to minimize the total dissatisfaction level, which is measured by the expected total weighted unsatisfied demand, and the lower-level objective is to minimize the expected total transportation time. Finally, a case study on the Great Sichuan Earthquake in China is implemented; their results show that the proposed model facilitates effective decision-making in the practice of multi-commodity rebalancing.","[Gao, Xuehong] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Busan, South Korea","Gao, XH (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Busan, South Korea.",gao2016@pnu.edu,"Gao, Xuehong/AAG-8546-2019",,National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government [NRF-2017R1A2B4004169]; China-Korea cooperation program; NRF [NRF-2018K2A9A2A06019662],This research was partially supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant funded by the Korea government (NRF-2017R1A2B4004169) and the China-Korea cooperation program managed by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the NRF (NRF-2018K2A9A2A06019662).,,65,1,1,10,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0254-5330,1572-9338,,ANN OPER RES,Ann.

Accelerating globalization further exacerbate regional inequities hidden behind the global supply chains. Therefore, the energy use of construction industry embodied in interregional trade needs to be revealed considering the regional disparities. China, as the largest developing country, suffers from massive spending on infrastructure construction. Therefore, investigating the interactions between China's construction industry and the rest of the world is imperative. Previous researches fail to provide a holistic view of energy interactions induced by the global construction industry. This study details the global supply chain of the construction industry by merging 31 Chinese regions into the complex global trading network, which is beneficial for making fair energy reduction strategies. Results show that both embodied energy use and direct energy use exhibit a strong positive linear correlation with GDP. Interregional trade increases the inequality of energy use in the global construction industry, in which 81.67% of the regions possess an energy inequality indicator of the construction industry over 0.80, thus proving that the construction industry consumes a large amount of nonlocal energy. There is no significant relationship between the embodied intensity and GDP, whereas a weak linear correlation exists between intensity and embodied energy use. In China, Shanxi, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia represent a high intensity. There is a weak positive correlation between urbanization rate and embodied energy values. The findings of this research are critical in understanding the connections between province-level construction activities and the global trading network, which is beneficial for customizing and prioritizing policy recommendations for sustainable development of the global construction industry.","[Guo, Shan] Renmin Univ China, Sch Publ Adm & Policy, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Shupeng] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yunhao] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yunhao] Renmin Univ China, Sch Informat Resource Management, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Hong, Jingke; Tang, Miaohan] Chongqing Univ, Sch Management Sci & Real Estate, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xiaofang] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Econ Sch, Wuhan 430073, Hubei, Peoples R China","Hong, JK (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Sch Management Sci & Real Estate, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China.; Wu, XF (corresponding author), Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Econ Sch, Wuhan 430073, Hubei, Peoples R China.",shan.guo@ruc.edu.cn; koala2017200218@ruc.edu.cn; huyunhao@ruc.edu.cn; hongjingke@cqu.edu.cn; xfwu@zuel.edu.cn; tangmiaohan@cqu.edu.cn,"Wu, Xiaofang/O-7253-2014",,"Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71801023, 71804194, 71701087]; fund for building world-class universities (disciplines) of Renmin University of China; Support for Oversea Talent Scientific Research Funding; Chongqing Science & Technology CommissionNatural Science Foundation Project of CQ CSTC [cstc2018jcyjAX0099]; Research Grants Council of Hong KongHong Kong Research Grants Council [15276916]","This study has been supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71801023, Grant No. 71804194, and Grant No. 71701087), fund for building world-class universities (disciplines) of Renmin University of China, the Support for Oversea Talent Scientific Research Funding established by Renmin University of China, Chongqing Science & Technology Commission (No. cstc2018jcyjAX0099) and the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong (No. 15276916).",,41,14,14,19,54,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-2619,1872-9118,,APPL ENERG,Appl.

The results from FAHP analysis were further confirmed by conducting semi-structured interviews in five electronics parts/components manufacturing organizations. This study also prioritized theoretical drivers of SSCM adoption based on the consideration of three organizational theory perspectives - Institutional Theory; Resource-Based View, and; Social Network Theory. The results indicate that the economic dimension was the most important measure for implementing SSCM while sustainable design was the most important SSCM practice for achieving the TBL. The study also found that Institutional Theory is the most important theoretical driver for implementing SSCM.

Design/methodology/approach This paper combines a literature review on gaming as a research method with an analysis of requirements for humanitarian logistics research methods. Starting from this theoretical framework, the authors develop a design thinking approach that highlights how games can be used for different research purposes. To illustrate the approach, the authors develop two different game set-ups that are of increasing fidelity and complexity. Finally, the authors discuss the results of the evaluation of both approaches, reflect on the design choices and provide recommendations for research and practice. Findings Gaming is a suitable research method to explore and analyse behaviour and decisions in emergent settings that require team work and collaborative problem solving. Especially when safety and security concerns may hinder access and experimentation on site, gaming can offer a realistic and engaging quasi-experimental environment. The aspects of engagement and realism also make gaming a suitable tool to combine training and research. Originality/value Although the use of games has attracted some attention in commercial supply chain management and crisis response, there is no systematic overview of gaming as a research method in humanitarian logistics.

These trends require the organizations to rethink their approaches to supply chain management, so that they could cope with the upcoming challenges. This research paper focuses on the ways a logistics cluster can provide the abilities to share information and thus improve the forecasting accuracy. The main novelty of the paper has been to work out a collaborative technological strategy which promotes information sharing in order to improve forecasting accuracy and inventory control for better alignment of demand and supply. The secondary contribution of the article is the determination of the influence of information sharing on forecasting accuracy in different market sizes, types and the consideration of consumer integration. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis has been completed to identify the optimal size of the logistics cluster the determination of which provides support when implementing the proposed strategy in practice. For the results validation we have implemented an agent-based model of the food supply chain. Our results have confirmed that information sharing increases the forecasting accuracy in multiple scenarios. Moreover, consumer integration is beneficial in a perfect competition market; however, its positive effect is less significant in an oligopoly market. These findings should be taken into consideration when developing e-commerce business strategy and forming logistics clusters. The usage of machine learning algorithms in the forecasting process provides adaptation capabilities for the supply chain members. The adaptation emerges as system resilience and it improves the alignment of demand and supply, reduces food waste levels and maintains higher nutrition value. The proposed strategy can ensure a long-term sustainable development to logistics cluster members. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, this paper proposed an improved susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model combined with a complex network model and an optimised approach to the selection of risk control strategies to explore three issues: first, the dynamic change and trend of risk transmission; second, the relationships and impacts of different suppliers and structure of the supply chain on risk transmission; and third, the selection of a risk control strategy within the transnational supply chain. A numerical analysis and an example of a risk control strategy selection are conducted to reveal four properties of risk transmission within the transnational supply chain.

The implementation of bio-based technologies mostly takes place on a regional scale. Therefore, from a regional perspective, a key question revolves around what main challenges are associated with technological developments that could catalyze the implementation of sustainable bioeconomy regions. In this study, a cross-cutting analysis was carried out to determine these challenges. First, interviews were conducted with industry practitioners and scientists working in the bioeconomy field. These interviews were supplemented with a literature review to determine the status quo of bioeconomy strategies and their implementation, particularly on a regional level. A multidisciplinary workshop was then organized to identify the most relevant challenges in the short- and mid-term associated with establishing bioeconomy regions. The results show that there is a three-pronged challenge in innovative technological development from a regional perspective: (1) Resources: The establishment of sustainable regional feedstock strategies and supplies for supporting the bio-industrial sector; (2) collaborators: The establishment of a regional critical mass by fostering supply chain clusters and networks; and (3) neighbors: Understanding the local dynamics of societal trends and preferences and social acceptance of bio-technologies and their representative bio-based products.","[Bezama, Alberto; O'Keeffe, Sinead; Thraen, Daniela] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Bioenergy, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Ingrao, Carlo] Kore Univ Enna, Fac Engn & Architecture, I-94100 Enna, Italy; [Thraen, Daniela] Deutsch Biomasseforsch Zentrum DBFZ, Bioenergy Syst Dept, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany","Bezama, A (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Bioenergy, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",alberto.bezama@ufz.de; carlo.ingrao@unikore.it; sinead.o-keeffe@ufz.de; daniela.thraen@ufz.de,"Ingrao, Carlo/K-5675-2014; Thran, Daniela/E-7672-2015","Ingrao, Carlo/0000-0002-3359-2458; Thran, Daniela/0000-0002-6573-6401; Bezama, Alberto/0000-0002-0971-2798; O'Keeffe, Sinead/0000-0003-0465-8822",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the project Leading Edge Cluster BioeconomyFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [FZK 031A078A]; Helmholtz Association of German Research Centers through the Program Energy System 2050-A Contribution of the Research Field Energy,"This work has been financed by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the project Leading Edge Cluster Bioeconomy (FZK 031A078A), as well as by the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centers through the Program Energy System 2050-A Contribution of the Research Field Energy.",,104,0,0,1,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC 2,2019,11,24,,,,,,,7235,10.3390/su11247235,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KC0TQ,WOS:000506901400021,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

Firstly, CSFs and performance outcomes are extracted by conducting exploratory factor analysis using SPSS software. Then, the relationships between CLSC CSFs and performance outcomes are empirically tested by Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) approach, using the data collected from 138 professionals working in remanufacturing, refurbishing and recycling operations in North American manufacturing organisations. Empirical analysis demonstrates that CSFs, 'environmental concerns', 'sustainable production' and 'product design and collection' have a significant positive effect on environmental performance. Results also validate the significant positive effect of CSFs, 'demand and inventory management' and 'raw material prices' on economic performance. In our knowledge, this is the first study that examines the impact of CLSC CSFs on performance outcomes.

The sustainability measure of MFT can be viewed as a lever to uplift freight transportation sustainability. The MFT sustainability assessment involves several subjective criteria, incomplete criteria information, and vagueness in the group decision-making process. To keep above nature of the decision-making problem, this paper use intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) based MCDM framework for sustainability assessment. The IF method is suitable for incorporating experts importance degree in decision-making problem. The proposed sustainability framework includes social, technical, economic, environmental, and political (STEEP) sustainability dimension for assessment of MFT location. The framework considers twenty-five subcriteria, including four new criteria for location assessment. The importance of STEEP criterion is computed by employing IF-analytic hierarchy process (IF-AHP). The proposed framework is validated with a case of Eastern dedicated freight corridor (EDFC) of India. The sustainability assessment of four alternative locations is measured by employing an IF based TOPSIS method. The computation result of the considered case shows that technical sustainability is the most important criteria for location selection, followed by economic criteria. The experts' varying importance based sensitivity analysis is the novelty of this paper. The sensitivity analysis depicts the robustness of the proposed framework. The managerial and theoretical implications of the study are presented.

From the perspective of computational logistics, we propose the container terminal logistics generalized computing architecture (CTL-GCA) by the migration, integration, and fusion of the abstract hierarchy, design philosophy, execution mechanism, and automatic principles of computer organization, computing architecture, and operating system. The CTL-GCA is supposed to provide the problem-oriented exploration and exploitation elementary frameworks for the abstraction, automation, and analysis of green production at container terminals. The CTL-GCA is intended to construct, evaluate, and improve the solution to planning, scheduling, and decision at container terminals, which all are nondeterministic polynomial hard problems. Subsequently, the logistics generalized computational pattern recognition and performance evaluation of a practical container terminal service case study is launched by the qualitative and quantitative approach from the sustainable perspective of green production. The case study demonstrates the application, utilization, exploitation, and exploration of CTL-GCA preliminarily, and finds the unsustainable patterns of production at the container terminal. From the above, we can draw the following conclusions. For one thing, the CTL-GCA makes a definition of the abstract and automatic running architecture of logistics generalized computation for container terminals (LGC-CT), which provides an original framework for the design and implementation of control and decision mechanism and algorithm. For another, the CTL-GCA can help us to investigate the roots of DNCC thoroughly, and then the CTL-GCA makes for conducting the efficient and sustainable running pattern recognition of LGC-CT. It is supposed to provide a favorable guidance and supplement to define, design, and implement the agile, efficient, sustainable, and robust task scheduling and resource allocation for container terminals by computational logistics whether in the strategy level or the tactical one.","[Song, Guanggang] Shandong Prov Commun Planning & Design Inst, Waterway Transportat Planning & Design Branch, Jinan 250031, Peoples R China; [Li, Bin; He, Yuqing] Fujian Univ Technol, Sch Transportat, Fuzhou 350118, Peoples R China","Li, B (corresponding author), Fujian Univ Technol, Sch Transportat, Fuzhou 350118, Peoples R China.",suancaiyupian@163.com; whutmse2007_lb@126.com; heyuqing011@163.com,"Li, Bin/AAY-8338-2020","Li, Bin/0000-0001-9322-1723",Humanities and Social Science Programming Foundation of Ministry of Education in China [19YJA630031]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province in ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Fujian Province [2017J01496]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University of Fujian Province in ChinaProgram for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET) [2015-54]; Scientific Research Foundation of Fujian University of Technology in China [GY-Z160125]; Traffic Science and Technology Project of Shandong Province in China [2016B35],"This research was funded by the Humanities and Social Science Programming Foundation of Ministry of Education in China, grant number 19YJA630031; the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province in China, grant number 2017J01496; the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University of Fujian Province in China, grant number 2015-54; the Scientific Research Foundation of Fujian University of Technology in China, grant number GY-Z160125; and the Traffic Science and Technology Project of Shandong Province in China, grant number 2016B35.",,60,0,0,2,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2078-2489,,INFORMATION,Information,DEC,2019,10,12,,,,,,,383,10.3390/info10120383,,,24,"Computer Science, Information Systems",Computer Science,KC7FZ,WOS:000507340400023,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

Such systems are often composed of a modular setup exhibiting an instrument accommodating rather conventional actuation, detection and control units which interfaces with a fluidically integrated Lab-on-a-Chip device handling (bio-)sample(s) and reagents. As the complex network of tiny channels, chambers and surface-functionalised zones can typically not be properly cleaned and regenerated, these microfluidic chips are mostly devised as single-use disposables. The availability of cost-efficient materials and associated structuring, functionalisation and assembly schemes thus represents a key ingredient along the commercialisation pipeline and will be a first focus of this work. Furthermore, and owing to their innate variability, investigations on biosamples mostly require the acquisition of statistically relevant datasets. Consequently, intermediate numbers of consistently performing chips are already needed during application development; to mitigate the potential pitfalls of technology migration and to facilitate regulatory compliance of the end products, manufacture of such pilot series should widely follow larger-scale production schemes. To expedite and de-risk the development of commercially relevant microfluidic systems towards high Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), we illustrate a streamlined, manufacturing-centric platform approach employing the paradigms of tolerance-forgiving Design-for-Manufacture (DfM) and Readiness for Scale-up (RfS) from prototyping to intermediate pilot series and eventual mass fabrication. Learning from mature industries, we further propose pursuing a platform approach incorporating aspects of standardisation in terms of specification, design rules and testing methods for materials, components, interfaces, and operational procedures; this coherent strategy will foster the emergence of dedicated commercial supply chains and also improve the economic viability of Lab-on-a-Chip systems often targeting smaller niche markets by synergistically bundling technology development.","[Ducree, Jens] Dublin City Univ, Sch Phys Sci, FPC, Fraunhofer Project Ctr Embedded Bioanalyt Syst, Dublin 9, Ireland","Ducree, J (corresponding author), Dublin City Univ, Sch Phys Sci, FPC, Fraunhofer Project Ctr Embedded Bioanalyt Syst, Dublin 9, Ireland.",jens.ducree@dcu.ie,"Ducree, Jens/M-4264-2014","Ducree, Jens/0000-0002-0366-1897",Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)Science Foundation Ireland; Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft under the SFI Strategic Partnership Programme [16/SPP/3321],"This publication has emanated from research conducted with the financial support of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) and Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft under the SFI Strategic Partnership Programme, Grant Number 16/SPP/3321.",,46,1,1,3,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-666X,,MICROMACHINES-BASEL,Micromachines,DEC,2019,10,12,,,,,,,886,10.3390/mi10120886,,,12,"Chemistry, Analytical; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Instruments & Instrumentation",Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Instruments & Instrumentation,KC7FA,WOS:000507337900074,31861126,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2021-03-04

In supply chain, carbon emissions are seen light away from the procurement of raw materials till the distribution of finished goods through logistics. Hence, there is strong need to fix carbon emissions and to make existing supply chain an environmentally sustainable supply chain to gain environmental disaster relief. This paper primarily focuses on minimizing carbon emissions in the raw material procurement and its logistics using a cap-and-trade method. In the raw material procurement and logistics, the carbon emission is caused during the ordering, transporting and holding the procured items from various suppliers. The paper aims to model sustainability-resilience link at the supply chain design level through the procurement and logistics of raw material which is considered as the primary stage of any supply chain. A dynamic non-linear mixed integer model featuring an environmental sustainability through cap-and-trade method of carbon emission is proposed that can be used to design sustainable procurement logistics for disaster resilient supply chain management. The proposed model in the paper is referred as SPL_DRSCM (sustainable procurement and logistics for disaster resilient supply chain management) and is validated through illustrations. Important useful managerial and practical insights are obtained from set of five different deterministic data sets. Proposed model for SPL_DRSCM MINLP shows significant cost saving while optimizing procurement and its logistics under carbon emission constraint.

The water supply network is one of the grids that has been given additional attention due to the problem of waste caused by water leakage, usually requiring rapid detection for fast intervention to prevent high costs. With centralised information coming from the grid, like the measurement of pressure and flow, it is revealed that anomaly detection could be an important tool for quick automatic detection without needing permanent analysis by a human operator. However, there is a need for a more robust approach, especially when noisy data are present. In this paper, we propose the implementation of a new approach based on a hybrid expectation maximization (EM) Gaussian model combined with a t-distribution mixture. This approach is compared to both a pure EM Gaussian mixture model and a t-distribution mixture model that can use labelled data or not. Each EM algorithm was applied to real data acquired from a water supply grid with the aim of automatically detecting water leaks. Using the newly developed approach, the results show that detection is both possible and more accurate for this type of database.","[Duarte, Daniel P.; Nogueira, Rogerio N.; Bifro, Lucia B.] Inst Telecomunicacoes Polo Aveiro, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Duarte, Daniel P.] Aveiro Univ, Dept Phys, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal","Duarte, DP (corresponding author), Inst Telecomunicacoes Polo Aveiro, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.; Duarte, DP (corresponding author), Aveiro Univ, Dept Phys, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.",dduarte@av.it.pt,"Duarte, Daniel A.

We propose a novel data-driven Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization model for hedging against uncertainty in the optimal network design. Instead of assuming perfect knowledge of probability distribution for uncertain parameters, we construct a data-driven ambiguity set of candidate distributions based on the Wasserstein metric, which is utilized to quantify their distances from the data-based empirical distribution. Equipped with this ambiguity set, the two-stage distributionally robust optimization model not only accommodates the sequential decision making at design and operational stages, but also hedges against the distributional ambiguity arising from finite amount of uncertainty data. A solution algorithm is further developed to solve the resulting two-stage distributionally robust mixed-integer nonlinear program. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we present a case study of a biomass with agricultural waste-to-energy network including 216 technologies and 172 compounds. Computational results show that the data-driven Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization approach has a better out-of-sample performance in terms of a 5.7% lower average cost and a 37.1% smaller cost standard deviation compared with the conventional stochastic programming method.","[Ning, Chao; You, Fengqi] Cornell Univ, Robert Frederick Smith Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [You, Fengqi] Cornell Univ, Atkinson Ctr Sustainable Future, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","You, FQ (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Robert Frederick Smith Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",fengqi.you@cornell.edu,"You, Fengqi/B-5040-2011","You, Fengqi/0000-0001-9609-4299",National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER AwardNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [CBET-1643244]; Cornell University's David R.

Biodiesel is an expensive fuel and can be used as an additive to reduce levels of particulates, carbon monoxide, and other pollutants released from diesel fuel. The proportion of biodiesel in the produced fuel can be planned and controlled according to the conditions. This study forms a comprehensive multi-objective-period model for designing a biodiesel development program and compares different biodiesel blends and primary resources. The study considers B5, B10, B20, B40, and B100 along with diesel as the candidate fuels for demand fulfillment; furthermore, model considers waste cooking oil, soya, sunflower, and rapeseed as the primary resources. The objectives are the facilities' implementation costs and environmental effects minimization. The decision variables are the capacity planning and the facility location variables. The exact Pareto set is obtained by using the augmented e-constraint method. The study considers economic and environment objectives interactions. Based on the results, B5 and B40 are the most appropriate options in the exact Pareto set; moreover, the results show the advantages of this approach to select the most appropriate fuels and primary resources according to different conditions during the studied period.","[Hosseinalizadeh, Ramin] Kharazmi Univ, Fac Engn, Ind Engn Dept, Tehran, Iran; [Khamseh, Alireza Arshadi] Istanbul Gelisim Univ, Fac Econ Adm & Social Sci, Dept Int Logist & Transportat, Istanbul, Turkey; [Akhlaghi, Mohammad Mahdi] Niroo Res Inst, Renewable Energy Dept, Tehran, Iran","Khamseh, AA (corresponding author), Istanbul Gelisim Univ, Fac Econ Adm & Social Sci, Dept Int Logist & Transportat, Istanbul, Turkey.",Ramin.h_alizadeh@yahoo.com; akhamseh@gelisim.edu.tr; Makhlaghi@nri.ac.ir,,"Hosseinalizadeh, Ramin/0000-0002-3469-515X",,,,66,2,2,1,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-1388,2213-1396,,SUSTAIN ENERGY TECHN,Sustain.

While the extant literature on supply chains acknowledges this trend, it fails to inform comprehensively on the concept of stringent environmental requirement and its consequences. The purpose of this paper is to investigate this concept and explore how such requirements may translate into supplier environmental performance. Design/methodology/approach Qualitative methodology was adopted by the study and data were collected through conducting eight case studies in the Bangladesh ready-made garment (RMG) industry. Findings A number of factors were found to be influencing suppliers' perception of stringency, such as uncertainty relating to the newness and deadline of buyers' environmental requirements, the complexity of implementing the requirements, and the use of buyer-specific frameworks. The research also shows that suppliers' efforts in building environmental capability play a vital role in dealing with stringent environmental requirements. Originality/value This research establishes evidence for the relatively new phenomenon of stringent environmental requirements, and develops a theoretical framework to demonstrate the relationships among the critical determinants relevant to this phenomenon.","[Shumon, Rezaul; Halim, Zaheed; Rahman, Shams; Ahsan, Kamrul] RMIT Univ, Sch Business IT & Logist, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Rahman, S (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Business IT & Logist, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",shams.rahman@rmit.edu.au,,"Rahman, Shams/0000-0001-5856-7753; Shumon, Rezaul/0000-0003-1001-6383; Ahsan, Kamrul/0000-0002-9757-1285",,,,69,0,0,2,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0960-0035,1758-664X,,INT J PHYS DISTR LOG,Int.

The anaerobic digestion process is the industry standard technology for biogas production due to its lowered energy consumption and its reliance on microbiology. Even in such an environmental-friendly process, liquid digestate is still produced from the remains of digested bio-feedstock and will require treatment. With unsuitable treatment procedure for liquid digestate, the mass of bio-feedstock can potentially escape the circular supply chain within the economy. This paper recommends the implementation of evaporator systems to provide a sustainable liquid digestate treating mechanism within the economy. Studied evaporator systems are represented by vacuum evaporation in combination with ammonia scrubber, stripping and reverse osmosis. Nevertheless, complex multi-dimensional decisions should be made by stakeholders before implementing such systems. Our work utilizes a novel techno-economics model to study the techno-economics robustness in implementing recent state-of-art vacuum evaporation systems with exploitation of waste heat from combined heat and power (CHP) units in biogas plants (BGP). To take into the account the stochasticity of the real world and robustness of the analysis, we used the Monte-Carlo simulation technique to generate more than 20,000 of different possibilities for the implementation of the evaporation system. Favourable decision pathways are then selected using a novel methodology which utilizes the artificial neural network and a hyper-optimized decision tree classifier. Two pathways that give the highest probability of providing a fast payback period are identified. Descriptive statistics are also used to analyse the distributions of decision parameters that lead to success in implementing the evaporator system. The results highlighted that integration of evaporation system are favourable when transport costs and incentives for CHP units are large and while feed-in tariffs for electricity production and specific investment costs are low. The result of this work is expected to pave the way for BGP stakeholders and decision makers in implementing liquid digestate treating technologies within the currently existing infrastructure.

In the leather footwear industry of Bangladesh, it is possible to recycle and reuse waste, meaning a reverse logistics system could increase return-on-investment and give a competitive advantage. To date, studies on barriers to RL implementation have been conducted in other countries and in other domains, leaving a research gap in RL barrier analyses in the leather footwear industry. There are many obstacles to implementing RL in a developing country like Bangladesh; examining these barriers is a crucial research issue. This paper identifies RL barriers through (1) an extent literature review, (2) advice from Bangladeshi industry experts under the Delphi study, and (3) ranking RL barriers using the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process. The results indicate that, of the barriers investigated, the 'knowledge and support' category seems to be most critical. A lack of interest and support from top-level management-related to 'knowledge and support' issues-appears to be the major obstacle for RL implementation in the Bangladeshi leather footwear industry. These findings will help the Bangladeshi leather footwear industry, as well as other industries in Bangladesh, to understand the nature of each barrier and overcome the complexity of RL implementation in supply chains. This study will also assist decision-makers in making certain strategic policies. Future studies may contribute to the life cycle assessment and engineering of recycled and reused footwear.","[Moktadir, Md Abdul] Univ Dhaka, Inst Leather Engn & Technol, Dept Leather Prod Engn, Dhaka 1209, Bangladesh; [Rahman, Towfique; Ali, Syed Mithun] Bangladesh Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Ind & Prod Engn, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh; [Nahar, Nazmun] Amer Int Univ Bangladesh, Dept Operat & Supply Chain Management, Dhaka 1213, Bangladesh; [Paul, Sanjoy Kumar] Univ Technol Sydney, UTS Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Paul, SK (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, UTS Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",abdulmoktadir2010@gmail.com; towfique.rahman.bd@gmail.com; syed.mithun@gmail.com; nazmun.nahar.n84@gmail.com; Sanjoy.paul@uts.edu.au,"Paul, Sanjoy/K-2618-2019; Ali, Syed Mithun/AAF-8674-2020; Moktadir, Abdul/J-1881-2019","Paul, Sanjoy/0000-0001-9523-179X; Ali, Syed Mithun/0000-0002-4302-5991; Moktadir, Abdul/0000-0003-1852-7815",,,,95,3,3,3,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0254-5330,1572-9338,,ANN OPER RES,Ann.

An airport can also be viewed as the center of a hydrogen ecosystem, around which multiple hydrogen users could be clustered, with cost sharing of hydrogen production and storage occurring among users. The main novelty of the present work is the design of a hydrogen infrastructure irrigated by the airport ecosystem that satisfies the airport ecosystem energy needs. For this purpose, the model development is based on a multiobjective optimization framework designed to consider four echelons: energy sources, hydrogen production, transportation, and storage. The multiperiod problem is then solved using the epsilon-constraint method. Two objective functions are involved, that is, the total daily cost (TDC) of the network and an environmental indicator based on the global warming potential. The second innovative contribution is to model the demand uncertainty using fuzzy concepts for a hydrogen supply chain design. Because hydrogen demand is one the most significant parameters, the uncertainty of the demand has been considered using a proposed fuzzy linear programming strategy. The solutions are compared with the original crisp model, giving more robustness to the proposed approach. This work has been performed in the framework of the Hyport meta-project and, in particular, within the H-2 modeling project. This paper focuses on a hydrogen airport ecosystem located in the department of Hautes-Pyrenees (France). However, the developed methodology could be extended to other hydrogen ecosystems for which deployment involves a multiperiod multi-objective formulation under an uncertain demand.","[Robles, Jesus Ochoa; Billoud, Marialis Giraud; Azzaro-Pantel, Catherine] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Lab Genie Chim, Toulouse, France; [Robles, Jesus Ochoa; Billoud, Marialis Giraud; Azzaro-Pantel, Catherine] Toulouse INP, ENSIACET, 4 Allee Emile Monso,BP 44362, F-31432 Toulouse 4, France; [Alfonso Aguilar-Lasserre, Alberto] Inst Tecnol Orizaba, Oriente 9, Orizaba 94320, Veracruz, Mexico","Azzaro-Pantel, C (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Lab Genie Chim, Toulouse, France.; Azzaro-Pantel, C (corresponding author), Toulouse INP, ENSIACET, 4 Allee Emile Monso,BP 44362, F-31432 Toulouse 4, France.",Catherine.AzzaroPantel@ensiacet.fr,,,,,,24,2,2,2,11,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",2168-0485,,,ACS SUSTAIN CHEM ENG,ACS Sustain.

Considering the heterogeneous roles of enterprises, new metrics based on a new proposed sub-network concept are presented to evaluate resilience. Using a computer simulation, the resilience of the SN generated by the model proposed in this paper is compared with that of other models, and the results indicate that (i) the proposed model can be tuned to generate a desired resilient network; (ii) the proposed metrics capture the resilience requirements of the SN very well; (iii) the more uniform the distribution of the enterprises, the more resilient the corresponding SN; and (iv) the higher the values of alpha and beta, the lower the SN resilience, and beta affects the resilience more than alpha does.","[Shi, Xiao-qiu; Long, Wei; Li, Yan-yan; Deng, Ding-shan; Wei, Yong-lai; Liu, Hua-guo] Sichuan Univ, Sch Mfg Sci & Engn, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Shi, XQ (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Sch Mfg Sci & Engn, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",shixiaoqiu_scu@163.com,"Liu, Weidi/W-7502-2018; Chen, Zhi-Gang/ABE-9035-2020; Chen, Zhi-Gang/D-1558-2010; Shi, Xiao-Lei/AAE-7992-2020; 邓, 丁山/ABF-7645-2020; Zou, Jin/B-3183-2009; Chen, Zhi-Gang/D-1559-2010","Liu, Weidi/0000-0002-8271-639X; Chen, Zhi-Gang/0000-0001-9038-8974; Shi, Xiao-Lei/0000-0003-0905-2547; 邓, 丁山/0000-0001-7553-8655; Zou, Jin/0000-0001-9435-8043; Chen, Zhi-Gang/0000-0002-9309-7993",National Green Remanufacturing System Plan [[2017]327],This research is partially supported by the National Green Remanufacturing System Plan ([2017]327).,,76,20,21,25,32,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

Government is considered as the leader at the first level and tends to set a collection rate policy, which leads to collecting more used products in order to ensure a minimum distribution ratio to satisfy minimum demands. At the second level, the private sector is considered as a follower and tries to maximize its profit by designing its own closed-loop supply chain network according to the government's used products collection policy. A heuristic algorithm and an adaptive genetic algorithm based on the enumeration method are proposed, and their performances are evaluated through computational experiences. The comparison among numerical examples reveals that there is an obvious conflict between the government. and CLSC goals. Moreover, it shows that this conflict should be considered and elaborated in uncertain environment by applying the min-max regret scenario based robust optimization approach. The results show the necessity of applying robust bi-level programming to the closed-loop supply chain network design under the governmental legislative decisions as a leader-follower configuration.

The design of the promising biorefinery configurations considering preliminary and uncertain nature of technologies is one of the major biorefinery challenges, and it must be addressed systematically. This article presents key issues, challenges and opportunities for the modeling and optimization of microalgae-based biorefinery configurations. It reviews the processing pathways/networks for producing biofuels and various platform chemicals from microalgae with an emphasis on the development of the systematic modeling framework. Superstructure-based modeling and optimization can be a useful tool to identify the optimal/promising biorefinery configurations. Key components of the superstructure-based modeling framework are described, along with a comprehensive review of the existing studies on the superstructure-based optimization of biofuels/bioenergy production from microalgae. This paper also identifies potential perspectives for future research focusing on the application of the superstructure-based approach for the systematic design of sustainable microalgal biorefineries. Perspectives on the future integrated biorefineries considering carbon mitigation as well as heat and power integration are presented. Issues on sustainability and uncertainties modeling in the biorefinery design phase are also discussed.","[Rizwan, Muhammad; Almansoori, Ali; Elkamel, Ali] Khalifa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Petr Inst, POB 2533, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Elkamel, Ali] Univ Waterloo, Dept Chem Engn, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada","Almansoori, A (corresponding author), Khalifa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Petr Inst, POB 2533, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",ali.almansoori@ku.ac.ae,"elkamel, ali/ABC-2963-2020","Rizwan, Muhammad/0000-0002-2590-7675","research office of the Petroleum Institute, Abu Dhabi","The authors are thankful to the research office of the Petroleum Institute, Abu Dhabi for providing the financial support for this work.",,128,1,1,1,2,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1868-3967,1868-3975,,ENERGY SYST,Energy Syst.,NOV,2019,10,4,,,,,941,966,,10.1007/s12667-018-0296-6,,,26,Energy & Fuels,Energy & Fuels,JY0GP,WOS:000504103600005,,,,,2021-03-04

In the actual evaluation process, the decision makers may hesitate in a few linguistic terms and have different partiality towards each term, hence the possibility distribution based hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (PDHFLTSs), as expressed by a consecutive or non-consecutive linguistic term set, is suitable for such an evaluation. The purpose of this paper is to solve sustainable 3PRLP selection problems with linguistic information by developing an effective and robust method. We firstly redefine the covariance-based correlation coefficient that can simplify the computation to calculate the consensus degree, and then introduce the hesitant degree in context of possibility distribution information, in order to enrich measures of PDHFLTSs. On this basis, the weights of experts are computed for expression aggregation. Secondly, to overcome attributes' weights staying constant, the combination of group utility function and variable weight approach is introduced to give the weights of attributes. Most importantly, a decision method, called MULTIMOORA, is optimized by improving the ranking position method, and then, through the combination with PDHFLTS, we proposed a possibility distribution based hesitant fuzzy linguistic MULTIMOORA method with great robustness. At last, the presented method is applied to the field of sustainable third-party reverse logistics provider selection in the e-commerce express industry and the effectiveness is verified by several comparative analyses.","[Luo, Zunhao; Li, Zexin] Chongqing Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China; [Li, Zexin] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Dept Transportat, Hope Coll, Chengdu 610400, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Luo, ZH (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China.",zunhaoluo@cqu.edu.cn; lizexin@cqu.edu.cn,,,,,,89,4,4,3,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7390,,MATHEMATICS-BASEL,Mathematics,NOV,2019,7,11,,,,,,,1063,10.3390/math7111063,,,32,Mathematics,Mathematics,JV3TN,WOS:000502288700060,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

This paper builds a sustainable food grain transportation model for intermodal transportation operations between two Indian states, in the presence of hub disruption. A hub and spoke system is used to connect origin and destination warehouses through intermodal hubs in a multi-layered network. The problem is formulated as a multi-period mixed integer nonlinear single objective optimization problem considering minimization of transportation, hub location, rerouting, environmental and social costs with near optimal shipment quantities and hub allocations as the prime decisions. The proposed MINLP is solved using Particle Swarm Optimization with Differential Evolution (PSODE), a superior metaheuristic to deal with NP-hard problems. Convergence graphs and global optimal costs are reported for small, medium and large size instances consisting of 1824, 9768 and 28848 variables respectively, inspired from food grain industry in the southern part of India. Pareto plots are generated to capture the complementarity between economical and socio-environmental cost categories for all instances. The effect of hub location, hub disruption, cost consolidation and vehicle resource availability factors on individual and total costs is studied through sensitivity analysis. Results indicate that food grain demand is fulfilled with 14% increase in the mean total cost for single hub disruption case and with 40% increase for multiple hub disruption. Finally, managerial implications provide specific factor level recommendations for different strategic objectives.","[Maiyar, Lohithaksha M.; Thakkar, Jitesh J.] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India","Maiyar, LM (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",lohit10.maiyar@gmail.com; jtiitkgp@gmail.com,,,"Ministry of Human Resource and Development (MHRD), Department of Higher Education, Government of India [4-25/2013-TS-I]","This research is conducted in the context of project titled, 'Transportation management to implement NFSA (TMI)' sponsored by Ministry of Human Resource and Development (MHRD), Department of Higher Education, Government of India [sanction letter No. F.

In this article, two mathematical models considering competition and integrity in a three-echelon supply chain under uncertainty are proposed. The competition is formulated as a Stackelberg game such that the distribution centers have more power than the retailers. In the first model, decisions are made about the location and number of distribution centers (DCs), allocation of retailers, and the selling price of products. In the second model, based on the real world, the probability of risk and failure for the distribution centers are considered. Backup facilities should be established for unreliable facilities to meet the demands of retailers during disruption. To capture uncertainty, a two-stage stochastic approach is applied to model the problems. The first stage of the model belongs to the strategic planning and is not affected by randomness, while the second stage deals with tactical decisions depending on the realization of the first stage's random vector. In order to solve the problem, a hybrid genetic algorithm has been applied to large-scale problems. Numerical experiments have been conducted to assess the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Next, a sensitivity analysis is performed to recognize the most important parameters and evaluate the accuracy of our approach. Finally, to demonstrate the applicability of the model, the proposed model was implemented on the data of Alborz Pharmaceutical Company. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Disasters, especially earthquakes, have adverse consequences such as destruction, loss of human lives, and undermining the effectiveness of health services. This research considers a six-echelon blood supply chain which consists of donors, blood collection centers (permanent and temporary), regional blood centers, local blood centers, regional hospitals, and local hospitals. For the first time, we considered that helicopters could carry blood from regional hospitals to local hospitals and return injured people that cannot be treated in local hospitals to regional hospitals due to the limited capacity. In addition to the above, different transportations with limited capacities regarded, where the optimal number of required transportations equipment determined after the solution process. This research aims to avoid the worst consequences of a disaster using a neural-learning process to gain from past experiences to meet new challenges. For this aim, this article considers three objective functions that are minimizing total transportation time and cost while minimizing unfulfilled demand. The model implemented based on a real-world case study from the most recent earthquake in the Iran-Iraq border which named the deadliest earthquake of 2017.

The NK Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (NKHGA) is employed to cluster the villages, along with a novel density-based approach to optimise the supply chain network.

Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review was conducted focussing on the benefits of non-linear modes adoption. Findings The results show a high degree of convergence in findings, gaps and weaknesses of these literatures. Negative environmental, economic and operational impacts are understudied. There is a scarcity of studies identifying practices resulting in empirically tested benefits. The business and society case for non-linear production is still largely built upon conceptual studies, modelling and a few case studies. Despite a normative focus, there is very little use of theory, in particular, management theories. Research limitations/implications - First, the authors use only one, albeit highly recognized database, Scopus. This database may have omitted some relevant research, journals such as the Journal of Cleaner Production and Resources Conservation & Recycling that are more likely to publish such research and also have a more interdisciplinary approach. This is an important gap and interesting result to claim for more interdisciplinary research. Second, the filtering process used and the focus on Association of Business Schools top journals may have also omitted some relevant research, such as a large stream of literature in specialist journals such as Resources Conservation and Recycling and the Journal of Cleaner Production. Practical implications - There are contradictions, tensions and epistemological ambiguity that needs to be critically addressed. Such tensions may be associated with the knowledge field that gave rise to these different non-linear production approaches. Many of them appeared at the same time, but from different sciences and disciplines with their own perspectives. Then in doing so, they create confusion in the definitions of CE, assumptions underlying modelling and business choices arising from this complexity. This can be minimized through the critical interpretation of knowledge to elucidate epistemological quandaries to improve the understanding of the economic, social and environmental impacts of practices. Social implications In some way, this result makes sense, as the authors have limited the search to management, business and accounts journals, especially talking about Operations Management journals. This is an important gap and interesting result to claim for more interdisciplinary research. Originality/value In addition to gaps previously described, the authors identified areas of tensions where the literature offers inconclusive - often contradictory - findings requiring further exploration. A better understanding of these tensions is required to understand the impacts of non-linear production and develop policy guidelines for industry and policymakers to scale-up CE.","[Sehnem, Simone] Univ Oeste Santa Catarina, Dept Management, Chapeco, Brazil; [Sehnem, Simone] Univ Sul Santa Catarina, Dept Management, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Vazquez-Brust, Diego] Univ Portsmouth, Fac Business & Law, Portsmouth, Hants, England; [Vazquez-Brust, Diego] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Prod Engn, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Pereira, Susana Carla Farias] Fundacao Getulio Vargas, Dept Operat Management, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Campos, Lucila M.

Earlier studies and reports say that many organizations go out of businesses within two or three years after they experience a major disruption. Therefore, companies in today's volatile business arena need to possess the necessary resilience level to combat supply china disruptions. This is even more important for organizations of developing nations, which are constantly struggling to gain the advantages of globalization and to grab the new opportunities. Thus, this paper aims to help organizations understand their SC resilience level through a framework. Design/methodology/approach The methodology comprises integrated Delphi - fuzzy logic approach in identifying formative elements of SC resilience from a diverse resilience related body of knowledge and distinguish key obstacles of SC resilience based on their performance level. Findings Findings reveal that SC flexibility components such as sourcing, manufacturing and logistic flexibility are the major contributors of SC resilience index of case organization. Similarly, lack of risk management culture, inter-organizational relationships, information sharing and integration of SC stakeholders are the major inhibitors of resilience. Thus, the organization needs to overcome these identified obstacles to enhance their SC resilience level. Practical implications - Present study offers a novel focus of research on SC resilience measurement that is significant for understanding the level of immunity enterprises possess to unanticipated SC interruptions, and the ability to bounce back after an unforeseen event. Originality/value This paper proposes an integrated Delphi - fuzzy logic framework for measuring SC resilience. In doing so, the study identifies key potential inhibitors of SC resilience of the case company under study.","[Kumar, Siva] Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Roorkee, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Anbanandam, Ramesh] Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Management Studies, Roorkee, Uttar Pradesh, India","Kumar, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Roorkee, Uttar Pradesh, India.",pujarisivakumar@gmail.com,"Anbanandam, Ramesh/O-8736-2019","Anbanandam, Ramesh/0000-0002-2040-3064; , Siva Kumar/0000-0002-9178-4220",,,,99,3,3,1,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1368-3047,1758-8057,,MEAS BUS EXCELL,Meas.

Since global warming has become critical, researchers and managers of the supply chain have paid more attention to environmental issues. With the environmental factor, the complexity in designing an optimal supply chain network essentially increases. This research considers a multi-objective (minimal total cost and CO2 emissions) supply chain network design with environmental factor (SCNDEF), which includes the features of multiple echelons, stochastic demands, production/storage capacity, environmental investment, and multiple time periods. In order to help managers make decisions about the SCNDEF, this research performs sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of key parameters, such as customers? satisfaction level and limits on CO2 emissions, on the performance of the supply chain network. Numerical examples are given to verify the proposed methodology. The results show that a good SCNDEF can not only improve the performance of the entire supply chain but also achieve sustainable environmental protection. These research findings are intended to serve as practical reference for industry.","[Gong, Dah-Chuan] Chang Gung Univ, Dept Ind & Business Management, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Gong, Dah-Chuan] Chang Gung Mem Hosp Linkou, Div Supply Chain, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Li, Pei-Han; Chen, Ping-Shun] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Taoyuan 32023, Taiwan; [Wang, Fan] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sun Yat Sen Business Sch, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Chen, PS (corresponding author), Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Taoyuan 32023, Taiwan.",pingshun@cycu.edu.tw,,,Chang Gung Memorial HospitalChang Gung Memorial Hospital [BMRPE93],This work was partially supported by Chang Gung Memorial Hospital under Grant BMRPE93.,,22,0,0,1,2,CHINESE INST ENGINEERS,TAIPEI,"#1, 4TH FL, SEC 2, JEN-AI RD, TAIPEI 10019, TAIWAN",0253-3839,2158-7299,,J CHIN INST ENG,J.

In order to support the arising trend, this paper presents a comprehensive mathematical model for a multi-period, multi-product, multi-modal and bi-objective green closed-loop supply chain. The objective of the model is to minimize the total cost and environmental emissions through making the best decisions on facility location, transportation amounts and inventory balances. According to the inherent complexity of the problem and considering multi-product, multi-period and multi-modality assumptions makes it hard to handle, and as for the solution approach, an effective accelerated benders decomposition algorithm is implemented. Then, computational results for a set of numerical example are discussed. Besides, the model and solution approach are applied on a wire-and-cable industry. Then, a sensitivity analysis is implemented in an effort to validate the model. Results reveal applicability of the proposed mathematical model and presented solution approach. Following the obtained results, it can be validly concluded that the suggested solution approach leads to more than 13 percent reduction in total cost for the studied case, and can be even employed for larger and more complex real-world industrial applications.

A simultaneous design of forward and reverse logistics can keep us away from sub-optimality caused by tackling these two phases (forward and reverse logistics) separately. Design/methodology/approach Hence, this paper presents a new multi-objective mathematical model for integrated forward and reverse logistics regarding economic, environmental and social issues. A new hybrid multi-objective metaheuristic algorithm is developed to obtain a set of efficient solutions (Pareto solutions). The proposed algorithm hybridizes a well-known, non-dominated genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) with a simulated annealing algorithm. Findings To validate the algorithm, its results are compared to the obtained solutions from simple NSGA-II with respect to some comparison metrics. The numerical results show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Finally, concluding remarks and future research directions are provided.

An optimized supply chain network (SCN) has been designed with four layers of structure starting from raw material suppliers to the retailers through the layers of the manufacturers and the distributors aiming at the net present value (NPV) maximization. The cost calculation includes operating expenditure (OPEX) and capital expenditure (CAPEX) components involving transport, storage, production and import decisions as linear variables and decisions on connections between two nodes between two consecutive layers as binary variables. The distribution layer of the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model has been uniquely designed for the imported ethanol to serve the twin purposes of meeting the unmet demand as well as enhancing the bio-ethanol product quality in terms of research octane number. The revenue generation is calculated not only from selling the final product but also from the carbon credits calculated using greenhouse gas emission (GHGe) during project life cycle assessment. Further, sensitivity analysis has been performed to show the effect of various parameters such as modes of transport, transport distance limitation on feedstock and product, number of zones, international fuel price fluctuations, feedstock availability on NPV. With similar to 80% increase in demand over the 9-year planning horizon, a dynamically changing supply chain (SC) structure shows a similar to 36% increase in the newly added locations. Feed availability, critical for Indian scenario, to the tune of at least 40% of the capacity is needed to meet the projected demands. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It can help to build a low-carbon high-growth global economy and guarantee the global well-being of people. In this paper, three pillars of sustainable development, i.e., economic, environmental, and social, are considered and discussed to design a supply chain network. The proposed model tries to maximize profit primarily while capturing societal community development by prioritizing the less developed regions. Moreover, the model ensures that the environmentally friendly facilities can operate in the supply chain network while others have to be repaired. Furthermore, quantifying the benefits of transportation decisions in terms of both cost and environmental impact savings to improve the sustainability of logistics systems is considered. In addition, the model is regarded as robust programming for the problem to approximate real situations. The proposed model is implemented in some numerical examples and in a real case study. Numerical results and computational analysis are indicative of the significance of the model and through conducting the case study, it is demonstrated that the proposed model can be implemented successfully in practice and it would be beneficial to all the three pillars of sustainable development. Moreover, the managerial insights for the managers of the supply chain networks are provided to make the most appropriate decisions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

An efficient and effective supply chain network is of vital importance for improving customer satisfaction, optimizing the allocation of resources, and increasing profitability. The environmental concerns and social responsibility awareness of the whole society have spurred researchers and managers to design sustainable supply chains (SSCs) integrating the economic, environmental, and social factors. In addition, the innate uncertainty of the SCND problem requires an integrated method to cope. In this regard, this study develops a multi-echelon multi-objective robust fuzzy closed-loop supply chain network (CLSCN) design model under uncertainty including all three dimensions of sustainability. This model considers the total cost minimization, carbon caps, and social impact maximization concurrently to realize supply chain sustainability, and is able to make a balance between the conflicting multiple objectives. Meanwhile, the uncertainty of the parameters is divided into two categories and addressed with two approaches: the first category is missed working days related to social impact, which is solved by the fuzzy membership theory; the second category is the demand and remanufacturing rate, which is settled by a robust optimization method. To validate the ability and applicability of the model and solution approach, a numerical example is conducted and solved using ILOG CPLEX. The result shows that the supply chain network structure and the value of the optimization objectives will change when considering sustainability and different degrees of uncertainty. This will enable supply chain managers to reduce the environmental impact and enhance the social benefits of their supply chain activities, and design a more stable supply chain to better cope with the influence of uncertainty.","[Zhang, Xin; Zhao, Gang] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Transport & Commun, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Qi, Yingxiu] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Traff & Transportat, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Li, Botang] Guangzhou Maritime Univ, Sch Port & Shipping Management, Guangzhou 510725, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Zhang, X (corresponding author), Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Transport & Commun, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.",xinzhangandy@163.com; gangzhao@shmtu.edu.cn; 17114221@bjtu.edu.cn; botangli1991@163.com,,"Zhang, Xin/0000-0001-5830-4363",Postgraduate Innovation Fund Project of Shanghai Maritime University [2016ycx066],This research was supported by the Postgraduate Innovation Fund Project of Shanghai Maritime University (2016ycx066).,,73,1,1,4,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT 2,2019,11,20,,,,,,,5726,10.3390/su11205726,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JP6US,WOS:000498398900183,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

However, planning and implementing an appropriate RL network within existing supply chains for product recovery that increases customer satisfaction, decreases overall costs, and provides a competitive advantage over other companies is complex. In the current study, we developed a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for a reverse logistics network design (RLND) in a multi-period setting. The RL network consists of collection centres, capacitated inspection and remanufacturing centres and customer zones to serve. Moreover, the model incorporates significant characteristics such as vehicle type selection and carbon emissions (through transportation and operations). Since the network design problems are NP-hard, we first propose a solution approach based on Benders decomposition (BD). Then, based on the structure of the problem we propose a three-phase heuristic approach. Finally, to establish the performance and robustness of the proposed solution approach, the results are compared with benchmark results obtained using CPLEX in terms of both solution quality and computational time. From the computational results, we validated that the three-phase heuristic approach performs superior to the BD and Branch &Cut approach.","[Reddy, K.

Nonetheless, this intensive model and the related globalized processing and marketing system poses a challenge to the conservation of biodiversity and to environmental sustainability. In addition, volatility on world cereal markets is threatening farmers' income, triggering diversification patterns. One of this pattern is the creation of alternative food chains intended as supply chains that are territorially embedded and able to reconnect producers with consumers. In this context, this paper aims to explore the diversity of alternative bread chains and valorisation practices, in order to identify organizational models, assess their economic performance in terms of creating added value distributing it along the stages of the chain and to understand the role played by ancient wheat varieties in differentiating the product. In order to do this, the paper develops a comparative case study analysis of several locally-based alternative bread supply chains in Tuscany (Italy). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key actors, selected considering all the steps in the supply chain: from growing the wheat and milling the grain through to the end product. From these interviews differences emerged between locally-based bread supply chains in terms of the valorisation system followed and the institutional arrangements. While the locally-based chains featuring modern wheat varieties have more conventional characteristics and pursue differentiation strategies based on certification, chains based on ancient wheat follow a more informal route, and product quality is mainly guaranteed by the reputation of the network. Furthermore, in the bread supply chains featuring ancient varieties, the methods for reducing transaction costs are linked to a bottom-up collective action, embeddedness strategies among stakeholders (that include also consumers), and are built on a relational approach based on trust, knowledge exchange and social networks. Results provide an assessment of the performances of different locally-based bread supply chains, identify critical aspects and suggest some policy implications for all types of chains.","[Sacchi, Giovanna; Belletti, Giovanni; Biancalani, Martina; Lombardi, GinevraVirginia; Stefani, Gianluca] Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Management, Via Pandette 32, I-50127 Florence, Italy","Sacchi, G (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Management, Via Pandette 32, I-50127 Florence, Italy.",giovanna.sacchi@unifi.it; giovanni.belletti@unifi.it; martina.biancalani@gmail.com; ginevravirginia.lombardi@unifi.it; gianluca.stefani@unifi.it,"sacchi, giovanna/I-2242-2019; Stefani, Gianluca/Q-9446-2019","Stefani, Gianluca/0000-0002-0687-9955; sacchi, giovanna/0000-0002-9286-7810","REGIONE TOSCANA, Tuscan Rural Development Plan (PSR) 2014-20 Integrated food chain project; LIFE project Semente partecipata [LIFE13 ENV/IT/001258]","The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from:; - REGIONE TOSCANA, Tuscan Rural Development Plan (PSR) 2014-20 Integrated food chain project, Grant 2015; - LIFE project Semente partecipata (Project LIFE13 ENV/IT/001258).",,50,1,1,0,8,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0743-0167,,,J RURAL STUD,J.

The volume of global container movement combined with information opaqueness and process complexity necessitates implementing a robust technology solution with real time tracking capabilities. Blockchain is an emerging technology that offers the necessary platform to track and manage shipment movements in the supply chain using a peer-to-peer, secured, distributed ledger, and without intermediaries or trusted third parties. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution for efficient supply chain management involving items shipped via smart containers. Our proposed solution utilizes the features of smart contracts in Ethereum blockchain to govern and manage interactions between the sender and receiver. Shipped items are included in smart containers equipped with Internet of Things (IoT) sensors that can be used to track and monitor predefined shipping conditions related to temperature, geographical location, humidity, pressure, light exposure, sudden fall, broken seal, etc. Ethereum smart contracts are used to manage shipment conditions, automate payments, legitimize receiver and also issue a refund in case of violations to predefined conditions. In the paper, we present and discuss key aspects related to architectural design, entity relations, interactions among participants, information flow, implementation and testing of the overall system functionality with a potential business case applied to vaccine supply chain. The Smart contracts were implemented in Solidity language and tested using Remix IDE environment, the code has been made publicly available for academic, research and practice community.","[Hasan, Haya; AlHadhrami, Esra; AlDhaheri, Alia; Salah, Khaled] Khalifa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Jayaraman, Raja] Khalifa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates","Jayaraman, R (corresponding author), Khalifa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",haya.hasan@ku.ac.ae; esra.alhadhrami@etic.ac.ae; alia.dhaheri@ku.ac.ae; khaled.salah@ku.ac.ae; raja.jayaraman@ku.ac.ae,"Jayaraman, Raja/D-5869-2013","Jayaraman, Raja/0000-0002-2749-2688",Khalifa University of Science and Technology [LIRA-2019001],This publication is based upon work supported by the Khalifa University of Science and Technology under Award No. LIRA-2019001.,,26,15,15,13,61,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-8352,1879-0550,,COMPUT IND ENG,Comput.

However, rigorous environmental rules and policies pushed organizations to accept affirmative changes like green supply chain management practices in their processes of the supply chain. Selection of green supplier is a tedious task and comprises a lot of challenges starting from evaluation to their final selection, which is experienced by supplier management professionals. The development and implementation of practical decision-making tools that seek to address these challenges are rapidly evolving. In the present work, the evaluation of a set of suppliers is primarily based on both conventional and environmental criteria. This work proposes a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) based framework that is used to evaluate green supplier selection by using an integrated fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) with the other three techniques namely MABAC (Multi-Attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison), WASPAS (Weighted Aggregated Sum-Product Assessment) and TOPSIS (Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal Solution). Initially, six green supplier selection environmental criteria (Environmental management system, green image, staff environment training, eco-design, pollution control, and resource consumption) and three conventional criteria (price, quality and service level) have been identified through literature review and expert's opinions to employ MCDM approach. A real-world case study of the automotive industry in India is deliberated to exhibit the proposed framework applicability. From AHP findings, 'Environment management system', 'Pollution control', 'Quality', and 'Green image' have been ranked as the topmost four green supplier selection criteria. Besides, the consistency test was performed to check the uniformity of the expert's input whereas the 'robustness' of the approach was tested by performing sensitivity analysis. The results illustrate that the applied fuzzy hybrid methods reach common green supplier rankings. Moreover, out of the four green supplier's alternatives, supplier number 'one' got the highest rank. This shows that the applied models are robust in nature. Further, this study relinquishes a single platform for the selection of green supplier under fuzzy environment. The applied methodology and its analysis will provide insight to decision-makers of supplier selection. It may aid decision-makers and the procurement department not only to differentiate the significant green supplier selection criteria but also to assess the most efficient green supplier in the supply chain in the global market.","[Gupta, Shubham; Soni, Umang] Univ Delhi, Netaji Subhas Inst Technol, Delhi, India; [Kumar, Girish] Delhi Technol Univ, New Delhi, India","Soni, U (corresponding author), Netaji Subhas Inst Technol, MPAE Div, Room 140,Block 6, New Delhi, India.",umangsoni.1@gmail.com,"Kumar, Girish/AAN-8929-2020","Kumar, Girish/0000-0002-0448-8918; Soni, Umang/0000-0003-3583-311X",,,,106,18,18,11,40,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-8352,1879-0550,,COMPUT IND ENG,Comput.

Therefore, the perturbations of timing are presented until the possible obsolescence, with parallel execution of the network simulation model (NSM) to evaluate the impact of the finite lifespan on the value of the chain. The EMRP, as well as the NSM, are based on the skeleton of the material requirements planning model, where delays and their perturbations are presented transparently. Contrary to the previous studies of the net present value (NPV) in the EMRP skeleton, where the infinite horizon is assumed, the impact of shortening the horizon of activities is shown here, in order to also evaluate the risk of financing investments in the SC with a shorter lifespan of products or technology.

Establishing efficient and cost-effective transportation is a key element of establishing sustainable linkages along food supply chains between farmers, storage and transport companies, and consumers. In this regard, infrastructural constraints to sustainability in agricultural production exacerbate transportation costs and risks, and thus result in lower performance of agricultural producers. As fuel consumption is, first, the most significant cost in agricultural logistics and, second, particularly sensitive to disruptions of transport, loading, and storage infrastructure, management of fuel costs is crucial to assure profit margin of an agricultural enterprise. By transforming the standard economic order quantity (EOQ) model, the authors attempt to build an approach to the optimization of fuel costs. The analysis made in the cases of twelve large crop farms in three territories of Southern Russia allowed the consideration of: (1) fragmentation in storage infrastructure; (2) variations in fuel consumption depending on the vehicle load ratio; (3) the use of their own fleet of vehicles against the outsourcing of transport operations. The authors find that the tactics of optimization of fuel costs vary depending on the location of a farm in relation to grain storage facilities. Particularly, the farms located in areas of high concentration of storage facilities benefit from using their own fleet of vehicles, while those experiencing longer distances of transportation should outsource the performance of logistics operations to third parties. To overcome a site-specific nature, the transformed EOQ model should accommodate country-specific requirements, specifically, the level of fragmentation of transport and storage infrastructure, average distance of transportation from a farm to receival site, and average fuel consumption rates depending on the types of trucks commonly used by farmers. The key recommendation is that sustainability-aimed management of logistics costs should consider combining the operation of trucks by a farm with the outsourcing of transportation operations to address the fragmentation of transport and storage infrastructure.","[Gao, Tianming; Erokhin, Vasilii] Harbin Engn Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Arskiy, Aleksandr] RUDN Univ, Fac Econ, Moscow 117198, Russia","Erokhin, V (corresponding author), Harbin Engn Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",gtmmail@163.com; basilic@list.ru; arskiy@list.ru,"Erokhin, Vasilii/K-1608-2013","Erokhin, Vasilii/0000-0002-3745-5469","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, ChinaFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [HEUCFJ170901, HEUCFP201829, HEUCFW170905, 3072019CFG0901, 3072019CFP0902]","This research and the APC were funded by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China, grant numbers HEUCFJ170901, HEUCFP201829, HEUCFW170905, 3072019CFG0901, 3072019CFP0902.",,87,0,0,1,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT 1,2019,11,19,,,,,,,5463,10.3390/su11195463,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JI5RS,WOS:000493525500322,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

These policies are data-driven and model many features of the demand such as correlation and remain robust to parameter misspecification. We present a model that can be generalized to multiproduct settings and extended to multiperiod problems. This is accomplished by modeling the uncertain demand via sets. In this way, it offers a natural framework to study competing policies such as base-stock, affine, and approximative approaches with respect to their profit, sensitivity to parameters and assumptions, and computational scalability. We show that the periodic-affine policies are sustainable-that is, time consistent-because they warrant optimality both within subperiods and over the entire planning horizon. This approach is tractable and free of distributional assumptions, and, hence, suited for real-world applications. We provide efficient algorithms to obtain the optimal periodic-affine policies and demonstrate their advantages on the sales data from one of India's largest pharmacy retailers.","[Bandi, Chaithanya] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Han, Eojin; Nohadani, Omid] Northwestern Univ, Ind Engn & Management Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Bandi, C (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",c-bandi@kellogg.northwestern.edu; eojinhan2020@u.northwestern.edu; nohadani@northwestern.edu,"Bandi, Chaithanya/ABB-5614-2020; LI, DONGLIN/AAS-1210-2020","Bandi, Chaithanya/0000-0002-7990-6512; ",,,,48,1,1,14,54,INFORMS,CATONSVILLE,"5521 RESEARCH PARK DR, SUITE 200, CATONSVILLE, MD 21228 USA",0025-1909,1526-5501,,MANAGE SCI,Manage.

Adoption and sustained use of solar PV merit participation of local communities in planning and implementation. The literature on off-grid solar PV interventions that do not take the approach of involving communities point towards the difficulties experienced in reaching the bottom of the pyramid (BoP) communities as wells as in supply chain and after-sales service. Similarly, there is a gap in scientific literature that explores community inclusive initiatives to foster sustained uptake of solar PV technologies. Our study fills this gap, and discusses: 1) pathways to engage with rural poor communities to promote solar off-grid access, and 2) the impact of engaging with these communities particularly women, on their energy security and livelihood opportunities. We study a two-phased intervention in rural poor setting in Dungarpur district of Rajasthan state in India. The intervention can be broadly classified into two phases: (i) the distribution of solar study lamps to rural school students and mothers, wherein the lamps were assembled and maintained by the local community (self-help group networks), (ii) the entrepreneurship development of local community members towards continued livelihood through solar. We adopted mixed methods approach to collect and analyze the quantitative data from beneficiary households, while qualitative data were collected from SHG members. Our findings demonstrate the utility of localized intervention and the significance and challenges of engaging local communities. The consumers used these solar lamps for multiple activities and prefer solar over grid electricity for basic lighting. The voltage fluctuations or poor quality of electricity supply influences the preference to solar over the conventional grid. Local services enabled continued functioning of lamps, thereby increasing consumer confidence. The intervention built capacity of and created continued livelihood opportunities for local women in these communities, resulting in their economic and social growth. Appropriate capacity building and support to the SHG federations can channelize clean energy interventions at required speed, quality, and coverage.

In addition, in production and logistics, designers of scheduling systems must consider sustainability-related expectations. This paper presents an energy-efficient scheduling and rescheduling method (named Green Rescheduling Method, GRM). GRM aims at the solving of the dynamic scheduling problem under the condition of a certain level of routing flexibility enabling the reassignment of tasks to new resources. The key performance indicators integrated into the proposed GRM are effectiveness and efficiency-oriented. Applications concern the domains of production and logistics. In order to assess the proposed approach, experimentations have been made and results illustrate the applicability of GRM to build efficient and effective scheduling and rescheduling both for flexible manufacturing systems and inventory distribution systems in a physical internet network. A mathematical formulation for flexible job shop problem with energy consumption is also proposed using mixed Integer programming to evaluate the performance of the predictive part of GRM.","[Nouiri, Maroua; Bekrar, Abdelghani; Trentesaux, Damien] Univ Polytech Hauts France, UMR CNRS 8201, LAMIH, F-59313 Le Mont Houy, Valenciennes, France","Nouiri, M (corresponding author), Univ Polytech Hauts France, UMR CNRS 8201, LAMIH, F-59313 Le Mont Houy, Valenciennes, France.",maroua.nouiri@gmail.com,"trentesaux, damien/D-2791-2009","trentesaux, damien/0000-0003-2489-6203",French Ministry of Sciences; Haut de France region; FEDEREuropean Commission; national ANR project Pi-NutsFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-14-CE27-0015],"The research work presented in this paper comes from the ELSAT2020 project of CPER sponsored by the French Ministry of Sciences, the Haut de France region and the FEDER and the national ANR project Pi-Nuts [Grant number ANR-14-CE27-0015].",,55,6,6,15,52,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

The aim of this study is to identify critical betweenness sectors and transactions that play an important intermediate role in the supply chain, which can provide additional insights for CO2 emissions. Based on the input-output and energy consumption data in China, the notion of network centrality and structural path analysis method are employed in this paper to identify critical betweenness sectors and transactions, and then the evolutionary trends of betweenness sectors and transactions are analyzed from 2005 to 2015. The results show that some critical betweenness sectors, such as Metal products sector and Electrical equipment sector, have huge potential for carbon emission reduction, which fail to receive sufficient attention from the perspective of production or consumption. Some critical transactions, such as the transaction from Nonmetal products sector to Construction sector, have a large amount of CO2 emissions. The transaction from Metallurgy sector to Electrical equipment sector became increasingly important in China from 2005 to 2015. Additionally, the evolutionary trends of different transactions are significantly different. The findings reveal that special attention should be paid to these critical betweenness sectors and transactions and policy development should be dynamic to respond to changes in CO2 emissions that are generated by different betweenness sectors and transactions.

Uncertainty associated with food grain supply further intensifies the problem steering the need for designing robust, cost-efficient and sustainable models. In line with this, this paper aims to develop a robust and sustainable intermodal transportation model to facilitate single type of food grain commodity shipments while considering procurement uncertainty, greenhouse gas emissions, and intentional hub disruption. The problem is designed as a mixed integer non-linear robust optimisation model on a hub and spoke network for evaluating near optimal shipment quantity, route selection and hub location decisions. The robust optimisation approach considers minimisation of total relative regret associated with total cost subject to several real-time constraints. A version of Particle Swarm Optimisation with Differential Evolution is proposed to tackle the resulting NP-hard problem. The model is tested with two other state-of the art meta-heuristics for small, medium, and large datasets subject to different procurement scenarios inspired from real time food grain operations in Indian context.

In the present research, regarding the current intense competition among large manufacturing companies for achieving a greater market share, a bi-level robust optimization model is developed as a leader-follower problem using Stackelberg game in the field of Aggregate Production Planning (APP). The leader company with higher influence intended to produce new products, which could replace the existing products. The follower companies, as rivals, were also seeking more sales, but they did not have the intention and ability to produce such new products. The price of the new products was determined by the presented elasticity relations between uncertain demand and price. After linearization, using the KKT conditions, the bi-level robust model was transformed into an ordinary uni-level model. Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, Benders Decomposition Algorithm (BDA) was proposed for overcoming the computational complexities in large scale. Finally, using the real data of Sarvestan Sepahan Co as a leader company, the validity of the developed model as well as efficiency and convergence of the BDA was investigated. The computational results clearly showed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed BDA. (C) 2019 Sharif University of Technology. All rights reserved.","[Aazami, A.

This study focuses on supply chains, or supplier-customer networks of firms and examines how these supply chains enable production losses caused by natural disasters to propagate and persist in regions not directly affected by the disaster. We apply an agent-based model to the actual supply chains of nearly one million firms in Japan to estimate the direct and indirect effects of the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake. We then employ the same model to predict the effect of the Nankai Trough earthquake, a mega earthquake predicted to hit major industrial cities in Japan in the near future. We find that the indirect effects of the disasters on production due to propagation (10.6% of gross domestic product in the case of the Nankai earthquake) are substantially larger than their direct effects (0.5%). Our simulation analyses to compare the actual network with hypothetical networks suggest that these indirect effects are more prominent and persistent when supply chains are characterized by scale-free properties, difficulty in substitution among intermediate products, and complex cycles in networks.","[Inoue, Hiroyasu] Univ Hyogo, Grad Sch Simulat Studies, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Todo, Yasuyuki] Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Todo, Yasuyuki] Res Inst Econ Trade & Ind, Tokyo, Japan","Inoue, H (corresponding author), Univ Hyogo, Grad Sch Simulat Studies, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.",inoue@sim.u-hyogo.ac.jp,,"Inoue, Hiroyasu/0000-0003-1639-4801","MEXTMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); JSPS KakenhiMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [15K01217, 18K04615, 18H03642, 25101003]","This research was conducted as part of a project entitled 'Large-scale Simulation and Analysis of Economic Network for Macro Prudential Policy,' undertaken at the Research Institute of Economy, Trade, and Industry.

Firstly, a mathematical model is developed for generating an ideal plan under imperfect production for a finite planning horizon while maximizing total profit, and then we re-formulate the model to generate the recovery plan after happening of each sudden disturbance. Considering the high commercial cost and computational intensity and complexity of this problem, we propose an efficient heuristic, to obtain a recovery plan, for each disturbance type, for a finite future period, after the occurrence of a disturbance. The heuristic solutions are compared with a standard solution technique for a considerable number of random test instances, which demonstrates the trustworthy performance of the developed heuristics. We also develop another heuristic for managing the combined effects of multiple sudden disturbances in a period. Finally, a simulation approach is proposed to investigate the effects of different types of disturbance events generated randomly. We present several numerical examples and random experiments to explicate the benefits of our developed approaches. Results reveal that in the event of sudden disturbances, the proposed mathematical and heuristic approaches are capable of generating recovery plans accurately and consistently.","[Paul, Sanjoy Kumar] Univ Technol Sydney, UTS Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Sarker, Ruhul; Essam, Daryl] Univ New South Wales, Sch Engn & Informat Technol, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Lee, Paul Tae-Woo] Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Paul, SK (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, UTS Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",sanjoy.paul@uts.edu.au,"Paul, Sanjoy/K-2618-2019","Paul, Sanjoy/0000-0001-9523-179X; Sarker, Ruhul/0000-0002-1363-2774","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP170102416, 02.101080.130.2210197]; University of Technology Sydney",This research is partially funded by Australian Research Council DP170102416 awarded to Prof. Ruhul Sarker and Dr. Daryl Essam and Business Research Grant 02.101080.130.2210197 from the University of Technology Sydney awarded to Dr. Sanjoy Paul.,,74,9,9,2,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0254-5330,1572-9338,,ANN OPER RES,Ann.

The application of the advanced self-healing polymers in packaging material has enabled the packaging to withstand fatigue associated failures with the increased mechanical strength. In this perspective, this paper develops a multi-attribute closed-loop supply chain model for self-healing polymers based returnable transport packaging with single supplier, single manufacturer, and multi-retailers under budget and storage constraints. A single-setup-multi-delivery (SSMD) policy is recommended for the centralized decision making of the supplier and manufacturer in a proposed supply chain management to improve the economic sustainability. To depict the real world situations for environmental protection, the effect of the variable aspects of transportation and carbon emissions are minimized through the optimal production delivery strategies. Multi-objectives of the proposed supply chain model include profit maximization and carbon emissions minimization of the system. A weighted goal programming technique along with three distinct metaheuristic approaches are applied to obtain the efficient trade-off among model objectives. The experimental analysis is carried out to illustrate the practical implication of the proposed supply chain management model and numerical results are analyzed for their robustness. The experimental outcomes for the application of SSMD policy are compared with single-setup-singledelivery (SSSD) policy, which proves that the SSMD policy improves the total profit of the whole system by devising the optimal number of shipments. The sensitivity analysis is carried out to study the behavior of the key parameters involved in the proposed supply chain management for varying decision maker preferences and significant managerial insights are obtained.","[Sarkar, Biswajit] Yonsei Univ, Dept Ind Engn, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea; [Tayyab, Muhammad] Hanyang Univ, Dept Ind & Management Engn, Ansan 15588, South Korea; [Kim, Namhun] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Mech Aerosp & Nucl Engn, Ulsan 44919, South Korea; [Habib, Muhammad Salman] Univ Engn & Technol Lahore, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, Lahore, Pakistan","Kim, N (corresponding author), Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Mech Aerosp & Nucl Engn, Ulsan 44919, South Korea.",nhkim@unist.ac.kr,"Sarkar, Biswajit/AAJ-7089-2020","Habib, Muhammad Salman/0000-0003-3892-7234; Muhammad, Tayyab/0000-0001-7092-7440; Kim, Namhun/0000-0003-4429-2191; Sarkar, Dr. Biswajit/0000-0002-6583-8416",Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology through the Development of 3D Printing-based Smart Manufacturing core Technology research Fund [1.190032.01],This work was supported by the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology through the Development of 3D Printing-based Smart Manufacturing core Technology research Fund under Grant 1.190032.01.,,60,21,22,3,22,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-8352,1879-0550,,COMPUT IND ENG,Comput.

This paper addresses the design of a resilient green-closed loop supply chain network for perishable products under the risk of electric power network disruption. The research has presented an integrated model for the interdependent two-layer network structure as a strategy to mitigate the power disruption risk in order to minimize the expected total network cost and the expected total amount of carbon emissions. Integration of two networks on both objectives along with the effect of products' lifetime has been analyzed in a real case study of the dairy industry. The results designate that the integration of the two networks leads to improvements in both objective functions. The average total network cost and total carbon emissions have been reduced by 21% and 25% compared to the non-integrated layers, respectively. Furthermore, by increasing the products lifetime, the projected model enjoys higher performance being compared with the non-integrated layers model. This paper concludes that the integrated decision making about the infrastructure networks e.g. power network with the supply chain enjoys economic and environmental benefits for both networks layers under power network disruptions.

But what counts as sustainable and what does this mean on the ground in producing countries like Malaysia and Indonesia? This article argues that the form of sustainability offered by certification schemes such as the RSPO fetishes the commodity palm oil in order to assuage critical consumer initiatives in the North. This technical-managerial solution is part of a larger project: the post political climate politics regime (Swyngedouw) that attempts to green the status quo. But certification obscures the problem that it is not the commodity itself but the social relations of nature in the production of the commodity that need to become sustainable. It will be shown that despite certification, these social relations of nature are contested in Southeast Asia. Social and political struggles over land rights, workers' rights and environmental justice are repoliticising debates over palm oil, opening up trajectories of eco-social transformation that make alternative sustainability futures for palm oil possible.

Design/methodology/approach This paper starts with an in-depth review of existing frameworks or models for lean implementation in health care in general and in HSCM specifically. Based on the literature studies and taking experts' opinions into account, a new framework for lean implementation in the Saudi HSCM is presented. Findings A new lean implementation framework is offered to decision-makers in the health-care organization for implementing a lean approach in HSCM practices. Research limitations/implications This study focused on health-care organizations, which were selected from hospitals operated by the Ministry of Health and only those hospitals that are accredited by both the Saudi Central Board for Accreditation of Healthcare Institutions and the Joint Commission International. The framework is limited to Saudi health care. Practical implications The lean supply chain management (LSCM) framework is easy to understand and use without much complexity. This simplicity makes the LSCM applicable in health-care settings. Further, LSCM was validated in three different hospitals, and it helped them to identify and improve their non-added activities, thereby readying them for lean deployment in HSCM. Originality/value Little attention has been paid to implementing a lean approach by health-care providers in developing countries. This study presents a new framework that is considered the first of its kind for implementing lean in HSCM in Saudi. This framework could help HSCMs' decision-makers to implement lean successfully in HSCM practices.","[Almutairi, Abdulaziz Marzouq] King Saud Med City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Salonitis, Konstantinos; Al-Ashaab, Ahmed] Cranfield Univ, Mfg, Cent Bedfordshire, Cranfield, Beds, England","Almutairi, AM (corresponding author), King Saud Med City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",a.almutairi@cranfield.ac.uk; k.salonitis@cranfield.ac.uk; a.al-ashaab@cranfield.ac.uk,"Salonitis, Konstantinos/F-9873-2019; Salonitis, Konstantinos/D-2728-2009","Salonitis, Konstantinos/0000-0003-1059-364X",,,,108,0,0,7,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2040-4166,2040-4174,,INT J LEAN SIX SIG,Int.

In order to determine the dynamic interdependence between the indicated phenomena, econometric tools associated with the vector autoregression model were used, namely: Granger causality tests, impulse response function and variance decomposition of forecast errors. The tools used will not only identify the direction of the causal interdependence between the effects of sustainable logistics activities and the development of trade in recyclable raw materials, but also allow to determine the strength of the interaction between these variables. The conducted research shows that changes in the environmental effects of waste logistics activities are the Granger cause of changes occurring in the trade of renewable raw materials, especially in Hungary. Considering adequately delayed values of the synthetic development measure of the environmental effects of waste logistics increases the accuracy of predictions for changes in the trade of recyclable raw materials.","[Mesjasz-Lech, Agata] Czestochowa Tech Univ, Fac Management, PL-42201 Czestochowa, Poland; [Michelberger, Pal] Obuda Univ, Donat Banki Fac Mech & Safety Engn, H-1081 Budapest, Hungary","Mesjasz-Lech, A (corresponding author), Czestochowa Tech Univ, Fac Management, PL-42201 Czestochowa, Poland.",agata.mesjasz-lech@wz.pcz.pl,"Mesjasz-Lech, Agata/ABG-4393-2020","Michelberger, Pal/0000-0001-5752-0224",,,,68,1,1,2,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2019,11,15,,,,,,,4159,10.3390/su11154159,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,IW8FS,WOS:000485230200164,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

Marine protected areas (MPAs) serve important roles in conservation of marine biodiversity and ecosystem resilience, but their success is increasingly challenged in the face of such large-scale threats. Here, we illustrate the utility of adopting the interdisciplinary telecoupling framework to better understand effects that originate from distant places and cross MPA boundaries (e.g., polluted water circulation, anthropogenic noise transport, human and animal migration). We review evidence of distal processes affecting MPAs and the cutting-edge approaches currently used to investigate these processes. We then introduce the umbrella framework of telecoupling and explain how it can help address knowledge gaps that exist due to limitations of past approaches that are centered within individual disciplines. We then synthesize five examples from the recent telecoupling literature to explore how the telecoupling framework can be used for MPA research. These examples include the spatial subsidies approach, adapted social network analysis, telecoupled qualitative analysis, telecoupled supply chain analysis, and decision support tools for telecoupling. Our work highlights the potential for the telecoupling framework to better understand and address the mounting and interconnected socioeconomic and environmental sustainability challenges faced by the growing number of MPAs around the world.","[Hull, Vanessa; Rivera, Christian J.; Wong, Chad] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Hull, V (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",vhull@ufl.edu,,"Rivera, Christian J/0000-0002-3634-1558",,,,110,4,4,2,37,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2019,11,16,,,,,,,4450,10.3390/su11164450,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,IV7WA,WOS:000484476400002,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

The two objectives are economic (cost minimization) and environmental (greenhouse gas emissions minimization), respectively. The robust model is capable of incorporating decision makers' risk attitudes in addressing demand uncertainties under conditions of very limited historical data. The application of the proposed approach is examined using real data of an actual pharmaceutical supply chain as well as a benchmark problem in the existing literature. Our analysis and investigation focuses on exploring the extent to which the tradeoffs between economic and environmental objectives are influenced by the decision makers' risk preferences and postponement strategy. We find that independent of the amount of greenhouse gas emissions and degree of demand variability, the postponement strategy can consistently provide cost savings for the supply chain.","[Jabbarzadeh, Armin; Pourmehdi, Fahime] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Haughton, Michael] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Lazaridis Sch Business & Econ, 64 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C7, Canada; [Jabbarzadeh, Armin] ETS, Dept Automated Prod Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Haughton, M (corresponding author), Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Lazaridis Sch Business & Econ, 64 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C7, Canada.",arminj@iust.ac.ir; mhaughton@wlu.ca,,,Canada's Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [DDG-2015-00012],This research was supported by funding from Canada's Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC); Grant #DDG-2015-00012.

This study aims to minimize the cost and negative environmental effects. In order to find the best method to solve the problem of multiobjective function optimization, we propose a multiobjective location model which combines genetic algorithm with probabilistic robust optimization. The model first uses genetic algorithm to get preliminary result and then it uses probabilistic robust optimization to find the optimal solution. The preliminary results show that 1, 3, 5 of the candidate sites more cost-effective and environmentally friendly than other. The fitness value converges at a stable value of 1.55 x 10(-5), and the Pareto optimal frontier presents considerable clustering characteristics, which prove the rationality and operability of the site selection optimization model. Meanwhile, the robust model analysis under the given uncertain environment achieves the purpose of further optimization of the site. The research results can provide the government with a theoretical basis for the site selection of construction and demolition waste recycling plants. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Remanufacturing is a process in which the original functionality of End-of-Use (EoU) or End-of-Life (EoL) product is restored and the remanufactured product is treated as good as a new product. In spite of these advantages, remanufacturing is still not so popular and organized in developing countries like India. The developing countries encounter several problems in strategic, tactical and operational level of management while implementing the remanufacturing business option. In this paper attempts have been made to identify both the enablers and the barriers in managing business of EUL products through remanufacturing in India. Subsequently the structural relationships among the enablers and barriers have been modelled in this paper. Initially an extensive literature review is carried out to identify the factors depicting the enablers and barriers. Then, Fuzzy Interpretive Structural Modeling (FISM) is applied to develop and evaluate the structural relationships among the identified factors. The application of FISM helps in understanding the effect of major enablers and barriers in extending useful life of automotive products through remanufacturing. The outcome of FISM based analysis shows that low cost, price sensitive market, cheap labour cost, and fast turnaround are the major enablers for OEM in initiating EUL business practice through remanufacturing, whereas the major barriers are lack of proper design of product, stringent foreign trade policy, cannibalization of new product, lack of proper remarketing strategies, lack of reverse network design, lack of proper maintaining the database of the customers, seller reputation and identity. The analysis is further enriched by MICMAC technique, which leads to getting an insight on the significance of the dependence and driving power of both the enablers and barriers.

The demands, rate of return and the quality of returned products stand as an uncertain parameter. The considered chain, based on the study of a dairy company, is a multi-period and multi-product that comprises suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses, retailers and collection centers. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is projected to minimize the cost and environmental pollutant, simultaneously. Besides, an innovative MILP robust model is developed for the problem under uncertainty. Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, the research has developed an efficient heuristic, named YAG, to solve large-sized problems. Computational experiments conducted indicating that the YAG method has an average gap of less than 1.65 percent from the optimal solution within a reasonable time. Also, the YAG method finds the optimal solution in more than 34 percent of instances. The performance of the robust approach and the heuristic method is examined in a real case study and a diverse range of problems. The results revealed that the robust model compared to the deterministic model has better quality and seem quite more reliable. The effect of the product's lifetime, bi-objective modeling and environmental pollutant are considered throughout the study. The results indicate that the effects of products' lifetime and level of uncertainty vary for cost and environmental pollution objectives. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, many barriers are hindering the promotion of PH, for instance, cost, lack of regulations, and the shortage of knowledge, among which cost is identified as one of the most critical barriers. Unlike previous studies focused only on production costs, this research aims to investigate transaction costs (TCs), e.g., searching costs, negotiation costs, and enforcement costs. First, this paper develops a theoretical TCs framework of the PH supply chain, based on an extensive literature review. Secondly, an empirical study was conducted on two cases in Chongqing to validate the TCs framework. Key stake-holders are identified by Social Network Analysis (SNA). Subsequently, 25 semi-structured interviews were conducted with key stakeholders, both to verify the new TCs framework and to explore stakeholder concerns about TCs. The centrality metrics by SNA identified six key stakeholders who have a significant influence on TCs. It is found from the interviews that both the conceptual phase and the construction phase are stages where the majority of TCs occur. Both the developer and the general contractor are paying for more TCs compared to the other stakeholders. This study contributes to theory by initially introducing the concepts of TCs to the PH field, and the findings bring implications on the governance of PH supply chain to both private stakeholders and the government.

Improving the service quality of the last mile delivery is an important measure to promote the sustainable development of rural e-commerce logistics. However, such work is challenging because the current rural last mile delivery is inefficient and unsustainable and is influenced by a set of interacting factors. It is necessary to explore the relationships among the sustainability influencing factors of rural last mile delivery. A total of 15 sustainability influencing factors are selected. The improved fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) is used to assign the weights of the factors and then the interpretative structural model (ISM) is used to determine the hierarchical structure of each factor.

The paper attempts to measure comprehensive relative reconfigurability index (CRRI) in an automobile case supply chain by holistically considering fifteen enablers of reconfigurability.

Firstly, a deterministic assessment model is developed from the total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) digraph, and secondly, an integrated assessment methodology that utilizes both the Delphi technique and the additive weighting method to calculate RRI. The uniqueness of the present research is to quantify reconfigurability in the case supply chain by a numerical index termed as CRRI. The paper analyzes the level of reconfigurability competence of the case supply chain in comparison with an ideal supply chain and thus facilitates structural flexibility. The proposed model for calculating CRRI, using two methodologies and comparing the results, is an innovative way of measuring supply chain reconfigurability. Supply chain's preparedness to structurally change in the present business environment of uncertainty and turbulence can be evaluated and it would act as an aide in decision making pertaining to reconfigurability in supply chains.","[Biswas, Pallab] Ajay Kumar Garg Engn Coll, Dept Mech Engn, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Kumar, Sameer] Univ St Thomas, Opus Coll Business, Operat & Supply Chain Management, 1000 LaSalle Ave, Minneapolis, MN 55403 USA; [Jai, Vipul] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Management, Victoria Business Sch, 23 Lambton Quay,Pipitea Campus,POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Chandra, Charu] Univ Michigan, Coll Business Adm, Dept Management Studies, FCS 183,19000 Hubbard Dr, Dearborn, MI 48126 USA","Kumar, S (corresponding author), Univ St Thomas, Opus Coll Business, Operat & Supply Chain Management, 1000 LaSalle Ave, Minneapolis, MN 55403 USA.",sameerkumar724@gmail.com; Vipul.Jain@vuw.ac.nz; charu@umich.edu,,,,,,28,1,1,2,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0278-6125,1878-6642,,J MANUF SYST,J.

The concept of agent and agent functions can help to automate a variety of difficult tasks and assist decision-making in flow-shop production. This is especially so in the large-scale Original Equipment Manufacturing (OEM) industry, which is associated with many uncertainties. Among these are uncertainties in customer demand requirements that create disruptions that impact production planning and scheduling, hence, making it difficult to satisfy demand in due time, in the right order delivery sequence, and in the right item quantities. It is however important to devise means of adapting to these inevitable disruptive problems by accommodating them while minimising the impact on production performance and customer satisfaction. In this paper, an innovative embedded agent-based Production Disruption Inventory-Replenishment (PDIR) framework, which includes a novel adaptive heuristic algorithm and inventory replenishment strategy which is proposed to tackle the disruption problems. The capabilities and functionalities of agents are utilised to simulate the flow-shop production environment and aid learning and decision making. In practice, the proposed approach is implemented through a set of experiments conducted as a case study of an automobile parts facility for a real life large-scale OEM. The results are presented in term of Key Performance Indicators (CPIs), such as the number of late/unsatisfied orders, to determine the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results reveal a minimum number of late/unsatisfied orders, when compared with other approaches.","[Adediran, Tunde, V; Al-Bazi, Ammar] Coventry Univ, Fac Engn Environm & Comp, Coventry CV1 5FB, W Midlands, England; [dos Santos, Luiz Eduardo] Fac Integradas UPIS, SEPS 712-912, BR-70390125 Brasilia, DF, Brazil","Al-Bazi, A (corresponding author), Coventry Univ, Fac Engn Environm & Comp, Coventry CV1 5FB, W Midlands, England.",adedirat@uni.coventry.ac.uk; aa8535@coventry.ac.uk; eduardo@neocode.com.br,,"Al-Bazi, Ammar/0000-0002-5057-4171",,,,53,3,3,3,15,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-8352,1879-0550,,COMPUT IND ENG,Comput.

ABM is a bottom-up approach for modeling the dynamics of interactions among individuals and complex combinations of various factors (e.g., economic, social or environmental). Our agent-based contract farming model focuses on two critical components of contractual relationship, namely financial incentives and trust. We incorporate the actual recurrent fluctuations of spot market prices, which induce both contractor and farmeragents to renege on the agreement. The agent-based model is then used to predict emergent system-wide behaviors and compare counterfactual scenarios of different policies and initiatives on maintaining the contract rice farming scheme. Simulation results firstly show that a fully-equipped contractor who opportunistically exploits a relatively small proportion (less than 10%) of the contracted farmers in most instances can outperform spot market-based contractors in terms of average profit achieved for each crop. Secondly, a committed contractor who offers lower purchasing prices than the most typical rate can obtain better earnings per ton of rice as well as higher profit per crop. However, those contractors in both cases could not enlarge their contract farming scheme, since eitherfarmers' trust toward them decreases gradually or their offers are unable to compete with the benefits from a competitor or the spot market. Thirdly, the results are also in agreement with the existing literature that the contract farming scheme is not a cost-effective method for buyers with limited rice processing capacity, which is a common situation among the contractors in the MKD region. These results yield significant insights into the difficulty in expanding the agricultural contracting program in the MKD's rice supply chain.","[Hung Khanh Nguyen; Chiong, Raymond; Chica, Manuel; Middleton, Richard H.] Univ Newcastle, Sch Elect Engn & Comp, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Chica, Manuel] Univ Granada, Andalusian Res Inst DaSCI, E-18014 Granada, Spain; [Dung Thi Kim Pham] Inst Policy & Strategy Agr & Rural Dev, 2B Tran Thanh Tong St,Pham Dinh Ho Ward, Hanoi, Vietnam","Chiong, R (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Elect Engn & Comp, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",raymond.chiong@newcastle.edu.au,"Chica, Manuel/F-6062-2011; Middleton, Richard/A-2950-2013","Chica, Manuel/0000-0002-4717-1056; Middleton, Richard/0000-0001-9885-8803","Australian Government Research Training Program scholarshipAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science; Ramon y Cajal programSpanish Government [RYC-2016-19800]","We would like to thank Michael Maes and the anonymous reviewers for their insightful and constructive feedback.

Recently, biomass has been received increasing attention due to its economic and environmental benefits. Olefin, as one of the key raw materials in petrochemical industries, is able to be produced from biomass feedstocks. This study presents a robust three-stage stochastic programming model to characterize and optimize an olefin supply chain/production network aiming to provide a reliable and economic logistics network to support olefin production. This model encompasses probabilistic scenarios and uncertainty sets to capture the seasonality of biomass feedstocks and the uncertainty of carbon tax rate, respectively. The Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is also involved in this model to complement the traditional biomass supplies to ensure the reliable feedstock for olefin production. To find the optimal solution of this model, a hybrid robust/stochastic approach is developed by integrating the affinely adjustable robust model with the sample average approximation (SAA) method. The state of Mississippi is used as a real case study to test and validate the proposed model and optimization approach. The results show that increasing feedstocks conversion rate by 20% and MSW recycling rate by 100% will increase olefin production by 17.26% and 14.3%, respectively, and increasing the carbon tax rate uncertainty from 0 to 30 will decrease the total network emissions by 2.8%. The proposed optimization approach will generate more robust and reliable results. These results indicate that the proposed model and optimization approach would benefit both economic and environmental perspectives in biomass based olefin production. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Environmental aspects, however, are often considered only rudimentarily. Based on previous research and real-world data, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model of a European reverse network for WEEE is developed, including collection, high-value recovery, or third-party collection and recycling. The results comprise optimal network decisions and corresponding opportunity costs for economic and 21 environmental categories (18 midpoints, 3 endpoints). The evaluation of the environmental impact is based on data from the ecoinvent database, characterized using the ReCiPe 2016 Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) method. The results unveil conflicts and congruencies between the objectives. Collection and high-value recovery are preferable in up to six countries for economically optimal networks and in up to 15 countries with optimal benefit for global warming and fossil resource depletion. Discrepancies in objective values are larger between economic and most of the environmental solutions than in between most of the environmental ones. The dimensions land use and freshwater eutrophication show the least conflicts with the economic rationale. Solutions for mineral resource depletion prefer third-party collection and recycling. Conflicts between solutions are resolved by the e-constraint method. Sensitivity analyses show the robustness of key findings. This study emphasizes the importance of a broad assessment of environmental impacts as well as mutual economic and environmental opportunity costs in large-scale recovery networks for WEEE.

Unfortunately, episodes of extreme weather have, in recent years, revealed vulnerabilities in global supply networks to high-impact events. With a possible increase in both frequency and intensity of these events due to climate change, supply chains are at risk of disruption now more than ever, with potential dire economic, societal, and environmental consequences. Acknowledging that the direct application of stochastic programming in this context can quickly lead to very large CPU times, we propose an algorithm that combines the sample average approximation method with a selection heuristic for extreme event scenarios. Our method allows to analyse the tradeoff between economic performance and disruption risk, identifying supply chain configurations which are more resilient against extreme events. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology in multiple case studies, showing how it identifies near optimal solutions in short CPU times. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

These determinants are input to an extended hybrid simulation model using system dynamics (SD), discrete event simulation (DES) and agent-based simulation (ABS) that tackles the needs imposed by activities of very different nature, as the project development and manufacturing/assembly operations. The hybrid model is applied to the case of an advanced manufacturing company. Through Monte Carlo sampling, the influence of different combinations of determinants in the performance variability is assessed. A correlation analysis shows evidence of association between all performance determinants and the project time and cost, while no evidence of association between the design reuse and project type determinants and the manufacturing and assembly time.","[Barbosa, Catia; Azevedo, Americo] Univ Porto, Fac Engn, Porto, Portugal; [Barbosa, Catia; Azevedo, Americo] Inesc TEC, Campus FEUP, Porto, Portugal","Barbosa, C (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Fac Engn, Porto, Portugal.; Barbosa, C (corresponding author), Inesc TEC, Campus FEUP, Porto, Portugal.",up201409940@fe.up.pt,"Lengruber, Albert/AAD-9113-2019; Azevedo, Americo/G-2763-2015","Lengruber, Albert/0000-0003-2977-9946; Azevedo, Americo/0000-0002-9659-5488","Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT)Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [PD/BD/105988/2014]; North Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE 2020), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, and through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) [NORTE01-0145-FEDER-000020]","This work was financially supported by the Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT) [grant number PD/BD/105988/2014].

Moreover, the evaluation process for prioritization of preparedness activities involves significant uncertainty and subjectivity. Therefore, this study integrates the fuzzy logic with analytical network process, a multi-criteria decision-making tool to analyze and present the ranking of selected preparedness activities. Results of this research indicate that human resource management activities are the most needed preparedness activities to mitigate the risk of cyclone disasters in the Indian context.

Firstly, identification of AM's capabilities in manufacturing final products in industry requires an accurate evaluation of their impacts across all supply chain stages. Secondly, making products additively entails potential consequences for different product lifecycle phases, e.g., design, preparation, production, usage, etc. that need to be managed accordingly. The current study tries to jointly address these two aspects by focusing on an extensive review of qualitative and quantitative cases taken from literature, as well as empirical observations made in industry. The study shows that impacts of AM technologies are not partial or isolated disruptions, but rather encompass a range of changes whose overall consequences spread across different phases of supply chain. Another result of the study is that a benchmarking of AM and conventional technologies on their overall performance is exhaustive only when all features of productions and logistics networks are evaluated simultaneously, rather than in their isolated states.","[Zanoni, Simone; Ashourpour, Milad; Bacchetti, Andrea; Zanardini, Massimo; Perona, Marco] Univ Brescia, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Brescia, Italy","Zanoni, S (corresponding author), Univ Brescia, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Brescia, Italy.",simone.zanoni@unibs.it; milad.ash@gmail.com; andrea.bacchetti@unibs.it; massimo.zanardini@unibs.it; marco.perona@unibs.it,"Zanoni, Simone/AAD-8838-2021; POUR, MILAD ASHOUR/AAL-4268-2020; Zanoni, Simone/D-3052-2011","POUR, MILAD ASHOUR/0000-0001-8504-9935; PERONA, MARCO/0000-0002-9082-2950; Zanoni, Simone/0000-0001-5324-6117",,,,63,10,10,2,13,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0268-3768,1433-3015,,INT J ADV MANUF TECH,Int.

The rapid expansion of DFCs is needed to improve supply chain efficiency. DFCs have potential to decongest existing rail networks, reduce the modal share of road freight transportation, and decarbonize freight transport sector. This study attempts to use transition management theory for identifying enablers of DFC for the transition from road to rail freight transportation. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is employed to confirm the three-level transition management framework for these enablers. This paper also proposes an eight-level hierarchical total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) based model for explicating the inter-relationships among the enablers of DFC to decarbonize freight transportation and achieve sustainability in the freight transport sector. Eventually, this paper provides empirical evidence to identify and validate the enablers of DFC through the lens of transition management theory. This paper also highlights the role of 'adoption of advanced technologies' to achieve sustainability in freight transportation. The outcomes of this study also facilitate policy-makers in understanding and managing the key enablers of DFCs to decarbonize freight transport sector.","[Shankar, Ravi] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Management Studies, Decis Sci, New Delhi, India; [Shankar, Ravi] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Management Studies, Operat & Supply Chain Management, New Delhi, India; [Pathak, Devendra Kumar] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Management Studies, New Delhi, India; [Choudhary, Devendra] Govt Engn Coll, Dept Mech Engn, Ajmer, Rajasthan, India","Shankar, R (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Management Studies, Decis Sci, New Delhi, India.; Shankar, R (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Management Studies, Operat & Supply Chain Management, New Delhi, India.",ravil@dms.iitd.ac.in,"Pathak, Devendra Kumar/AAT-9014-2020; Choudhary, Devendra/B-3343-2014","Pathak, Devendra Kumar/0000-0001-8639-6592; Choudhary, Devendra/0000-0003-2390-1437",,,,96,6,6,3,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0040-1625,1873-5509,,TECHNOL FORECAST SOC,Technol.

The hegemonic certified system, governed by Fairtrade International, has seen some high-profile withdrawals by major processors and retailers in recent months, which is leading to both proponents and critics questioning who, and what, the system is for. While the certified system has seen increasing conventionalisation, there remains at its core a mission to make trade fair, empower those marginalised in global trade and foster sustainable livelihoods. Taking a global production network (GPN) framework supports a critical exploration of the market, social and political asymmetries of this international system of production and distribution. Drawing on empirical evidence from the wine industry, this paper uses a production-space perspective to critically reflect on some of the key relations within Fairtrade GPNs. While there are many positive impacts, particularly in social development, producers have experienced a conventionalisation of supply chains, a lack of contextual responsiveness and limited engagement with the global system. These indicate a continuation of power asymmetries that are intersecting, multiscalar and evolving. Although these are from wine industry case studies, anecdotal evidence suggests that they are not uncommon experiences and even a hint of unfair, disempowering and unsustainable trading practices negatively impacts both these producers' livelihoods and the reputation of the Fairtrade system as a whole. Nonetheless, there remains significant producer buy-in indicating that the ideals of Fairtrade retain currency. This therefore presents a critical opportunity for Fairtrade to actively address the market, social and political inequalities that persist in its GPNs and re-establish itself as a leader in the ethical marketplace.","[Herman, Agatha] Cardiff Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales","Herman, A (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",HermanA@cardiff.ac.uk,,"Herman, Agatha/0000-0003-0646-9726",Leverhulme TrustLeverhulme Trust [ECF-2014-410]; British CouncilThe British Council in India,"The Leverhulme Trust, Grant/Award Number: ECF-2014-410; The British Council",,30,3,3,3,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-0894,1475-4762,,AREA,Area,JUN,2019,51,2,,,,,332,339,,10.1111/area.12467,,,8,Geography,Geography,HX3CS,WOS:000467269700017,,Green Accepted,,,2021-03-04

Supply chains provisioning the public sector, incorporating a vast array of materials used in public services such as education, health, social housing and transportation, have been under-researched and under-theorised in the geographical and wider social science literature on Global Production Networks, Global Value Chains and consumption ethics. Against this backdrop, the paper evaluates the emergence of ethical trading programmes involving labour standards in UK public sector sourcing, drawing on examples from the health, higher education, construction and transportation sectors and a methodology combining interviews with participant observation. Findings show that ethical public procurement is shaped, and often constrained, by: the relatively low profile of many materials used in public services, which challenge effective campaigning and advocacy work; the consequent limits to reputational risk for state departments and first-tier suppliers if labour issues are encountered in their supply chains; and the significant role of EU and UK procurement law, which until 2014 rendered social responsibility in public sector sourcing a legal risk to specify. Through a practice-orientated approach and adopting the notion of responsibilisation inspired by governmentality perspectives, the paper grasps how these challenges for ethical public procurement are encountered and negotiated by procurement managers and those influencing them in a neoliberal environment. It is shown that ethical sourcing is significantly less advanced in the UK public sector than it is in consumer goods sectors, with implications for social justice in a whole realm of under-researched global supply chains.","[Hughes, Alex] Newcastle Univ, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Morrison, Eilidh; Ruwanpura, Kanchana N.] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Geog, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","Hughes, A (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",Alex.Hughes@ncl.ac.uk,,"Hughes, Alex/0000-0001-5163-5610",Newcastle University Faculty Research Fund,Newcastle University Faculty Research Fund,,37,7,7,3,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-2754,1475-5661,,T I BRIT GEOGR,Trans.

A shift is required towards biocentric, transdisciplinarity-based solutions, to mitigate rebound effects and unintended, negative effects. In the field of Sustainable Supply Network Design, such shift implies on developing resilient solutions that maximize environmental benefits instead of minimizing environmental impacts. Recent researches have showed progress in this direction proposing more integrative approaches, but a framework to design supply networks with the purpose of environmental regeneration is yet to be proposed. This research aims to fill this gap, merging concepts from Regenerative Design, Transdisciplinary Research, Systems Thinking, Social Sciences and Design Sciences. Such framework is regarded as an artefact, and Design Science Research Methodology used for its development: a main problem is identified, objectives for a solution are drawn and the framework is designed. First, the Regenerative Supply Network Design is defined, to guide the elaboration of the Regenerative Supply Chain Design framework, consisting of six steps: (i) description of the network surroundings and identification of a regenerative purpose; (ii) redesign of outputs (iii) network conceptualization, (iv) optimize performance, (v) choose configuration, and (vi) implementation. Among the implications of this research are that (i) practitioners basing their design process in this framework are effectively shifting from anthropocentrism to biocentrism with a clear, defined purpose of environmental restoration and (ii), that the supply networks evolve in the integration with the environment, enhancing eco-systems resilience.

Since it is a complex procedure that requires an adequate system, the recent trend consists in outsourcing RL to third-party reverse logistics providers (3PRLPs). This paper provides the background of sustainable triple bottom line theory with focus on economic, environmental, and social aspects under 3PRL concerns. The relevant sustainability criteria are used in a case study conducted in cooperation with an Indian automotive remanufacturing company. To select the most preferred service provider, we use a hybrid method combining a variant of ELECTRE I accounting for the effect of reinforced preference, the revised Simos procedure, and Stochastic Multi-criteria Acceptability Analysis. The incorporated approach exploits all parameters of an outranking model compatible with the incomplete preference information of the Decision Maker. In particular, it derives the newly defined kernel acceptability and membership indices that can be interpreted as a support given to the selection of either a particular subset of alternatives or a single option. The proposed ELECTRE-based method enriches the spectrum of multiple criteria decision analysis approaches that can be used to effectively approach the problem of the 3PRLP selection. As indicated by the extensive review presented in the paper, this application field was so far dominated by Analytic Hierarchy Process and TOPSIS, whose weaknesses can be overcome by applying the outranking methods.

Design/methodology/approach Multiple case study analysis of 14 firms in the food sector is presented in the context of the UK's impending exit from the European Union (Brexit). Organisations studied include farmers, processors, retailers and non-government organisations (NGOs). Data from interviews and roundtable discussions has been interpreted using the dynamic capabilities perspective, covering the sensing, seizing, and transforming stages. Findings The data highlights the importance of both vertical and horizontal collaboration between supply chain actors as they seek to anticipate the impact of the disruption and influence the future shape of the constitution.

These standards entail increased levels of complexity to be addressed by appropriately designed tools, such as the Voting Analytic Hierarchy Process (VAHP) proposed by Liu and Hai (2005). This method of multi-criteria group decision making structures decision criteria in a hierarchical fashion as per Saaty's Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and employs data envelopment analysis (DEA) for deriving criteria weights from the ordinal preferences of the group members. Compared to AHP, the method permits a simpler application in a group decision context. However, its theoretical underpinnings have been questioned in the literature. This specifically concerns (i) the requirement of a strong convex order for the importance weights of ordinal rank gradations, and (ii) the choice of discrimination threshold for consecutive rank weights in the underlying DEA model. We propose a revised VAHP method that overcomes both issues (i) and (ii) by pursuing a game-theoretic approach to elicitation of criteria weights - so as to remove subjectivity from rank discrimination. We illustrate the application of the method on a real-world problem of sustainable supplier selection. We contribute to theory by proposing a more robust VAHP tool that helps supply chain and purchasing managers selecting suppliers based on a comprehensive set of criteria spanning all three sustain ability dimensions (economic, environmental, and social), while coping with parsimonious input by group decision-makers.","[Pishchulov, Grigory] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Booth St West, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England; [Pishchulov, Grigory] St Petersburg State Univ, 7-9 Univ Skaya Nab, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; [Trautrims, Alexander; Chesney, Thomas] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England; [Gold, Stefan] Univ Kassel, Fac Econ & Management, Kassel, Germany; [Schwab, Leila] Univ Neuchatel, Chair Operat Prod & Logist Management, Neuchatel, Switzerland","Pishchulov, G (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Booth St West, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England.",grigory.pishchulov@manchester.ac.uk; alexander.trautrims@nottingham.ac.uk; thomas.chesney@nottingham.ac.uk; gold@uni-kassel.de; leila.schwab@unine.ch,"Trautrims, Alexander/B-6896-2013; Pishchulov, Grigory/M-9405-2016","Trautrims, Alexander/0000-0001-8428-3682; Pishchulov, Grigory/0000-0001-8787-1869; Gold, Stefan/0000-0001-9945-742X",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [723336],"We are thankful to Konrad Zimmer, Magnus Frohling and Frank Schultmann of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany, for providing us with the list of supplier selection criteria identified in their research, and to Nikolay Kazantsev of the University of Manchester, UK, for his help with criteria matching.

Transportation is a key component of that system, as it accounts for a significant portion of the delivered cost. One of the most critical factors affecting transportation cost is the interrelationship between feedstock sources and facility locations, including plant and off-plant transfer / storage facilities. At the same time, biomass energy sustainability is sensitive to the performance of each component in the entire process. The main goal of this study is to build a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that uses region-specific data to minimize sustainable transportation costs. This consists of economic, environmental, and societal factors. The upstream air emissions as a result of residues collection at the forest, transloading, and transportation by truck or multimodally (truck and rail), which include greenhouse gases (GHG), particulate matter (PM), and nitrogen oxides (NOx), are calculated and included in the analysis. The model was tested on a case study that evaluated transportation costs for nine alternative plant locations in the state of Wisconsin. The results revealed that when equally weighed, external (social and environmental) costs accounted for a considerable portion of total transportation cost (approximately 26-37%). The study also shows that total upstream GHG and air emissions increased as the plant capacity increased, due to the longer transportation distances, but per unit emissions decreased.

To deal with the uncertainty of the parameters of the proposed model, a novel formulation of a possibilistic programming model based on possibilistic mean and absolute deviation of fuzzy numbers is proposed. The proposed model, called the possibilistic mean-absolute deviation model, utilizes not only the advantages of previous possibilistic programming methods, such as simultaneously handling the uncertainty and the flexibility in goals and constraints, but also balances mean and risk values of an objective function, including uncertain coefficients according to Decision-Maker's (DM) preferences. A real case study is conducted in Iran to evaluate the performance and efficiency of the proposed model. The proposed approach has better performance than a pure possibilistic programming model, and its results are justified by the robust possibilistic programming approaches.","[Babazadeh, Reza] Urmia Univ, Fac Engn, Orumiyeh, West Azerbaijan, Iran","Babazadeh, R (corresponding author), Urmia Univ, Fac Engn, Orumiyeh, West Azerbaijan, Iran.",r.babazadeh@urmia.ac.ir,,"Babazadeh, Reza/0000-0001-8070-6473",,,,76,2,2,0,7,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0888-5885,,,IND ENG CHEM RES,Ind.

In practice not all the required information is available in advance due to various sources of uncertainty in agri-food supply chains. In this research a multi-objective two-stage stochastic programming model is proposed to analyse and evaluate the economic and environmental impacts to account for uncertainty in agri-food supply chains. A mushroom supply chain in the Netherlands is presented as an illustrative case study. Optimal production planning decisions calculated with a two-stage stochastic programming model are compared with the results of an equivalent deterministic model. The results of the optimizations show that accounting for stochasticity in important model parameters can reduce the difference between expected and realized economic performance by approximately 4% on average. Moreover, this paper demonstrates that including stochastic model parameters can reduce the environmental impact without compromising the current economic performance. Given the assumptions in the setup of the case study and the available information, it is concluded that applying a 2-stage stochastic programming approach for production planning decisions can lead to improved economic and environmental performance in an agri-food supply chain. New findings in real-life case studies are needed to get profound insights and understanding on the impact of uncertainty on production planning decisions in sustainable agri-food supply chains.

Because of increasing public awareness and non-governmental organization (NGO) campaigns, seafood buyers have made various commitments to improve the sustainability of their wild seafood sourcing. As part of this effort, seafood suppliers have developed their own CSR programs in order to meet buyers' sourcing requirements. However, the CSR of these companies, many of which are mid-supply chain or vertically integrated, remain largely invisible and unstudied. In order to better understand how mid-chain seafood suppliers engage in sustainability efforts, we reviewed the CSR practices of the 25 largest seafood companies globally (by revenue) that deal with wild seafood products. Based on literature, existing frameworks, and initial data analysis, we developed a structured framework to identify and categorize practices based on the issues addressed and the approach used. We found companies implement CSR to address four key areas, and through various activities that fit into five categories: Power; Practices; Partnerships; Public policy; and Philanthropy. One of the biggest gaps identified in this study is the lack of accountability mechanisms, as well as robust and consistent accounting of impacts. Indeed, many companies express commitments without clear goals and structures in place to ensure implementation. Therefore, improvements in seafood company performance on social and environmental aspects may not only require creating a better business case for CSR, but also require ensuring that companies have the necessary processes and structures in place through public oversights and regulations.","[Packer, Helen; Bailey, Megan] Dalhousie Univ, Marine Affairs Program, Fac Sci, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Packer, Helen] Anova Food USA, 280 10th Ave, San Diego, CA 92101 USA; [Swartz, Wilf] Univ British Columbia, Inst Oceans & Fisheries, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Swartz, Wilf; Ota, Yoshitaka] Univ British Columbia, Nippon Fdn, Nereus Program, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Ota, Yoshitaka] Univ Washington, Sch Marine & Environm Affairs, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Packer, H (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Marine Affairs Program, Fac Sci, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.; Packer, H (corresponding author), Anova Food USA, 280 10th Ave, San Diego, CA 92101 USA.",helen.packer@dal.ca; w.swartz@oceans.ubc.ca; yoshitakaota@me.com; megan.bailey@dal.ca,,"Packer, Helen/0000-0001-7933-8095",Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Canada through the NSERC CREATE Transatlantic Ocean System Science and Technology (TOSST) grantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"The Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Canada provided funding for this project, in particular to H.P. through the NSERC CREATE Transatlantic Ocean System Science and Technology (TOSST) grant.",,97,7,7,1,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR 2,2019,11,8,,,,,,,2254,10.3390/su11082254,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HX9TU,WOS:000467752200067,,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2021-03-04

To establish a sustainable solution that resists accidents and disasters, a distributed system is required. To supply high-quality tap water using the existing water-supply network, rechlorination facilities must be installed to secure residual chlorine at the pipe end. In this study, a process is developed to determine the injection points and dosages of rechlorination using the latest pressure-driven analysis. The method was compared to the results of demand driven analysis methods. The proposed model was applied to P City in Korea to draw results. A detailed evaluation was performed to study how water pressure head and demand-based hydraulic and water quality analysis results impact the injection points and dosages of rechlorination. Thus, the existing demand-based model shows significant spatial deviations in the pressure head in the presence of water pressure drops, which subsequently lead to over-estimation of chlorine injection dosages for maintaining the concentration of residual chlorine. However, the proposed model involves a numerically validated theory and draws more reasonable results for hydraulic, water quality, and rechlorination dosages. The proposed model can be used as a decision-making tool based on hydraulic analysis for the supply of water of a stable quality.","[Lee, Sang Myoung; Kim, Joong Hoon] Korea Univ, Sch Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Lee, Ho Min] Korea Univ, Res Ctr Disaster Prevent Sci & Technol, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Yoo, Do Guen] Univ Suwon, Dept Civil Engn, Gyeonggi Do 18323, South Korea","Kim, JH (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Sch Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",waterman@korea.ac.kr; dlgh86@korea.ac.kr; godqhr425@naver.com; jaykim@korea.ac.kr,"Kim, Joong Hoon/F-7899-2011",,National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea - Korean government (MSIP) [2016R1A2A1A05005306],"This work was supported by a grant from the National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea, funded by the Korean government (MSIP) (No. 2016R1A2A1A05005306).",,30,3,3,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,APR,2019,11,4,,,,,,,697,10.3390/w11040697,,,18,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,IF5FC,WOS:000473105700067,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

For that reason, a sustainable supply chain network design (SSND) has been recently developed as a means of dealing with environmental and social issues along with the economic aspect of a supply chain. On the other hand, considering uncertainty and risk aversion in the supply chain network design due to the volatility of the markets and the unavailability of sufficient information is inevitable. Thus, in this paper, a risk-averse sustainable multi-objective mathematical model is proposed in order to design and plan a network of the supply chain under uncertainty by incorporating Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) into the basic configuration of the two-stage stochastic programming. In some other cases, many organizations offer some sort of discount to their customers so that they can compete with their rivals and enhance their accounts receivable. So, it seems ineluctable for companies to contemplate considering discount policies while making such strategic decisions for sustainability. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem in order to consider discounts in the proposed model. Sensitivity analyses are also conducted on some important risk-aversion parameters in order to evaluate how these parameters affect the proposed mathematical model and the obtained Pareto solutions.","[Rahimi, Mohsen; Ghezavati, Vahidreza] Islamic Azad Univ, Sch Ind Engn, South Tehran Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Asadi, Farshid] Southern Methodist Univ, Lyle Sch Engn, Dallas, TX 75205 USA","Ghezavati, V (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Sch Ind Engn, South Tehran Branch, Tehran, Iran.",v_ghezavati@azad.ac.ir,"Asadi, Farshid/AAE-6446-2019","Asadi, Farshid/0000-0003-2553-6808",,,,70,9,9,6,28,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-8352,1879-0550,,COMPUT IND ENG,Comput.

The proposed approach utilizes a novel multi-objective mathematical model by incorporating both quantitative and qualitative factors to comprehensively model the investigated case study. In the proposed model, the quantitative factors aim to minimize the loss of product freshness and total cost of the network. Moreover, the number of collection facilities, which are capable of collecting blood, are maximized through a formulation based upon qualitative criteria. Moreover, to cope with the uncertainty, a robust optimization approach is utilized, and an interactive fuzzy solution approach is applied to solve the proposed multi-objective model. The computational results demonstrate the capability of the proposed model in designing the blood supply chain network in practice. Moreover, some sensitivity analyses are conducted to show the findings observed in a real case study. The results show that the decision makers should be aware of quality-based requirements, because of significant impact on blood facility location, besides the cost oriented consideration. Moreover, concerning of uncertainty, the results obtained from the robust approach outweigh those of the deterministic one. Finally, based on the finding, helpful managerial insights are provided for the decision makers in the blood supply chain network design.","[Samani, Mohammad Reza Ghatreh; Hosseini-Motlagh, Seyyed-Mandi; Ghannadpour, Seyed Farid] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Ind Engn, Univ Ave, Namiak 16846, Iran","Hosseini-Motlagh, SM (corresponding author), Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Ind Engn, Univ Ave, Namiak 16846, Iran.",mr_samani@ind.iust.ac.ir; motlagh@iust.ac.ir; ghannadpour@iust.ac.ir,"Hosseini-Motlagh, Seyyed-Mahdi/L-5523-2018; ghannadpour, seyed farid/S-9331-2018","Hosseini-Motlagh, Seyyed-Mahdi/0000-0003-2568-187X; ghannadpour, seyed farid/0000-0002-5956-1262",,,,61,11,11,3,6,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-8352,1879-0550,,COMPUT IND ENG,Comput.

Accordingly, business and industrial organizations try to seek green supply chain strategies to respond to market pressure regarding corporate social responsibility. Green supplier selection is one of the practical strategies for modern enterprises. With the large-scale development of the palm oil products industry, green supplier selection technique is the key for decision making when dealing with mass information and possible risks of biased data. For instance, the preference of decision makers possibly causes a misleading decision, thus leading to unnecessary waste of resources. Therefore, the contribution of this paper is to apply the integrated multi-criteria decision method using the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory' (fuzzy DEMATEL) method to consider the cause and effect relationship and then using fuzzy analytic network process (fuzzy ANP) to assign the weight of each relevant criteria. The initial results are useful for strategic procurement planning. In the final step, we adopt the prospect theory to synthesize procurement's psychological and behavioral factors when selecting green suppliers. The final result refers to the comprehensive prospect value to rank the eligible suppliers into orders. Moreover, the results of both sensitivity analysis and comparison method confirm that the proposed model is adequately realistic and robust.","[Phochanikorn, Patchara; Tan, Chunqiao] Cent S Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Tan, Chunqiao] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Tan, CQ (corresponding author), Cent S Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China.; Tan, CQ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",151608001@csu.edu.cn; chungqiaot@mail.csu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71671188]; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [2016JJ1024]","This work was partly supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 71671188), and Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China (no. 2016JJ1024).",,52,15,15,3,25,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR 1,2019,11,7,,,,,,,1872,10.3390/su11071872,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HW2WV,WOS:000466551600049,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

To reconcile the relationship between energy and water, we carry on a case study in Shanxi Province and use input-output tables in 2007 and 2012 to measure the betweenness of sectors. Results shows that Mining and Processing of Metal Ores is the key transmission sector measured by betweenness-based method but usually ignored by other existing methods. Moreover, tertiary industry, such as Transportation, Storage and Posts, Hotel and Restaurants, plays an increasing significant role as transmission centers in the upstream supply chains. Efficiency improvement in these sectors may also help reduce water stress in the energy production.

The PCA method is used for ranking and filtering the suppliers, constituting the first layer of the supply chain, based on agility criteria. The proposed MOPMIP model is employed to construct the agile supply chain network under uncertainty. In the proposed MOPMIP model, three objective functions including 1) total costs minimization, 2) total delivery time minimization and 3) maximization of flexibility are considered.

China's traditional power generation groups (TPGGs), with assets all over the country, are, due to a lack of market awareness about energy policies, facing serious challenges in developing competitive advantages, improving power transaction modes, optimizing profit models, and even realizing basic corporate strategies. In this study, we focus on identifying the key factors influencing sustainable development in an unprecedented market environment for TPGGs, so as to achieve overall sustainable development for the whole power generation sector in China. A hybrid framework based on Multiple-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) was proposed to recognize the key influencing factors under vague rule conditions. We developed a novel method combining three different MCDM methods with triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs), fuzzy Delphi, fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), and Analytic Network Process (ANP), to cover uncertainty and make the problem-solving approach closer to the actual problem. A series of analyses indicate that the final 14 factors covering the five dimensions are considered to be important factors in the sustainable development of TPGGs. Based on the results, it can be said that Gross energy margin and Pricing bidding strategy dominate the impacts of TPGG's sustainable development. Finally, we give some advice relating to practical measures to help TPGGs achieve sustainable development in the market-oriented industry environment.","[Dong, Jun; Liu, Dongran; Wang, Dongxue; Zhang, Qi] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China","Liu, DR (corresponding author), North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",dongjun624@126.com; 1182106008@ncepu.edu.cn; 18101397665@163.com; zq@ncepu.edu.cn,,,"111 projectMinistry of Education, China - 111 Project [B18021]; China Three Gorges consulting project",This study is supported by the 111 project (B18021) and China Three Gorges consulting project.,,78,1,1,1,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR 22,2019,11,6,,,,,,,1754,10.3390/su11061754,,,30,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HT1UQ,WOS:000464350400021,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

Considering the service negative spillover effect, this paper investigates the horizontal Stackelberg competition and optimal service decision in two competing manufacturer-led supply chains. Four competitive structure models are constructed and the corresponding equilibrium solutions are obtained. By comparing the equilibrium results of four different structures, it is found that the service negative spillover effect and competition between supply chains have negative incentive effect on service providers and their supply chains. However, the chain-to-chain competition will benefit the supply chain that does not provide services from free-riding effect, which will be intensified with the intensification of competition. In addition, from the perspective of supply chain network and externality, we find that when the structure of one supply chain remains fixed and the other changes from centralized to decentralized, there will be a double marginalization effect. At the same time, the structural change from centralized to decentralized has certain altruism, that is, positive network externality, so as to improve the rival's performance significantly.","[Wu, Yucai; Wang, Jiguang; Li, Changhong] Shanxi Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Taiyuan 030006, Shanxi, Peoples R China","Wu, YC (corresponding author), Shanxi Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Taiyuan 030006, Shanxi, Peoples R China.",wuyucai1991@email.sxu.edu.cn; wangjg@sxu.edu.cn; lch7320@sxu.edu.cn,,"Wu, Yucai/0000-0001-5997-5310; Wang, Jiguang/0000-0002-0724-7300",MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [16YJC630116],This research was funded by the MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (grant number 16YJC630116).,,32,4,4,2,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR 17,2019,11,6,,,,,,,1612,10.3390/su11061612,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HT1TE,WOS:000464346600003,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

As such, long-term management strategies need to improve the resilience of water supply systems and account for the sustainability of water withdrawals. In this context, metabolic modelling may provide a support to decision-making in the medium-long term, based on sustainability criteria. This approach enables mimicking a water supply network (WSN) based on a set of material and energy fluxes that interact and influence each other. By analyzing these fluxes, a suite of key performance indicators (KPIs) is evaluated in order to identify which kind of interventions may be applied to increase the sustainability of the system. Here, we apply a metabolic model, WaterMet(2), to a WSN in the Reggio Emilia Province (Italy), combined with hydraulic simulations conducted with EPANET. Different alternative strategies are compared, including a reduction of water withdrawals from the main well field due to a possible future decrease in water availability.

We analyze the strategic choices of two competing downstream firms who simultaneously decide whether or not to co-create with an upstream supplier. Within this framework we incorporate endogenous pricing and effort choices by the upstream supplier and the downstream firms. Downstream firms contemplating co-creation with a supplier are faced with a trade-off. On the one hand they can benefit from the supplier's innovation efforts and therefore obtain a better product. On the other hand, they are confronted with the adverse effect of their own innovation efforts spilling over to their rivals via the supplier who would sell the co-created product to all firms. Our model captures this tension and offers several insights. First, we show that all the channel members (the supplier and the firms) are getting higher profits when they all co-create together, as compared to the situation where there is no co creation and the Supplier alone designs the product. However, we also demonstrate that the abovementioned trade-offs provide an incentive for firms to deviate from this outcome, sometimes resulting in no-co-creation between the downstream firms and upstream supplier in equilibrium. Further, we show that in the competitive co-creation environment, ex-ante symmetric firms may pursue asymmetric strategies in equilibrium. The asymmetric equilibrium, in which only one of the two firms co-creates with the supplier, is obtained when the degree of price sensitivity to competitor's product in the consumer market is moderate. Third, we find two types of asymmetric equilibria. For moderately low degrees of price sensitivity, all parties prefer the asymmetric outcome. For moderately high price sensitivity, both firms prefer co-creation, but the supplier will refuse to co-create with one of them thereby enforcing the asymmetric outcome. Thus, a strategic supplier's role is critical in that it expands the region where the asymmetric equilibrium takes place, beyond the one preferred by the firms themselves. We also show that, when firms compete in the end-consumer market, the supplier may exert lower innovation effort when it co-creates with two firms as compared to one. This is not the case in the absence of competition between the downstream firms. Finally, and counterintuitively, a higher degree of product fit for the rival can actually benefit the co-creating firm in the asymmetric outcome, even though it improves its rival's product.

Studies show that consumers are getting cognizant of environment preservation and prefer low-carbon developed products. It is seen that in some cases, customers are willing to pay even more for products developed using low carbon emission technologies. Furthermore, government initiatives towards going green has resulted in industries focusing on reducing their carbon footprints throughout the supply chain by employing green supply chain methodologies. In this study, we will develop an inventory model for deteriorating items in green supply chain considering recycling, reverse logistics and remanufacturing. Demand is assumed to be carbon dependent. Products are considered to be deteriorating in nature with time dependent deterioration rate. A crisp model is developed to minimize total average cost. In the crisp model, it is assumed that demand, deterioration and returned rate are precisely known. However, in reality these parameters are imprecise in nature. To model this impreciseness, a fuzzy model is developing considering these parameters as triangular fuzzy numbers. Total cost function is defuzzified using signed distance method and is shown to be convex and a unique solution exists.

Business continuity management (BCM) forms part of supply chain risk management and is an important competitive factor for companies by ensuring the smooth functioning of critical business processes in the case of failures. If business operations are severely disrupted, the companie's decision maker is confronted with a situation which is characterized by a high degree of uncertainty, complexity and time pressure. In such a context, decision support can be of significant value. This article presents a novel decision support methodology which leads to an improved and more robust BCM for severe disruptions caused by disasters. The methodology is part of the Reactive Disaster and supply chain Risk decision Support System (ReDRiSS) to deal with different levels of information availability and to provide decision makers with a robust decision recommendation regarding resource allocation problems. It combines scenario techniques, optimization models and approaches from decision theory to operate in an environment characterized by sparse or lacking information and dynamic changes over time. A simulation case study is presented where the methodology is applied within the BCM of a food retail company in Berlin that is affected by a pandemic disaster.","[Schaetter, Frank; Wiens, Marcus; Schultmann, Frank] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, IIP, Hertzstr 16, D-76187 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Hansen, Ole] KLU, Grosser Grasbrook 17, D-20457 Hamburg, Germany","Schatter, F (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, IIP, Hertzstr 16, D-76187 Karlsruhe, Germany.",frank.schaetter@kit.edu; ole.hansen@the-klu.org; marcus.wiens@kit.edu; frank.schultmann@kit.edu,"Schultmann, Frank/AAF-6300-2020; Wiens, Marcus/T-4022-2017","Wiens, Marcus/0000-0003-4158-3508",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF),We would like to thank the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) for financial support for this work within the research project SEAK.,,62,3,3,9,60,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-9236,1873-5797,,DECIS SUPPORT SYST,Decis.

We find that understanding the dynamics of forced labor in domestic supply chains requires us to conceptually modify the global value chain framework to understand similarities and differences across these contexts.

The textile industry cluster in most African economies has been threatened and is negatively affecting productivity, employment and revenue generation. Their survival, growth and sustainability are critical because of the sector's contribution to national development Objective: In this ariticle we investigate the role fators such as stakeholder relation among actors in the textile ecosystem, influence of supply chain networks, third-party pressures and technological changes affected the development of textile clusters in Ghana and how the country can rebuild the clusters. Method: Using partial least-square structural equation modelling techninque, we tested theoritical hypotheses using survey data from firms in the industrial enclave of Ghana. Result: The findings from the study acknowledges a sharp decline in the productivity and performance of firms in various industrial sectors especially the textile cluster. The influx of copycat products coupled with the firm's inability to adapt to changing production technology have been a key influencer in the deteriorating state of the textile industries. Again, gaps in stakeholder interactions and underutilised supply chain networks create bottlenecks that hinder the competitiveness and performance of these enterprises. Conclusion: On the contrary, findings from our study suggest external pressure from donors, multinationals and political influencers do not affect the performance and competitiveness of the textile sector as suggested by previous studies. Resuscitating the industry sector requires deliberate effort to improve coordination, information and technology sharing between key actors.","[Asare-Kyire, Lydia; Zheng, He] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Owusu, Ackah] Nobel Int Business Sch, Accra, Ghana","Owusu, A (corresponding author), Nobel Int Business Sch, Accra, Ghana.",ackah_owusu@yahoo.com,,"ASARE-KYIRE, LYDIA/0000-0002-0523-0863",,,,153,0,0,1,3,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2078-5585,2078-5976,,S AFR J BUS MANAG,S.

Practically, involved parameters' value does not remain constant as planning periods due to fluctuation in the demand and their market dynamics. Therefore, dynamicity in the parameter is considered as an important factor when a company forms a responsive chain through most eligible suppliers with respect to planning periods. This area of study may be considered for their complexities to the approaches toward order-allocations with bi-products of unused and repair spare-parts. Design/methodology/approach An integrated methodology of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and mixed-integer non-linear programming (MILP) is implemented in the two stages during each planning periods. In the first stage, AHP is used to obtain the relative weights with respect to each spare-parts of each criterion and based on that, the ranking is evaluated in accordance with case considered. And in the second stage, MILP is formulated to find the allocations of each spare-part with two distinct approaches through Model-1 and Model-2 separately. Moreover, Model-1 and Model-2 are outlined based on the ranking and efficient parameters-value under cost, limited capacities, quality level and delay lead time respectively. Findings The ranking and their optimal order-allocation of potential suppliers are obtained during consecutive planning periods for both unused and repair spare-parts. Subsequently, sensitivity analysis is conducted to deduce the key nuggets with the comparison of Model-1 and Model-2 in the changing of capacity, demand and cost per spare-parts. From this analysis, it is found that suppliers who have optimal parameter settings would be better for order-allocations than ranking during the changing planning period. Practical implications This paper points out the situation-specific approach for SS problem for a mining industry which often faces disruptive supplying environments. The managerial implication between ranking and parameters are highlighted through Model-1 and Model-2 by sensitivity analysis. Originality/value It provides useful directions for managers who are involved in the procurement of spare-parts in the mining environment. For this, suppliers are selected for order-allocation by using Model-1 and Model-2 in the dynamic business environment. The solvability of the model is presented using LINGO 17. Furthermore, the case company selected in this study can be extended to other sectors.","[Ahmad, Md.

Design/methodology/approach The empirical analysis is based on document analyses, 47 expert interviews and on field observations in Ghana, Africa. Findings Based on an in-depth analysis of a US firm operating a fair trade value chain in an intercultural environment, the authors show that universalistic value chain-oriented governance instruments often fail because of strong institutional and cultural distances. Against the prevailing strategies of top-down management, the authors suggest a more bottom-up, pragmatist and collaboration-based approach to sustainable global value chain governance. Research limitations/implications The results of an in-depth case study are not generalizable. Instead, they provide holistic insights into a so-far insufficiently examined field and an empirical fundament for further research on sustainable governance in global value chains. In particular, research on pragmatist, collaborative, dialogue based, bottom-up approaches of sustainable value chain governance will be of great value to further theoretical development of this field. Practical implications his study is relevant to researchers and practitioners in the field of sustainable value chain governance. It reveals several misunderstandings about the effectiveness and impacts of sustainable governance in less developed countries and thus builds a foundation for better and more effective problem-solving approaches in international sustainable management activities. Social implications Nontransparent supplier networks and ( illegal) sub-contracting, as well as the strong influences of institutional, cultural and sub-cultural factors, make responsible value chain management a challenging task for any firm with international value creation activities. This leaves workers in local factories vulnerable to infringements of their fundamental human rights and the environment unprotected against long-lasting damages. Addressing these challenges and developing new solutions, therefore, can have strong impacts on the lives of workers in international supply chains. Originality/value The authors contribute, first, a differentiated empirical description and analysis of a sustainable value chain approach in a less developed country in Africa. Second, using an example of the field study, the authors highlight limitations of value chain-related governance theory based on a field study by illustrating the challenges and barriers and a lack of existing concepts concerning effective sustainable governance in global value chains. Third, the authors show different managerial responses to these cultural and institutional challenges between universalism and relativism, and, fourth, the authors suggest a more collaborative, bottom-up and pragmatist approach to sustainable value chain governance.","[Knoll, Hedda Ofoole] Univ Hamburg, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Hamburg, Germany; [Jastram, Sarah Margaretha] Hamburg Sch Business Adm, Dept Strategy & Leadership, Hamburg, Germany","Knoll, HO (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Hamburg, Germany.",,,,,,,60,1,1,0,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-5680,1746-5699,,SOC BUS REV,Soc.

On the other hand, minimizing the total cost of the transportation and distribution is one of the critical items for companies. To handle this challenge, this paper aims to present a multi-objective multi-facility model of green closed-loop supply chain (GCLSC) under uncertain environment. In this model, the proposed GCLSC considers three classes in case of the leading chain and three classes in terms of the recursive chain. The objectives are to maximize the total profit of the GCLSC, satisfaction of demand, the satisfactions of the customers and getting to the proper cost of the consumers, distribution centers and recursive centers. Design/methodology/approach Then, this model is designed by considering several products under several periods regarding the recovery possibility of products. Finally, to evaluate the proposed model, several numerical examples are randomly designed and then solved using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm and non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm. Then, they are ranked by TOPSIS along with analytical hierarchy process so-called analytic hierarchy process-technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (AHP-TOPSIS). Findings The results indicated that non-dominated ranked genetic algorithm (NRGA) algorithm outperforms non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) algorithm in terms of computation times. However, in other metrics, any significant difference was not seen. At the end, to rank the algorithms, a multi-criterion decision technique was used. The obtained results of this method indicated that NSGA-II had better performance than ones obtained by NRGA. Originality/value This study is motivated by the need of integrating the leading supply chain and retrogressive supply chain. In short, the highlights of the differences of this research with the mentioned studies are as follows: developing multi-objective multi-facility model of fuzzy GCLSC under uncertain environment and integrating the leading supply chain and retrogressive supply chain.","[Karimi, Behzad; Gavyar, Babak Hassan] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Fac Ind & Mech Engn, Qazvin Branch, Qazvin, Iran; [Niknamfar, Amir Hossein] Islamic Azad Univ, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Qazvin Branch, Qazvin, Iran; [Barzegar, Majid; Mohtashami, Ali] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Ind Management, Qazvin Branch, Qazvin, Iran","Niknamfar, AH (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Qazvin Branch, Qazvin, Iran.",niknamfar@qiau.ac.ir,,"karimi, behzad/0000-0003-1894-5777",,,,39,2,2,4,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0144-5154,1758-4078,,ASSEMBLY AUTOM,Assem.

The objective of the study is to optimize preservation investment, the number of shipments and shipment quantity, so that the total cost per unit of time of the supply chain is minimized. The study proposes a solution method, and the results show that investment in preservation technology reduces the total supply chain cost by 13%. Additionally, preservation increases the lot size, thus increasing the production cycle length, which reduces the ordering cost of the system. Furthermore, this study shows that preservation leads to a reduction of solid waste from deteriorated products. Total deteriorated products reduced to 8 units from 235 units, hence, preservation generates positive environmental benefits along with economic impacts. The robustness of the proposed model is illustrated with a numerical example, sensitivity analysis, and graphical representations.

To improve the productivity and the resilience of national economies, it is important to understand the drivers and the barriers of the internatiolisation of economic activities. While internatiolisation of individual economic actors is difficult to explain using traditional theories, aggregate patterns may be explained to some extent. We take a network-centric perspective to describe the extent of corporate internatiolisation in different countries. Based on Newman's assortativity coefficient, we design a range of assortativity metrics which are appropriate in the firm network context. Using these, we quantify companies' appetite for internatiolisation in relation to the internatiolisation of their partners. We use the Factset Revere dataset, which is provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc., that captures global supply chain relationships between companies. We identify countries where the level of internationalisation is relatively high or relatively low, and we show that subtle differences in the assortativity metrics used change the ranking of countries significantly in terms of the assortativity correlation, highlighting that companies in different countries are prone to different types of internationalisation. Overall, we demonstrate that firms from most countries in the dataset studied have a slight preference to make supply chain relationships with other firms which have undergone a similar level of internationalisation, and other firms from their own country. The implications of our results are important for countries to understand the evolution of international relationships in their corporate environments, and how they compare to other nations in the world in this regard.","[Piraveenan, Mahendra; Matous, Petr] Univ Sydney, Fac Engn & IT, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Senanayake, Upul] Univ New South Wales, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Todo, Yasuyuki] Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1698050, Japan","Piraveenan, M (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Fac Engn & IT, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",mahendrarajah.piraveenan@sydney.edu.au,,"Matous, Petr/0000-0002-6140-6843",,,,29,2,2,0,12,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",1054-1500,1089-7682,,CHAOS,Chaos,FEB,2019,29,2,,,,,,,23124,10.1063/1.5082015,,,14,"Mathematics, Applied; Physics, Mathematical",Mathematics; Physics,HN2RP,WOS:000460032800027,30823710,,,,2021-03-04

Big data analytics (BDA) is becoming increasingly popular among manufacturing companies as it helps gain insights and make decisions based on BD. However, there many barriers to the adoption of BDA in manufacturing supply chains. It is therefore necessary for manufacturing companies to identify and examine the nature of each barrier. Previous studies have mostly built conceptual frameworks for BDA in a given situation and have ignored examining the nature of the barriers to BDA. Due to the significance of both BD and BDA, this research aims to identify and examine the critical barriers to the adoption of BDA in manufacturing supply chains in the context of Bangladesh. This research explores the existing body of knowledge by examining these barriers using a Delphi-based analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Data were obtained from five Bangladeshi manufacturing companies. The findings of this research are as follows: (i) data-related barriers are most important, (ii) technology-related barriers are second, and (iii) the five most important components of these barriers are (a) lack of infrastructure, (b) complexity of data integration, (c) data privacy, (d) lack of availability of BDA tools and (e) high cost of investment. The findings can assist industrial managers to understand the actual nature of the barriers and potential benefits of using BDA and to make policy regarding BDA adoption in manufacturing supply chains. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to justify the robustness of the barrier rankings.","[Moktadir, Md Abdul] Univ Dhaka, Inst Leather Engn & Technol, Dhaka 1209, Bangladesh; [Ali, Syed Mithun] Bangladesh Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Ind & Prod Engn, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh; [Paul, Sanjoy Kumar] Univ Technol Sydney, UTS Business Sch, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Shukla, Nagesh] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Sch Syst Management & Leadership, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia","Paul, SK (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, UTS Business Sch, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",sanjoy.paul@uts.edu.au,"Moktadir, Abdul/J-1881-2019; Shukla, Nagesh/X-6556-2019; Ali, Syed Mithun/AAF-8674-2020; Paul, Sanjoy/K-2618-2019","Moktadir, Abdul/0000-0003-1852-7815; Ali, Syed Mithun/0000-0002-4302-5991; Paul, Sanjoy/0000-0001-9523-179X; Shukla, Nagesh/0000-0002-8421-3972",,,,66,25,26,4,39,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-8352,1879-0550,,COMPUT IND ENG,Comput.

Although researchers maintain that green supply chain management can bring positive financial performance, to date they have ignored the moderating role of the social control mechanism, especially in the context of China. Drawing on social exchange theory, this study aims to contribute to the literature in this field by proposing social control as an effective mechanism to strengthen the impact of green supply chain management on firms' financial performance. Today, most empirical literature in the field of green supply chain management adopts the static view and overlooks the contextual factors. This study addresses the gap by investigating the green supply chain management in an environment characterized by frequently unavoidable disruptions, and the effectiveness of social control that accommodates this complexity and dynamism. By examining green supply chain management under conditions of environmental dynamism, this study contributes to the literature of interface of green supply chain and resilience. Using a sample of 185 Chinese manufacturers, the theoretical model is empirically verified. The research findings indicate that in a dynamic environment, the joint effect of social control and green supply chain management practices is positive and significant. This paper also discusses the theoretical contribution and managerial implications of the study, outlines the research limitations, and provides recommendations for future research.","[Zhang, Minhao; Tse, Ying Kei] Univ York, York Management Sch, York YO10 5GD, N Yorkshire, England; [Dai, Jing] Univ Nottingham China, Nottingham Univ Business Sch China, Dept Entrepreneurship Mkt & Management Syst, Ningbo 315100, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Chan, Hing Kai] Univ Nottingham China, Nottingham Univ Business Sch China, Ningbo 315100, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Tse, YK (corresponding author), Univ York, York Management Sch, York YO10 5GD, N Yorkshire, England.",minhao.zhang@york.ac.uk; mike.tse@york.ac.uk; jing.dai@nottingham.edu.cn; hingkai.chan@nottingham.edu.cn,"Chan, Hing Kai/A-8343-2008; jam, amir/O-6460-2019; Zhang, Minhao/X-8884-2019; Garrido, Alexander/U-4544-2017","Zhang, Minhao/0000-0002-1334-4481; Garrido, Alexander/0000-0003-0551-3254; Tse, Ying Kei (Mike)/0000-0001-6174-0326; Dai, Jing/0000-0003-1715-2409",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71602096],This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71602096.,,97,10,10,14,76,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

The problem with electricity supply chain network design (ESCND) using smart grid has not been broadly explored by researchers. This paper aims to approach this problem using a multiobjective robust optimization method. The three objectives are economic (profit maximization), environmental (greenhouse gas emissions minimization), and resilience (network resilience maximization). Efficiency maximization-power loss minimization-has also been taken into account using its corresponding cost element in the economic objective function. The proposed approach accounts for different unique smart grid components such as demand side management programs, microgrid structure, two-way distribution lines, and supplier-consumer nodes, while incorporating different interrelated decisions including facility location, capacity expansion, load allocation, and pricing. To solve the resultant model, a hybrid multiobjective robust optimization technique is proposed based on cutting plane and AUGMECON2 algorithms. The proposed model and solution approach are then applied to an actual case study and the produced results are thoroughly analyzed. We find that while economic and environmental objectives can be strictly conflicting, the implementation of smart grids can result in concurrent boost in both environmental performance and network resilience.","[Jabbarzadeh, Armin] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Ind Engn, Tehran 1684613114, Iran; [Rastegar, Saeed] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Ind Engn Sch, Tehran 1684613114, Iran; [Fahimnia, Behnam] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Darlington, NSW 2008, Australia","Jabbarzadeh, A (corresponding author), Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Ind Engn, Tehran 1684613114, Iran.",arminj@iust.ac.ir; behnam.fahimnia@sydney.edu.au; saeed_rastegar@ind.iust.ac.ir,"Garrido, Alexander/U-4544-2017; jam, amir/O-6460-2019","Garrido, Alexander/0000-0003-0551-3254; Fahimnia, Behnam/0000-0002-8974-9928",,,,68,6,6,7,51,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

The primary reasons for this growing attention mainly down to the governments-driven and environmental related regulations which has caused the overall supply cost to reduce while enhancing the customer satisfaction. Thereby, in the present study, efforts have been made to propose a facility location/allocation model for a multi-echelon multi-product multi-period CLSC network under shortage, uncertainty, and discount on the purchase of raw materials. To design the network, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model capable of reducing total costs of network is proposed. Moreover, the model is developed using a robust fuzzy programming (RFP) to investigate the effects of uncertainty parameters including customer demand, fraction of returned products, transportation costs, the price of raw materials, and shortage costs. As the developed model was NP-hard, a novel whale optimization algorithm (WOA) aimed at minimizing the network total costs with application of a modified priority-based encoding procedure is proposed. To validate the model and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, some quantitative experiments were designed and solved by an optimization solver package and the proposed algorithm. Comparison of the outcomes provided by the proposed algorithm and exact solution is indicative of high quality performance of the applied algorithm to find a near-optimal solution within the reasonable computational time.

In line with previous research, we identified and updated 13 key SC capabilities out of 24 as core performance measures of supply network resilience. Furthermore, our findings categorised each capability and element into one of four types of influential power variables (drivers, dependent, autonomous, or linkage). This study (i) lends support to and updates previous research that examined the core capabilities of SCRES and (ii) provides complementary classifications for the influential powers of SCRES capabilities and elements. The literature indicates that there has been no research that has integrated SLR as a basis to ISM for an effective way to utilize existing studies for increasing awareness and developing managerial guidelines to achieve SCRES.","[Shin, Nina] Sejong Univ, Coll Business Adm, Seoul 05006, South Korea; [Park, Sangwook] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Seoul 08826, South Korea","Park, S (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",ninashin@sejong.ac.kr; sangpark@snu.ac.kr,"Shin, Nina/S-9896-2019",,Institute of Management Research at Seoul National University,The authors thank the Institute of Management Research at Seoul National University for supporting this research.,,125,1,1,5,25,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN 2,2019,11,2,,,,,,,484,10.3390/su11020484,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HJ4FR,WOS:000457129900188,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04
J,"Lin, CF",,,,"Lin, Ching-Fu",,,"Blockchainizing Food Law: Promises and Perils of Incorporating Distributed Ledger Technologies to Food Safety, Traceability, and Sustainability Governance",FOOD AND DRUG LAW JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FUTURE CHALLENGES; FRAMEWORK; SECURITY; STRATEGY; FDA,"Blockchain refers to distributed ledger technologies that can store, maintain, and update data collaboratively along a network of computing nodes. With the help of cryptography, peer-to-peer networks, and consensus mechanisms, data input to the blockchain is simultaneously and permanently recorded and updated in all the nodes of the network, ensuring a high level of consistency and authenticity of such data. Given such technological advantages, blockchain's potential to revolutionize the global food supply chain seems salient: transforming paper-based documents into a blockchain-enabled identity to generate a high level of transparency and data integrity, enabling smaller farmers to bypass middlemen in crops trading and cash transfers and providing an efficient and cost-effective way to manage the production system. In 2017, IBM announced a collaboration with a few major food producers and retailers, including, inter alia, Dole, Nestle, Tyson Foods, Kroger, Unilever, and Walmart, to leverage disruptive technologies such as blockchain to enhance quality control, food safety, management, and traceability. Similarly, the United Nations World Food Program launched the Building Block program in 2017, which uses iris-scanning technologies and blockchains to help Syrian refugees verify their identities and directly receive aid without intermediaries. Despite such promising development, blockchain is not a silver bullet to solve all food governance issues. Rather, there may be some new challenges that need to be adequately addressed. As argued by this Article, blockchainizing governance of food safety, traceability, and sustainability may pose another layer of regulatory questions about technical capacity and infrastructure gap, scalability and implementation costs, global standardization politics, cybersecurity and data protection, and technologically inherent limits of blockchain. In addition, policy challenges to both developed and developing countries (albeit in different ways) in terms of operational expertise and technical infrastructure, scalability and implementation costs, and power asymmetry in international standard-setting cannot be ignored. More generally, this Article argues that such regulatory questions may call for a reconceptualization of the forms and substances of conventional food law and policy as well as data protection law, anti-trust law, and trade law. In this light, this Article calls for a more technologically informed policy-making process before rushing into the hype of blockchainizing food law.","[Lin, Ching-Fu] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Inst Law Sci & Technol, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Lin, CF (corresponding author), Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Inst Law Sci & Technol, Hsinchu, Taiwan.",,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [109-2636-H-007-001]","This research is partly funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (109-2636-H-007-001).

A dynamic optimization mathematical model is developed to find the optimal supply scheme in each period with the objective of minimum total costs. In the dynamic optimization model, the parameters are changed with time. An improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to solve this dynamic problem. In the proposed algorithm, a change detector and a change response strategy are used to handle the change of optimization environment. We also adopt a self-adaption neighborhood search strategy to improve the ability of exploration and exploitation of the algorithm. Numerical experiment shows that the proposed strategy can improve the performance of algorithm greatly, and the model and solution method in this paper can be applied to optimize the spare parts supply in various scenarios.","[Wang, Yadong; Shi, Quan] Univ PLA, Army Engn, Dept Equipment Command & Management, Shijiazhuang 050003, Hebei, Peoples R China","Shi, Q (corresponding author), Univ PLA, Army Engn, Dept Equipment Command & Management, Shijiazhuang 050003, Hebei, Peoples R China.",xwzj0003@gmail.com,,"WANG, YADONG/0000-0003-1551-1826",,,,43,1,1,0,0,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2019,7,,,,,,153694,153709,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948859,,,16,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,KG9CK,WOS:000510248200001,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

Improvements to the efficiency of existing technologies or practices appear insufficient for achieving sustainable development within the planetary boundaries. Disruptive, systemic and transformational changes appear necessary in order to replace existing technologies and practices to establish a sustainable economy. Such innovations often start out in niches; however, the scaling up and the ultimate replacement of current socio-technical systems requires governance to allow for the coordination of actors, the reorganization of socio-technical systems and the mobilization and allocation of resources. As governmental institutions are part of the current (non-sustainable) systems and thereby fail to provide coherent, integrated and transformative governance, we explore whether institutional innovation from non-state actors can step in to provide governance of transformation processes. Based on explorative qualitative case studies of networks in the food sector, city planning and reporting tools, we analyze the potential of bottom-up institutional innovations to coordinate actors in transformation processes.","[Jacob, Klaus] Free Univ Berlin, Environm Policy Res Ctr FFU, Ihnestr 22, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Jacob, Klaus; Guske, Anna-Lena] Free Univ Berlin, Environm Policy Res Ctr, Berlin, Germany; [Antoni-Komar, Irene] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Chair Business Adm, Oldenburg, Germany; [Funcke, Simon] Forschungszentrum Julich, Project Management Org Energy, Technol, Sustainabil ETN, Julich, Germany; [Gruchmann, Tim] West Coast Univ Appl Sci, Chair Logist & Supply Chain Management, Heide, Germany; [Kny, Josefa; Stumpf, Klara Helene] Europa Univ Flensburg, Norbert Elias Ctr Transformat Design & Res, Flensburg, Germany; [Naber, Elias; Volk, Rebekka] KIT, IIP, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Ruppert-Winkel, Chantal] Univ Freiburg, Chair Environm Governance, Freiburg, Germany; [Sauer, Philipp Christopher] Univ Kassel, Chair Supply Chain Management, Kassel, Germany","Jacob, K (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Environm Policy Res Ctr FFU, Ihnestr 22, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",klaus.jacob@fu-berlin.de,"Jacob, Klaus/ABD-9583-2020; Sauer, Philipp C./P-8327-2019; Jacob, Klaus/AAB-9109-2020","Sauer, Philipp C./0000-0002-1823-0723; Jacob, Klaus/0000-0003-3420-1508",German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF); BMBFFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [FKZ 01UT1501C]; SOEF [FKZ 01UT1501C],We thank the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) for making this article possible.

Supply chain network design as the most important strategic decision in supply chain management, plays an important role in overall environmental and economic performance of the supply chain. The nature and complexity of today's supply chains network make them vulnerable to various risks. One of the most important risks is disruption risk. Disruptions are costly and can be caused by internal or external sources to the supply chain, thus it is crucial that managers take appropriate measures of response to reduce its negative effects. Recovery time of disrupted facilities and return it to normal condition can be an important factor for member of the supply chain. In this paper, a bi-objective model is developed for reliable supply chain network design under facility disruption. To solve this model, we have applied two approaches, i.e., epsilon constraint method as an exact method and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGAII) as a meta-heuristic method.","[Hatefi, Seyed Morteza] Shahrekord Univ, Fac Engn, Rahbar Blvd,POB 115, Shahrekord, Iran; [Moshashaee, Seyed Mohtasham; Mahdavi, Iraj] Mazandaran Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Babol Sar, Iran","Hatefi, SM (corresponding author), Shahrekord Univ, Fac Engn, Rahbar Blvd,POB 115, Shahrekord, Iran.",smhatefi@alumni.ut.ac.ir,,,Shahrekord University;  [97GRN1M1759],This work has been financially supported by the research deputy of Shahrekord University.

To improve the performance of a supply chain network, it is essential to build a strategic and a strong relationships. As such, all firms should select the best suppliers by applying appropriate methods through different selection criteria. An appropriate supplier reduces all purchasing costs as well as increases customer satisfaction to improve the final product and strengthen corporate competitiveness. Due to the natural uncertainty of this dilemma, most of recent works show a great deal of interest in applying uncertainty approaches. The main innovation of this paper is to develop a new multi-objective model for both supplier selection and order allocation operations considering incremental discount in a fuzzy environment. The proposed model considers the material cost with incremental discount and the transportation cost, holding costs along with its control and interest as well as the possibility of payment, brought back, and replacement costs, simultaneously, for the first time in this research area. Based on the proposed fuzzy model, the Zimmermann fuzzy approach is used in order to covert the model in a single objective form. Accordingly, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied to solve the proposed problem. Based on the multi-objective optimization proposed, a Non-dominated Sorting GA (NSGA-II) is also employed to solve the developed model through the multi-objective assessment methodologies.

Notwithstanding, supply chain managers lagged behind this target overlooking green development in considering environmental impact which has become a main criterion in supply chain management. Where the era of greenness threatens current supply chain partners with the need to either cope with the new green regulations or leave the field for new players. Thus, an approach to design supply chains that are simultaneously resilient, and green is needed. This study satisfies this need by developing a green and resilient (G-resilient, here after) fuzzy multi-objective programming model (GR-FMOPM) to present a G-resilient supply chain network design in determining the optimal number of facilities that should be established. The objectives are minimization of total cost and environmental impact and maximization of Value of resilience pillars where robustness, Agility, Leanness and Flexibility (V-RALF) can be seen four of main pillars required for supply chain resilience. Fuzzy AHP is used for determining the importance weight for each pillar followed by a usage of a Fuzzy technique for assigning the importance weight for each potential facility with respect to RALF. The importance weights obtained by Fuzzy AHP and the Fuzzy technique are then integrated in the third objective (maximization of V-RALF) to maximize the value of resilience pillars. Based on the fuzzy multi-objective model, the e-constraint method is used to reveal Pareto optimal solutions and TOPSIS was then used to select the final Pareto solution. A case study is used to validate the applicability of the developed GR-FMOPM in obtaining a G-resilient supply chain network design and a trade-off among economic, green and resilience objectives. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed on the importance weight for facilities Pareto solutions with respect to the importance weight of RALF. Research findings proved that the developed GR-FMOPM could be used as a tool in evaluating and ranking related facilities with respect to their resilience performance. It can also be used to obtain a G-resilient supply chain network design in terms of facilities that should be established towards a trade-off among the three aforementioned objectives.","[Mohammed, Ahmed; Harris, I.; Soroka, A.] Cardiff Univ, Business Sch, Aberconway Bldg,Colum Dr, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales; [Mohammed, Ahmed] Directorate Telecommun, Mosul, Iraq; [Nujoom, R.] Univ Portsmouth, Sch Engn, Portsmouth PO1 3DJ, Hants, England","Mohammed, A (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Business Sch, Aberconway Bldg,Colum Dr, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales.",amm.alhamdany@gmail.com,"jam, amir/O-6460-2019; Mohammed, Ahmed/U-3258-2019",,European Regional Development Fund through the Welsh Government,The authors acknowledge the financial support from the European Regional Development Fund through the Welsh Government for ASTUTE 2020 (Advanced Sustainable Manufacturing Technologies) to facilitate this work.

As water plays an important role in people's life and business environment, the problem of water allocation should be considered carefully to properly satisfy demand of water consumers. In the real world applications, problems like water allocation are uncertain owing to long-term planning horizon of such problems. Therefore, employing efficient methods for tackling uncertainty of parameters should be regarded by field researchers. In this regard, this paper proposes a bi-objective mathematical programming model for water distribution network design. The extended model maximizes total profit of water distribution as well as maximizing priority of water transferring among water customer zones. Then, to cope effectively with uncertainty of parameters, a novel robust possibilistic programming method is applied. Then, fuzzy and robust fuzzy programming models are compared against each other and output results confirm superiority and effective performance of the robust fuzzy model in the water allocation problem. Also, output results of the extended model show its accurate performance that results in applicability of the model as a strong planning tool in real world cases.","[Fazli-Khalaf, Mohamadreza; Fathollahzadeh, Karo; Mollaei, Amir; Naderi, Bahman; Mohammadi, Mohammad] Kharazmi Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Fac Engn, Tehran, Iran","Naderi, B (corresponding author), Kharazmi Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Fac Engn, Tehran, Iran.",bahman.naderi@khu.ac.ir,"mohammadi, mohammad/AAB-2718-2020","Mohammadi, Mohammad/0000-0002-3655-2742",,,,49,2,2,0,2,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",0399-0559,1290-3868,,RAIRO-OPER RES,Rairo-Oper.

However, in general, most of the studies on facility location problems assume that the facilities, once built, will always run availably and reliably. In fact, although the probability is very low, supply chain disruptions often incur disastrous consequences. Therefore, it is critical to account for disruptions during designing supply chain networks. To accomplish planned outcomes and greater supply chain resiliency, this article proposes a continuous approximation approach based on regular hexagon partition to address the reliable facility location problems with consideration of facility disruptions risk. The optimization goal is to determine the best facility location that minimizes the expected total system cost on the premise that the supply chain network is not disrupted as a whole when one or some facilities are subject to probabilistic failure. Our numerical experiment discusses the performance of the proposed solution approaches which demonstrates that the benefits of considering disruptions in the supply chain design can be significant. In addition, considering the impact of disruption probability estimation error on the optimal decision, the misestimating of the disruption probability is also investigated in this paper.","[Wang, Jiguang; Wu, Yucai] Shanxi Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Taiyuan 030006, Shanxi, Peoples R China","Wang, JG (corresponding author), Shanxi Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Taiyuan 030006, Shanxi, Peoples R China.",wangjg@sxu.edu.cn,,"Wang, Jiguang/0000-0002-0724-7300; Wu, Yucai/0000-0001-5997-5310",MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [16YJC630116],This work was supported by the MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (Project no. 16YJC630116).,,40,0,0,0,4,WILEY-HINDAWI,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",1076-2787,1099-0526,,COMPLEXITY,Complexity,,2019,,,,,,,,,5280161,10.1155/2019/5280161,,,12,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Multidisciplinary Sciences",Mathematics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,HM7PB,WOS:000459670200001,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

This paper deals with the prioritization of critical sustainability criteria and the sustainability strategy selection (SSS) using an integrated weighting approach. This approach consists of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), the subjective and objective weight integrated approach (SOWIA) and the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) and is found to be effective for solving this multi-criteria decision-making problem. The proposed methodology is applied to solve a real-time supply chain decision-making issue of an Indian manufacturing industry. From a sustainability perspective, the results indicate the second strategy set as the best among the given alternatives, with an objective factor of 0.5. The robustness of the results has been analysed to identify the uncertainty in the final ranking. The consistency of the final ranking has been evaluated based on different objective factor values. The novelty of this paper pertains to addressing the most relevant SSS problem involved in a manufacturing supply chain and in establishing a hybrid approach for solving it. This approach offers a flexible provision for decision-makers to incorporate the appropriate level of subjectivity and objectivity into their decisions based on their degree of expertise.

We develop a generalized Benders decomposition-based approach to solve the models. Problems representing a variety of scenarios that simulates different economic environments are solved. Our computational results show that the product costing method could influence the concentration of production activities at potential manufacturing locations, production and shipment quantities, product prices, and allocation of profits in the supply chain.","[de Matta, Renato] Univ Iowa, Dept Management Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","de Matta, R (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Dept Management Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",renato-dematta@uiowa.edu,,,Lary and Lori Wright Research Fellowship,I would like to thank Tan Miller for his insights and also for the industry data without which this study would not have been possible.

Recent studies have indicated that changes and disruptions within such networks can serve as indicators for increased risks of violence and armed conflicts. This is especially true of countries that may not be able to compete for scarce commodities during supply shocks. Thus, network-induced vulnerability to supply disruption is typically exported from wealthier populations to disadvantaged populations. As such, researchers and stakeholders concerned with supply chains, political science, environmental studies, etc. need tools to explore the complex dynamics within global trade networks and how the structure of these networks relates to regional instability. However, the multivariate, spatiotemporal nature of the network structure creates a bottleneck in the extraction and analysis of correlations and anomalies for exploratory data analysis and hypothesis generation. Working closely with experts in political science and sustainability, we have developed a highly coordinated, multi-view framework that utilizes anomaly detection, network analytics, and spatiotemporal visualization methods for exploring the relationship between global trade networks and regional instability. Requirements for analysis and initial research questions to be investigated are elicited from domain experts, and a variety of visual encoding techniques for rapid assessment of analysis and correlations between trade goods, network patterns, and time series signatures are explored. We demonstrate the application of our framework through case studies focusing on armed conflicts in Africa. regional instability measures, and their relationship to international global trade.","[Wang, Hong; Lu, Yafeng; Shutters, Shade T.; Steptoe, Michael; Maciejewski, Ross] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Landis, Steven] Univ Nevada, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Wang, Feng] GE Global Res, Niskayuna, NY USA","Wang, H (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",hxwang@asu.edu; lyafgeng@asu.edu; Shade.Shutters@asu.edu; msteptoe@asu.edu; Feng.Wang1@ge.com; steven.landis@unlv.edu; rmacieje@asu.edu,,,"U.S. Department of Homeland SecurityUnited States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) [2017-ST-061-QA0001]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1350573, 1630227]","This work is supported by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under Award Number. 2017-ST-061-QA0001 and the National Science Foundation, Grant Nos. 1350573 and 1630227.

Supply Chain Complexity (SCC) is one of the most difficult problems in today's global supply chains and assumed as the key impediment to business performance. SCC has the significant adverse impact on competitiveness, cost efficiency, customer satisfaction, product innovation and market share. It is imperative for the focal firm and its supply chain managers to know SCC drivers causing supply chain complexity. Identification and prioritizing of SCC drivers are required for effective monitoring and controlling of supply chain management. SCC drivers can be categorized based on the origin of their generation as upstream, operational, downstream and external. This paper presents the study conducted in leading earthmoving and mining equipment manufacturing firms in India, to understand the supply chain complexities for off-road & mining equipment industries. Qualitative situation-actors-process (SAP) and learning-action-performance (LAP) model has been applied to understand and analyze the concept of supply chain complexity drivers and its dynamic behavior. Quantitatively multi-criterion decision making (MCDM) is used in prioritizing SCC drivers due to the subjectivity of drivers. An AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) study has also been done to quantify and prioritize SCC drivers for managerial decision making. This study contributes towards developing a priority ranking of SCC drivers based on its impact on overall SCC which have significant importance in supply chain strategic planning. The current research investigates evolving SCC drivers like supplier resourcing risk, supplier competence, regional strategies, shortening product life-cycle, changing customer service expectation which were not adequately addressed in existing literature. Our research findings provides practical insights to managers in understanding the role of SCC drivers like market uncertainty and risk, changing laws and regulations, constant change in customer requirement, multiplicity of customers, forecast inaccuracy, sustainable supply chain practices in the overall outcome of ranking. The outcome of this study also enriches the existing literature of SCC with practitioners' insight from manufacturing industry.","[Chand, Pushpendu; Ghosh, Kunal Kanti] Indian Inst Technol IIT Kharagpur, Vinod Gupta Sch Management, Kharagpur, W Bengal, India; [Thakkar, Jitesh J.] Indian Inst Technol IIT Kharagpur, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Kharagpur, W Bengal, India","Chand, P (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol IIT Kharagpur, Vinod Gupta Sch Management, Kharagpur, W Bengal, India.",pushpendu.chand@gmail.com; jt@iem.iitkgp.ernet.in; kunal@vgsom.iitkgp.ernet.in,"Thakkar, Jitesh/AAD-6089-2019","Thakkar, Jitesh/0000-0001-6415-1981",,,,72,9,10,1,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4207,1873-7641,,RESOUR POLICY,Resour.

In parallel, food scholars have actively investigated the contribution of alternative food networks (AFNs) to the development of more sustainable and just food systems, paying attention to drivers, initiatives and policies supporting the development of alternatives to the dominant industrialised food system and its detrimental environmental and socio-economic impacts. However, few studies have directly addressed the contribution of AFNs to food security in the Global North. This paper aims to establish new linkages between food security debates and critical AFNs literature. For that purpose, we conduct a place-based approach to food security in a comparative analysis of initiatives of three different European contexts: Cardiff city-region (UK), the Flemish Region (Belgium) and the peri-urban area of the city of Valencia (Spain). The results unfold: i) how AFNs weave a more localised socio-economic fabric that creates new relationships between food security outcomes and specific territories, ii) hybridization processes within alternative but also conventional systems and iii) the role of advocacy and collective action at different levels. The analysis allows identification of key elements on which food security debates hinge and provides new insights to ground conceptual discussions on territorial and place-based food security approaches.","[Cerrada-Serra, Pedro; Ortiz-Miranda, Dionisio] Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Camino Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Moragues-Faus, Ana; Adlerova, Barbora] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch Geog & Planning, Sustainable Pl Inst, 33 Pk Pl, Cardiff CF10 3BA, S Glam, Wales; [Zwart, Tjitske Anna; Avermaete, Tessa] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, SFERE, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium","Cerrada-Serra, P (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Camino Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain.",pedcerse@esp.upv.es; MoraguesFausA1@cardiff.ac.uk; dortiz@esp.upv.es,"Ortiz-Miranda, Dionisio/D-3839-2011; Moragues-Faus, Ana/AAB-6812-2021","Ortiz-Miranda, Dionisio/0000-0002-6884-8927; Moragues-Faus, Ana/0000-0001-7926-6394",EUEuropean Commission [613532]; European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre; Welsh Government,"This research is part of the project Assessment of the impact of global drivers of change on Europe's food security (TRANSMANGO), granted by the EU under 7th Framework Programme; theme KBBE.2013.2.5-01; Grant agreement no: 613532.

This study identified the critical adoption factors from literature review and categorized them into technological, organizational and environmental dimensions. Data was collected from 234 industrial managers who were involved in the decision-making process regarding IT procurement in Malaysian manufacturing companies. Research results showed that technological factors (perceived benefits, complexity, technology resources, big data quality and integration) have the highest influence on the big data adoption and firms' performance. This study is one of the pioneers in using DEMATEL-ANFIS approach in the big data adoption context.

Thus, buyer and supplier firms are urged to comply with CSR codes in a coordinated manner. In other words, multinational buyers are expected to extend CSR practices to their suppliers in emerging countries. This is particularly crucial when suppliers' CSR performance is screened under a regulatory agency's inspection regime. To this end, this study formulates an analytical model to understand the effects of buying firms' supportive schemes, i.e., technical assistance programmes, on their partner suppliers' CSR performance. Specifically, we develop a multi-period behavioural model to simulate a system consisting of multiple buyers and suppliers where the government regularly conducts inspections on suppliers' CSR performance. The results from the agent-based simulation analysis shed light on (1) how the dyadic risk preferences of suppliers and buyers affect suppliers' CSR performance; (2) how the gap between the perceived and actual CSR levels in a supplier interacts with the regulatory agency's tactics to influence suppliers' CSR performance; (3) the extent to which the overall suppliers' CSR performance improvement is attributable to the buyers' technical assistance programmes under the regulatory agency's inspection regime. This research contributes to the socially responsible supply chain management literature and provides innovative managerial insights for policy makers (e.g., CSR regulators) to promote CSR practices among suppliers.","[Tong, Xun] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Nettelbosje 2, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands; [Chen, Jianghang] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sino US Global Logist Inst, 1954 Huashan Rd, Shanghai 20030, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Qinghua] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, 1954 Huashan Rd, Shanghai 20030, Peoples R China; [Cheng, T.

In recent years, overdependence on deeper and wider multinational supply and production chains and lean-optimization has led to tightly integrated systems with little slack and high sensitivity to disruptions. This study considers the impact of Emission Control Areas and establishes a link between environmental and network resilience performance for maritime supply chains using operational cost and SOx emissions cost metrics. The proposed methodological framework analyzes various abatement options, disruption intensities, fuel pricing instances and regulatory strategies. The methodology utilizes a minimum cost flow assignment and an arc velocity optimization model for vessel speed to establish the payoff for various network states. Additionally, an attacker defender game is set up to identify optimal regulatory strategies under various disruption scenarios. The results are complemented by a sensitivity analysis on SOx emissions pricing, to better equip policy makers to manage environmental and resilience legislation. The methodology and findings provide a comprehensive analytic approach to optimize maritime supply chain performance beyond minimisation of operational costs, to also minimize exposure to costly supply chain disruptions.","[Zavitsas, Konstantinos] Imperial Coll London, London, England; [Zis, Thalis] Tech Univ Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark; [Bell, Michael G.

It is also essential for firms' purchasing structure to fit the purchasing strategy whether it is cost reduction; value analysis and/or improving delivery and increasing flexibility for achieving superior purchasing performance. The purpose of this paper is to scientifically examine the influence of organization culture (OC), green supplier development (GSD), supplier relationship management, flexibility and innovation on sustainability in supply network (SSN) under the moderation effect of institutional pressures and resources availability. Design/methodology/approach The study is grounded by integrating institutional theory (IT) and resource-based view (RBV) theory. The study empirically tests the conceptual model through survey data gathered from 175 respondents in the KwaZulu-Natal province of Southern Africa using structural equation modeling which is a multivariate data analysis technique that permits to simultaneously examine many relationships among manifest and latent variables. Findings It was found that OC plays a crucial role in shaping the workforce behavior and responsible for enhancing GSDs and building good relationship with suppliers which ultimately results into increased flexibility and innovativeness. Coercive pressures (CPs) play a moderating role between the causal relationship of innovation and SSN. Therefore, CPs have got the ability to amplify or reverse the effect between innovation and SSNs. Research limitations/implications The study suffers from few limitations. First, the study is restricted to one particular province in South Africa. Second, cross-sectional data were used for testing of model in the research study. Practical implications The findings are of great importance for both the researchers and supply chain practitioners. Supply chain practitioners may use this knowledge for benchmarking the supply network configuration process and continuously improve the process. The tested model actually shows the mechanism for enhancing SSNs. In today's dynamic and uncertain business environment, all firms in the supply network aims to minimize risks and maximize profitability. The findings show that CPs play a moderating effect on the relationship between innovation and SSN. Whenever government authorities and institutions pressurize firms for minimizing pollution levels, we see a trend of increased innovations in the form of new product developments, usage of eco-friendly raw material and application of eco-friendly technology which ultimately minimizes the carbon footprint. Through such initiatives steel and engineering firms conform to the government norms and regulations. However, innovations are possible through collaboration with specialist suppliers and sub-suppliers by adopting a common standard across the supply network. Through this overall process of innovation, the focal firm and sub-suppliers linked in the network will benefit and ultimately achieve a competitive edge. Therefore, firms can experience multiple benefits in terms of lower development costs, lower project cycle completion time, improvement in design for re-manufacturability, low downtime, low supply risks, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and, ultimately, sustainable development. Originality/value The study is unique from dual perspective - both in terms of scope and contribution to supply chain management literature. First, the study integrates flexibility and innovation to study the impact on SSNs. Second, it integrates both IT and RBV theory of firm to test the moderation effect and the findings further opens up window for future research.","[Bag, Surajit; Telukdarie, Arnesh] Univ Johannesburg, Postgrad Sch Engn Management, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Gupta, Shivam] Sambalpur Univ Campus, Indian Inst Management Sambalpur, Burla, India","Bag, S (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Postgrad Sch Engn Management, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Johannesburg, South Africa.",surajit.bag@gmail.com,"jam, amir/O-6460-2019; Gupta, Shivam/R-2996-2016; Bag, Surajit/AAF-4874-2020","Gupta, Shivam/0000-0002-2714-4958; BAG, SURAJIT/0000-0002-2344-9551",,,,158,11,11,3,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-5771,1758-4094,,BENCHMARKING,Benchmarking,NOV 29,2018,25,9,,,,,3951,3985,,10.1108/BIJ-06-2017-0132,,,35,Management,Business & Economics,HD4RY,WOS:000452516900028,,,,,2021-03-04

Global cocoa supply chains are under continuous media and public scrutiny. Recent incidents of malpractice in supply chain management have left global chocolatiers vulnerable in terms of how they deal with social issues across their global supply chain networks. Critics have argued that there is a lack of consistency and transparency between what companies say and do in upholding sustainable practices across their supply chains. Design/methodology/approach The authors draw from the sustainable supply chain literature to develop our theoretical parameters and undertake a case-based analysis of the existing sustainability practices of these chocolatiers. Using the insights from this analysis, the authors propose a conceptual framework for a rigorous comparative assessment of self-declared sustainable sourcing initiatives of global agricultural supply chains. The methodology is qualitative and the research method is a secondary-data case study. Findings Four main parameters were identified and used to compare self-declared initiatives, namely: social sustainability certification from respectable bodies; code of conduct for suppliers; partnerships with the primary supply chain stakeholders; and supplier collaboration programme and improvement initiatives. The case companies chosen have implemented several initiatives, but the most prominent seem to indicate the reliance on third-party certification. Not all companies adopted a supplier code of conduct. The partnerships and collaboration programmes with different associations are presented as efficient for companies as well as farmers. Improvements in the conditions of farmers are advocated as a key result. Research limitations/implications This paper is based on self-declared secondary data. Subsequently, it is possible that the case companies did not document some practices; or that companies do not do what they claim. Practical implications This paper provides a comprehensive framework for agricultural businesses to compare their sustainability efforts and improve the performance of their supply chains, particularly those who belong to the cocoa supply chains. The proposed framework allows an assessment of initiatives at policy, strategic, tactical and operational levels to improve social sustainability of supply chains. Social implications This paper may help companies to think more clearly about greater transparency and provide the impetus for dealing more effectively with serious social issues in agricultural supply chains such as: child labour, child trafficking, modern slavery, etc. It may also instruct consumers to better understand what companies do as part of their sustainability agenda, alongside the communication of other features of their products, such as quality. Originality/value The framework adds value by providing a novel way to systematically compile and analyse data around self-declared sustainable initiatives. Actors within agricultural supply chains can use the framework to assess and drive their sustainability efforts and practices, leading to ways to improve the social performance of their global supply chains.","[Lalwani, Sumit Kishore; Nunes, Breno] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Chicksand, Daniel; Boojihawon, Dev Kumar (Roshan)] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England","Nunes, B (corresponding author), Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",b.nunes@aston.ac.uk; D.K.Boojihawon@bham.ac.uk,,"Boojihawon, Dev Kumar/0000-0003-0117-5657; Nunes, Breno/0000-0001-8892-2728",,,,79,5,5,3,34,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-5771,1758-4094,,BENCHMARKING,Benchmarking,NOV 29,2018,25,9,,,,,3986,4008,,10.1108/BIJ-07-2017-0186,,,23,Management,Business & Economics,HD4RY,WOS:000452516900029,,,,,2021-03-04

Companies have been aware of the need to adopt resilience strategies in supply chain management. Therefore, considering resilience factors in the process of assessing and classifying suppliers (ordinal classification or sorting) is relevant. Supplier classification for further selection is a multiple criteria decision problem, which involves several criteria. In this paper, we adopt the ELECTRE TRI-nC method, which allows us to classify the suppliers taking into account multiple criteria and the decision makers' preferences, including resilience criteria. The method was applied to classify the suppliers of a manufacturing industry from an emerging economy (India). A sorting model was collaboratively constructed through an interaction process between the analysts and the decision makers (industrial managers). The proposed approach contributes to the decision process of selecting suppliers by providing a pre-classification of a set of suppliers into three different categories of overall performance. The results show that the proposed method is suitable and useful as a decision aiding tool for purchasing decisions, allowing managers to obtain robust conclusions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we use a multi-method approach to explore 1) the nature of suppliers' CSR heterogeneity based on the various components of CSR in emerging countries, and 2) the choices of MNEs for extending CSR to different types of suppliers in dynamic environments. We begin with a survey of Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) servicing MNEs to examine how these suppliers vary in CSR implementation based on cluster analysis results. To understand the choices made by MNE buyers for extending CSR to their OEM suppliers, we conduct an agent-based simulation study considering the dynamics of a system with multiple agents (i.e., MNE buyers, OEM suppliers, and the government). The cluster analysis results show that CSR practices implemented by Chinese OEMs differ significantly from one another and can be classified into three clusters (i.e., Leader, Follower, and Laggard). The simulation results provide insights into how the adaption costs (e.g., upgrade cost and cost saved by downgrading) and punitive (inspection with possible penalties) and supportive (subsidies) tactics adopted by the government affect the choices made by MNE buyers for extending CSR practices to suppliers in emerging countries. Moreover, we demonstrate when supportive tactics are more effective than punitive tactics under varying conditions and extend the model to investigate the consequences of switching between these two types of tactics in a sequential simulation.","[Tong, Xun] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Nettelbosje 2, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands; [Lai, Kee-hung; Cheng, T.

Global environmental issues have attracted increasing public attention in recent years. As one of the most important industries in Taiwan, the automotive industry needs to implement green supply chain management to comply with current trends, and the selection of suppliers of green parts is particularly important in this regard. Supplier selection is a classic case of multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM). A traditional method, called the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)-based analytical network process (ANP) (DANP), is appropriate to solve the problem of supplier selection. This study proposes a novel variant of DANP, called grey DANP, to effectively reduce the huge problem arising from pairwise comparisons. An empirical study was used to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed grey DANP. It contributes to finding the key factors of selecting green suppliers for Taiwan's automotive industry, including technology, delivery time, environmental management system and pollution control. The cause-effect relationships among key factors indicate that the environmental management system should be given more attention by manufacturers in the selection of green suppliers.","[Jiang, Peng] Dalian Ocean Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yi-Chung] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Management, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yi-Chung] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Tourism, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yi-Chung; Yen, Ghi-Feng; Tsao, Shu-Ju] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Business Adm, 200 Chung Pei Rd, Taoyuan 32023, Taiwan","Hu, YC (corresponding author), Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Business Adm, 200 Chung Pei Rd, Taoyuan 32023, Taiwan.",ychu@cycu.edu.tw,"Jiang, Peng/AAK-8922-2020; jam, amir/O-6460-2019","Jiang, Peng/0000-0003-4876-693X; Hu, Yi-Chung/0000-0003-3090-1515","Research project of China Logistics Society [2018CSLKT3-200]; Ministry of Science and Technology of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST104-2410-H-033-023-MY2]","Research project of China Logistics Society, Grant/Award Number: 2018CSLKT3-200; the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan, Grant/Award Number: MOST104-2410-H-033-023-MY2",,73,13,13,2,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0968-0802,1099-1719,,SUSTAIN DEV,Sustain.

This paper proposed the defuzzification process for gamma type-2 fuzzy variable using critical value (CV) and nearest interval approximation method. A chance constraint programming problem is generated using the CV based reduction method to convert the fuzzy problem to its equivalent crisp form. Applying the a-cut based interval approximation method, a deterministic problem is developed. Some real life data are used to minimize the cost and carbon emission. LINGO standard optimization solver has been used to solve the multi-objective problem using weighted sum method and intuitionistic fuzzy programming technique. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm are implemented to generate efficient optimal solution by converting the multi-objective problem to a single objective problem using penalty cost for carbon emission. After solving the problem, analysis on some particular cases has been presented. The sensitivity analysis has been shown to different credibility levels of cost, emission, source, demand, conveyance to find total cost, emission and transported amount in each level. A comparison study on the performance of three algorithms (LINGO, GA and PSO) is presented. At the end, some graphs have been plotted which shows the effect of emission with different emission parameters.","[Sengupta, Dipanjana] Natl Inst Technol Agartala, Sch Management, Jirania 799046, West Tripura, India; [Das, Amrit; Bera, Uttam Kumar] Natl Inst Technol Agartala, Dept Math, Jirania 799046, West Tripura, India","Bera, UK (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol Agartala, Dept Math, Jirania 799046, West Tripura, India.",dipanjanasengupta09@gmail.com; das.amrit12@gmail.com; bera_uttam@yahoo.co.in,,"BERA, UTTAM/0000-0001-5426-7614","Department of Science and Technology, New DelhiDepartment of Science & Technology (India) [SR/S4/MS: 761/12]","Dr. Bera acknowledges the financial assistance from Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi under the Research Project (F.

In this model, the interval number and expected value based on Me are adopted to handle the uncertain coefficients contained in the objective function and constraints, then a stochastic-based robust optimization method is developed to get a solution that can resist the uncertain environment. To solve the complex and non-linear bi-level multi-follower model, an interactive fuzzy programming technique combined an effective multi-objective algorithm, NSGA-II, is designed as the solution method.

However, product deletion or discontinuation is also critical. Despite its strategic importance, product deletion has received relatively less attention in both academia and practice. Researchers have conceptually investigated product deletion, its influence on firm's resources, the factors influencing product deletion decisions, and the product deletion process. However, very few papers have related product deletion decisions to supply chain management, especially when leanness and sustainability are major objectives. This paper aims to integrate lean and sustainable supply chain dimensions with product deletion by proposing a multilevel decision model that can facilitate a product deletion decision with an objective of developing a leaner and more sustainable supply chain. The model has three major decision dimensions with 8 factors with 29 influencing determinants. The model uses an integrated analytical hierarchy/network process (AHP/ANP) and a benefits, opportunities, cost and risks (BOCR) analysis. An illustrative company scenario is provided for the model application. The paper contributes by filling an important gap by integrating lean and sustainable supply chain management and product deletion literature to formulate a product deletion decision making model which aids in enhancing the leanness and sustainability of supply chains. The model also allows for cross-functional participation involving marketing, operations, finance, and environmental sustainability fields.","[Zhu, Qingyun; Shah, Purvi; Sarkis, Joseph] Worcester Polytech Inst, Foisie Business Sch, 100 Inst Rd, Worcester, MA 01609 USA","Shah, P (corresponding author), Worcester Polytech Inst, Foisie Business Sch, 100 Inst Rd, Worcester, MA 01609 USA.",qzhu@wpi.edu; pshah@wpi.edu; jsarkis@wpi.edu,"Shah, Purvi/F-6897-2015; Sarkis, Joseph/F-4508-2014; jam, amir/O-6460-2019","Shah, Purvi/0000-0002-6672-6934; Sarkis, Joseph/0000-0003-0143-804X; Zhu, Qingyun/0000-0001-8526-2664",,,,75,17,17,6,48,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-5273,1873-7579,,INT J PROD ECON,Int.

It has been estimated that about 35% of food consumption depends directly on the pollination of fruit and vegetable crops. A Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) case-study is applied in the agro-food sector to assess the social and socio-economic aspects of the life cycle of honey through the Subcategory Assessment Method (SAM). The objectives of this paper are three-fold: i) evaluate the capability of S-LCA to capture the complexity of a multifunctional product, which delivers fundamental ecosystem services with consequences at environmental, economic and social levels; ii) identify how to define and represent, with robust indicators, the positive social aspects generated by honey life cycle; iii) identify the steps to improve the S-LCA methodology, especially for its application to complex product systems, such as the agri-food ones. This paper presents a methodological framework to support decision makers in order to evaluate the social sustainability of the Italian honey sector. The presence of positive social aspects in the life cycle of a jar of honey was highlighted as well as a strong connection between the honey product and local community. Furthermore, a weak relation between suppliers along the entire supply chain emerged. The findings lead to the conclusion that further developments are required in order to improve the assessment of the multifunctional product and to reinforce the awareness of the social sustainability by starting from strong collaborations within the supply chain.

Therefore, we aim to improve the implementation of SPC by identifying and evaluating the barriers in supply chains. The limitation of necessary resources to remove the barriers requires the organizations to investigate and prioritize the challenges. The proposed framework in this paper applies fuzzy Analytical Network Process for the evaluation. The framework classifies the key barriers into organization, supply chain, regulation, and customer dimensions which the first two are designed to be internal dimensions and the other two are external. A real case from fitting industry is studied and the related supply chain is entirely considered to examine the proposed approach of this study. The results show that for implementation of SPC the internal barriers are of greater concern compared to the external barriers. The organization dimension obtained the highest rank followed by customer, supply chain and regulation barrier dimensions. (C) 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Long established in-situ construction practices are thus being replaced by processes imported from the manufacturing sector, where component fabrication takes place within a factory environment. As a result of this transformation, current construction supply chains, which have focused on the delivery of raw materials to sites, are no longer apt and need to make way to new, strengthened, and time-critical logistics systems. The aim of this study is to establish a mathematical model for the optimisation of logistics processes in modular construction covering three tiers of operation: manufacturing, storage and assembly. Previous studies have indicated that construction site delays constitute the largest cause of schedule deviations. Using the model outlined in this paper we seek to determine how factory manufacturing and inventory management should react to variations in the demand on construction sites. A two-stage stochastic programming model is developed to capture all possible demand variations on site. The model is evaluated using a case study from the residential construction sector. The application shows that the model is effective and can serve as decision support to optimise modular construction logistics.","[Hsu, Pei-Yuan; Aurisicchio, Marco] Imperial Coll London, Dyson Sch Design Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Angeloudis, Panagiotis] Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England","Hsu, PY (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dyson Sch Design Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England.",p.hsu15@imperial.ac.uk,"Aurisicchio, Marco/U-8070-2019",,Laing O'Rourke; Top University Strategic Alliance (TUSA) PhD scholarships from Taiwan; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); Innovate UKUK Research & Innovation (UKRI) [EP/L504683/1],The authors acknowledge the support of Laing O'Rourke and the Top University Strategic Alliance (TUSA) PhD scholarships from Taiwan.

In the event of a disruption, the sustainability of a supply chain will be compromised as a consequence of attempting to quickly recover from the disruption with minimal costs. However, a balance can be achieved between sustainability and recovery. Companies can maintain its sustainability, while recovering its operations with a comprehensive analysis of the decision criteria for the intended system. This study presents a recovery model of a two-stage serial supply chain subject to supply disruption with consideration of safety stock and carbon emission. The system consists of a single manufacturer and a single retailer, while the carbon emission consideration is from the transportation activities during the recovery cycle. The model is capable of determining the new recovery schedule of the manufacturer and the retailer, the optimal safety stock level, and the carbon emission cost impact during recovery. The results show that for a range of short disruption periods, the optimal safety stock level is significantly affected by the holding cost values. Furthermore, the cost of carbon emission is dependent on the number of recovery cycles, the distance between supply chain entities, and the social cost of carbon at the time of the disruption. A comparison of two disruption scenarios with different transportation arrangement illustrates a solution for a better recovery plan with faster recovery cycles, lower total recovery cost, and without any change to carbon emission cost impact. This study contributes to the supply disruption literature with the findings on how safety stock and environmental effect consideration affect the disruption recovery decision-making process in term of lot sizing and transportation arrangement.

Currently, the lignocellulosic biofuel industry relies on a conventional system where feedstock is harvested, baled, stored locally, and then delivered in a low-density format to the biorefinery. However, the conventional supply chain system causes operational disruptions at the biorefinery mainly due to seasonal availability, handling problems, and quality variability in biomass feedstock. Operational disruptions decrease facility uptime, production efficiencies, and increase maintenance costs. For a low-value high-volume product where margins are very tight, system disruptions are especially problematic. In this work we evaluate an advanced system strategy in which a network of biomass processing centers (depots) are utilized for storing and preprocessing biomass into stable, dense, and uniform material to reduce feedstock supply disruptions, and facility downtime in order to boost economic returns to the bioenergy industry. A database centric discrete event supply chain simulation model was developed, and the impact of operational disruptions on supply chain cost, inventory and production levels, farm metrics and facility metrics were evaluated. Three scenarios were evaluated for a 7-year time-period: (1) bale-delivery scenario with biorefinery uptime varying from 20 to 85%; (2) pellet-delivery scenario with depot uptime varying from 20 to 85% and biorefinery uptime at 85%; and (3) pellet-delivery scenario with depot and biorefinery uptime at 85%. In scenarios 1 and 2, tonnage discarded at the field edge could be reduced by increasing uptime at facility, contracting fewer farms at the beginning and subsequently increasing contracts as facility uptime increases, or determining alternative corn stover markets. Harvest cost was the biggest contributor to the average delivered costs and inventory levels were dependent on facility uptimes. We found a cascading effect of failure propagating through the system from depot to biorefinery. Therefore, mitigating risk at a facility level is not enough and conducting a system-level reliability simulation incorporating failure dependencies among subsystems is critical.","[Sharma, Bhavna; Webb, Erin G.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Environm Sci Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA; [Clark, Robin] QMT Grp, Knoxville, TN USA; [Hilliard, Michael R.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Energy & Transportat Sci Div, Oak Ridge, TN USA","Webb, EG (corresponding author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Environm Sci Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA.",webbeg@ornl.gov,,,"U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Bioenergy Technologies OfficeUnited States Department of Energy (DOE)","This material is based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Bioenergy Technologies Office.",,45,4,4,0,8,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-598X,,,FRONT ENERGY RES,Front.

In a closed-loop supply chain, production planning is influenced by uncertainty not only from customers' demand, but also from collectors due to difficulties in the reverse logistics flow. Therefore, it is important to develop a robust closed-loop supply chain model to respond to uncertainty from reverse logistics. In this study, we develop a deterministic mixed-integer optimization model and robust counterparts to cope with the uncertainty of recycled products and customer demand in the fashion industry. We show that a robust counterpart with a budget of uncertainty is equivalent to a robust counterpart with a box uncertainty under special conditions. To avoid the conservatism of a robust solution, an alternative optimization problem is developed to take advantage of the budget of uncertainty. To verify the performance of the proposed model, numerical experiments are conducted. The simulation results show the proposed model responds robustly to uncertainty and is superior to a deterministic model and other robust counterparts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The main natural resources investigated include crops, forestry, rangeland, aquatic products, coal, crude oil & natural gas, ferrous metal ores, nonferrous metal ores, nonmetallic minerals and other primary energy, and exergy is adopted as a common metric for the resource accounting. In 2012, the total domestic resource exergy input into Chinese economic system amounted to 130.1 EJ, of which 44.6% was induced by investment demands. The embodied resource use (ERU) in China's exports was equivalent to over one fifth of its domestic resource supply. The two integrative sectors of Manufacturing and Construction accounted for 44.1% and 28.7% of the national total ERU, respectively. We identified critical supply chain paths starting from resource extraction to final demand, as well as key industrial sectors in driving the extraction, transmission and final use of embodied resources. The top 50 paths were responsible for 30.4 EJ of the ERU. The identification of resource supply chains from a systemic perspective is of great importance when resource and environmental policies are to be applied to concrete industrial sectors and other economic agents. Integrated approaches that take account of consumption-based resource indicators should be developed for resource conservation and cleaner production, particularly for the economic system with a complex supply network.

This is necessitated in particular, by the limited and scattered availability of biomass or its residues, links to agricultural and forestry activities and associated socio-economic sustainability issues like land use, harvesting, transporting and economic conversion plant supplies. Such socio-economic studies, done prior to the project, can reflect a lot on the feasibility of projects, likely impacts and even help to optimize facility locations, network configurations or fleet management at various points or on the whole the supply chain. When the studies are done in retrospect of the project, as impact studies, they show how bioenergy projects can transform societies. The impact studies can then be useful precursors to similar projects within the same country/region or other similar regions. This review classifies socio-economic study literature into 'viability' studies- done prior to the project; and 'impact' studies- usually done after the project, except for 'projected impact studies'. The studies are also classified as 'quantitative and systematic' or 'qualitative'. Nonetheless, there are occasional overlaps between these study classes. Intentionally designed integrated approaches could actually give more comprehensive results, although in most cases, they result in complex models. This classification can guide researchers to make the right choice of the socio-economic study to carry out based on their objectives.","[Charis, Gratitude; Danha, Gwiranai; Muzenda, Edison] Botswana Int Univ Sci & Technol, Chem Mat & Met Engn, Private Bag 16, Palapye, Botswana","Charis, G (corresponding author), Botswana Int Univ Sci & Technol, Chem Mat & Met Engn, Private Bag 16, Palapye, Botswana.",gratitude.charis@studentmail.biust.ac.bw,,,,,,64,1,1,0,1,CISA PUBLISHER,PADOVA,"VIA BEATO PELLEGRINO, 23, PADOVA, 35137, ITALY",2611-4127,2611-4135,,DETRITUS,Detritus,SEP,2018,3,,,,,,47,57,,10.31025/2611-4135/2018.13687,,,11,"Engineering, Environmental",Engineering,IH7LV,WOS:000474686200009,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

To overcome these problems the supply chains must be more smarter. For establishing a large-scale of smart infrastructure to merge data, information, products, physical objects and all processes of supply chain, we applies the internet of things (IOT) in supply chain management (SCM) through building a smart and secure system of SCM. We have prepared a website for suppliers and managers. We tracked the flow of products at each stage in supply chain management through the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. Each product attached with RFID tag and scanned through RFID reader and ESP8266 at each phase of supply chain management. After scanning the tag we stores tag id in the database. All information about products will be entered by suppliers and then uploaded to managers. In our system the supplier and manager gets perfect information of the entire life cycle of goods, and this will achieve transparency of supply chain management. For assessing security criteria of proposed system of supply chain management, we also proposed a framework which integrates neutrosophic Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (N-DEMATEL) technique with analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The neutrosophic Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (N-DEMATEL) technique is utilized to infer cause and effect interrelationships among criteria of smart supply chain security requirements. Depending on obtained information from (N-DEMATEL) the neutrosophic AHP is utilized to calculate weight of criteria and sub-criteria. Then the integrated framework will help researchers and practitioners to design secure system of supply chains.

In the Philippines, 30% of inspected drug stores in 2003 were found with substandard/spurious/falsely-labeled/falsified/counterfeit drugs. The economic burden on the population drug expenditures and on governments is high. The Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) encourages the public to check the certificates of product registration and report any instances of counterfeiting. The National Police of Philippines responds to such reports through a special task force. However, no literature on its impact on the distribution of such drugs were found. Blockchain technology is a cryptographic ledger that is allegedly immutable through repeated sequential hashing and fault-tolerant through a consensus algorithm. This project will develop and test a pharmacosurveillance blockchain system that will support information sharing along the official drug distribution network. Objective: This study aims to develop a pharmacosurveillance blockchain system and test its functions in a simulated network. Methods: We are developing a Distributed Application (DApp) that will run on smart contracts, employing Swarm as the Distributed File System (DFS). Two instances will be developed: one for Ethereum and another for Hyperledger Fabric. The proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm of Ethereum will be modified into a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) or practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm as it is scalable and fits the drug supply chain environment. The system will adopt the GS1 pedigree standard and will satisfy the data points in the data standardization guidelines from the US FDA. Simulations will use the following 5 nodes: for FDA, manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, and the consumer portal. Results: Development is underway. The design of the system will place FDA in a supervisory data verification role, with each pedigree type-specific data source serving a primary data verification role. The supply chain process will be initiated by the manufacturer, with recursive verification for every transaction. It will allow consumers to scan a code printed on the receipt of their purchases to review the drug distribution history. Conclusions: Development and testing will be conducted in a simulated network, and thus, results may differ from actual practice. The project being proposed is disruptive; once tested, the team intends to engage the Philippine FDA to discuss implementation plans and formulate policies to facilitate adoption and sustainability.","[Sylim, Patrick; Liu, Fang; Fontelo, Paul] Natl Lib Med, NIH, Bldg 38A,Room B1N30 8600 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20894 USA; [Marcelo, Alvin] Univ Philippines, Stand & Interoperabil Lab Asia, Manila, Philippines","Sylim, P (corresponding author), Natl Lib Med, NIH, Bldg 38A,Room B1N30 8600 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20894 USA.",patrick.sylim@nih.gov,"Bolivar, Manuel Pedro Rodriguez/K-2911-2012; Sanchez-Gomez, Nicolas/K-3758-2014","Bolivar, Manuel Pedro Rodriguez/0000-0001-8959-7664; Marcelo, Alvin/0000-0001-6250-9169","Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health, National Library of MedicineUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Library of Medicine (NLM); Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications","This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications.

Thus, green supply chain redesign has been put forward but implementation of related practices faces many barriers. Using the case of the Africa cashew industry, which produces over half of global raw cashew nuts but only process less than 10% to kernel, this paper systematically identifies these barriers considering stakeholders through the whole cashew supply chain. Based on evaluation of four experts, results by grey Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory reveal that successful green supply chain redesign implementation needs two elementary efforts by kernel distributors. One is increased collaboration with multi-tier suppliers (producer organizations and processors) and the other is to get strategic support from industry bodies, non-governmental organizations and development agencies. Additionally, in the short-term, kernel distributors need to overcome three key operational barriers, lack of internal top-level management commitment, lack of integrated management information and traceability systems, and uncertainty of economic benefits. Furthermore, barriers such as difficulties to assess environmental sustainability performance and lack of consumer demand for green cashew should be addressed in the long-term. This study contributes to identify barriers to the successful implementation of green supply chain redesign from perspectives of both the focal enterprise and the whole supply chain. A robust multi-criteria decision making method further reveals the most important and fundamental barriers which can offer decision support for kernel distributors and policymakers in the cashew industry.","[Agyemang, Martin; Antarciuc, Elena] Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Dalian 116024, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Qinghua] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, 1954 Huashan Rd, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Adzanyo, Mary] Competit Cashew Initiat, 32Nortei Ababio Str, Accra, Ghana; [Zhao, Senlin] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Sch Econ & Management, 1550 Haigang Ave, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China","Zhu, QH (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, 1954 Huashan Rd, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.",martinon463@gmail.com; qhzhu@sjtu.edu.cn; mary.adzanyo@giz.de; eantarciuc@mail.dlut.edu.cn; slzhao@shmtu.edu.cn,"Agyemang, Martin/AAI-7054-2020; Zhu, Qinghua/M-3408-2016","Agyemang, Martin/0000-0002-9313-1207; Zhu, Qinghua/0000-0003-2648-0260","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71632007, 71690241, 71472021]; Deutsche Gesellschaft fur internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ)","This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (71632007, 71690241, and 71472021) and Deutsche Gesellschaft fur internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ).",,140,21,21,7,82,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

Moreover, the paper provides industry insights by exemplifying the value of the proposed framework for the UK food industry. A critical review on the most acknowledged sustainability assessment methodologies and tools resulted in the synthesis of the proposed framework. An illustrative application follows, based on data from semi-structured interviews with C-level executives from key players of the UK poultry sector. The results demonstrate an easy-to-use approach, with a comprehensive and sharp outcome on supply chain sustainability performance assessment. Industry insights demonstrate an adequate sustainability performance with respect to the entire supply chain. A detailed view on different echelons reveals specific areas that could be improved, such as the environmental performance at both farming (production) and processing levels. This work extends the scope of current sustainability performance assessment tools by providing a tangible triple bottom-line overview, as well as echelon-specific and indicator-specific details, in a user-friendly, yet straightforward, way. UK food industry insights are valuable for practitioners and academics. The illustration is based exclusively on C-level executives' viewpoint; thus, any generalization of the results should be considered to this effect.

This study proposed new determinants, namely risk analysis and perceived IT security risk as an extension of the Technology Organization Environment (TOE) model. The data collected from the industry experts were analyzed using SEM and ANN approaches. The results of SEM revealed that trust (T), management style (MS), technology innovation (TI), risk analysis (RA), and perceived IT security risk (PITR) exercised a significant influence on CCA. The SEM results were taken as inputs for the ANN approach and ISM methodology. The results of ANN highlighted that perceived IT security risk, trust, and management style were the most important determinants for CCA. On the other hand, the ISM tool identified five factors, namely, decrease of internal systems availability (F1) (PITR cluster), utilization of internal resources (F14) (MS cluster), assurance of data privacy increases adoption rate (F16) (T cluster), innovativeness (F21), and previous experience (F22) (both from the TI cluster) as the top five significant variables with high driving power, among the 43 factors.

The objective functions can minimize the total cost, maximize the total volume flexibility, and minimize the total number of vehicles hired in order to fulfill the paper industry's policies towards a cleaner and green environment. In addition, a novel hybrid solution is presented based on stochastic programming, robust optimization, and fuzzy goal programming. A numerical example utilizing the real data from the paper industry in East Azerbaijan of Iran is designed, and the model performance is assessed.

To mitigate the supply disruption risk, the authors investigate two types of procurement strategies for a firm with two ordering opportunities. Through establishing Stackelberg game models, the authors drive the supplier's optimal production, and the firm's optimal procurement and replenishment strategies under the option purchase (OP) strategy and the procurement commitment (PC) strategy, respectively. The findings show that, under both types of strategies, the firm's procurement follows a threshold principle. Moreover, the firm's procurement quantity can be represented by two newsvendor solutions. A lower option price or option exercise price benefits the firm, while it damages the supplier. The supplier benefits from a higher mean value (MV) of emergency procurement price and the firm benefits from a lower market demand variability. Counter-intuitively, a lower MV of the emergency procurement price is not always beneficial to the firm. A higher market demand variability could be beneficial to the supplier under the PC strategy. The firm should first choose the PC strategy and then change to the OP strategy as the disruption risk increases.","[Xue, Kelei; Xu, Ya; Feng, Lipan] Nankai Univ, Business Sch, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China","Xu, Y (corresponding author), Nankai Univ, Business Sch, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China.",xkl7111@163.com; xuya@nankai.edu.cn; hnnuflp@163.com,"Xue, Kelei/I-9487-2019; feng, lipan/AAF-7486-2020","Xue, Kelei/0000-0001-9551-882X; ","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71602115, 71704001, 71802143]; Humanities and Social Sciences Research of the Ministry of Education of ChinaMinistry of Education, China [18YJC630260]","This work is supported by (i) National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), Research Fund Nos. 71602115, 71704001 and 71802143; (ii) the Humanities and Social Sciences Research of the Ministry of Education of China, Research Fund No. 18YJC630260.",,41,0,0,3,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2018,10,9,,,,,,,3293,10.3390/su10093293,,,32,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GW3DA,WOS:000446770200336,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

Clustering analysis can divide the groups constructing the strong connecting supply chain with large emissions from the global supply chain network, and structural path betweenness represents how much CO2 emissions from the supply chain paths a sector has in global supply chain network. I applied the combined method to the EORA database which covers 189 countries and focused on the whole global supply chain networks in detail. The results demonstrate that the global supply chain networks of transport equipment were well separated into emission clusters with higher emissions that consist of sectors with higher structural path betweenness. Chinese emission clusters were identified from the global supply chain networks for the five countries in question and the betweenness of Chinese sectors tend to be higher values in the supply chain networks.

The local food system is visualized using geo-social data from 110 farms and 224 markets around Baltimore County, Maryland, with 699 connections between them. Network behavior is explored through policy document review and interviews. The findings revealed a small-world architecture, with system resiliency built-in by diversified marketing practices at central nodes. This robust network design helps to explain the long-term survival of local food systems despite the meteoric rise of global industrial food supply chains. Modern alternative food networks are an example of a movement that seeks to reorient economic power structures in response to a variety of food system-related issues not limited to consumer health but including environmental impacts. Uncovering the underlying network architecture of this sustainability-oriented social movement helps reveal how it weaves systemic change more broadly. The methods used in this study demonstrate how social values, social networks, markets, and governance systems embed to transform both physical landscapes and human bodies. Network actors crafted informal policy reports, which were directly incorporated in state and local official land-use and economic planning documents.

While previous research has largely relied on experts' insights, the value of patent-based approaches for exploring technological trends has been underestimated in logistics. To address this gap, this study proposes a topic modeling-based approach using logistics-related patents registered at the United States Patents and Trademark Office (USPTO). The core of the suggested approach is latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), allowing the identification of logistics-related technological topics behind patents. The topics identified by LDA are further investigated regarding both filed-level and firm-level trends. The suggested approach is expected to offer implications of the use of patents for the purpose of exploring the trends of technology development outside the organization in logistics. In addition, we believe that the information on the technological topics and their trends generated by the suggested approach can offer an enhanced understanding of the technological landscape in logistics.","[Choi, Donghyun; Song, Bomi] Korea Aerosp Univ, Sch Air Transportat & Logist, Goyang Si 10540, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea","Song, B (corresponding author), Korea Aerosp Univ, Sch Air Transportat & Logist, Goyang Si 10540, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",dchoi@kau.ac.kr; bmsong@kau.ac.kr,,,2017 Korea Aerospace University Faculty Research Grant,This work was supported by the 2017 Korea Aerospace University Faculty Research Grant.,,117,2,2,4,28,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2018,10,8,,,,,,,2810,10.3390/su10082810,,,26,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GW3CI,WOS:000446767700226,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

In the corporate or multi-business companies, it is possible to share a number of resources between different SCs to achieve synergy and reduce costs. This paper addresses the strategic-tactical SC planning decisions (i.e., SC network design and master planning) in an uncertain environment for allied SCs belong to a single corporate. First, a fuzzy mixed-integer mathematical programming model that considers the imprecise nature of critical parameters such as cost coefficients, capacity levels, market demands is developed for integrated design of two SCs. Then, a robust possibilistic programming model is proposed to cope with the inherent uncertainty in the model parameters. The proposed model is able to achieve significant cost synergies via integrating the design of corporate SCs. Using hypothetical data inspired by an industrial case, the performance and applicability of the proposed models are investigated via experimental evaluations.

To convert the proposed multi objective model into a single objective one, the bounded objective function method is used.

An enterprise must have an appropriate assessment model to address the complexities of green purchasing. Most green purchasing studies have focused on the use of green criteria in the selection of suppliers to develop sustainable operations. By contrast, there have been few articles on green supply chain management discussing both green supplier evaluation and order allocation. This study proposes a novel model that integrates the best worst method (BWM), modified fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), and fuzzy multi-objective linear programming (FMOLP) to solve problems in green supplier selection and order allocation. We demonstrated the proposed method using actual data provided by an electronics company. The results indicate that this model can effectively evaluate the performance of green suppliers and can also optimize order allocation for qualified suppliers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the rising environmental pressure and economic benefit, the reverse supply chain design for hazardous products is becoming increasingly important and urgent. In this paper, we consider the closed-loop supply chain network design for hazardous products (HP-CLSCND), including both forward supply chain and reverse supply chain. The uncertainty inherent in closed-loop supply chain network will significantly influence the overall performance of the closed-loop supply chain network design. This paper focuses on the HP-CLSCND problem with uncertain demands and returns, and a two-stage stochastic programming model (scenario-based) is proposed, in which a risk restriction constraint and reward-penalty mechanism are simultaneously considered. Two solution approaches, parallel enumeration method (PEM) and genetic algorithm (GA) are designed to solve the proposed model. The PEM is an exact solution approach and can rapidly obtain the global optimal solution of the proposed model by utilizing multiply processors. Finally, an application example is provided to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model and two solution approaches. The performance of PEM is evaluated by speedup radio. In addition, the sensitivity analyses about maximum acceptable risk and reward-penalty intensity are conducted, and some management insights for the government are obtained. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this model, the uncertain demand is assumed as a function of price offered to the customers by the supply chain and its rival. The proposed model determines outsourcing strategies, pricing decisions that maximize the total profit in such a competitive situation and minimizes the amount of CO2 emissions by production processes. A hybrid approach combining Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (K-K-T) conditions and possibilistic method was developed to solve the fuzzy bi-level model.

This evolutionary sequence extends from lean to green and to sustainable supply chains; as well as from agile to leagile and to resilient supply chains. In this research, the sequence of evolution of resilient and sustainable supply chains has been investigated with respect to the positioning of partition line in supply networks. Partition line, which is a point of separation of strategic objectives, can be sensibly positioned in a supply network to fetch the benefits of sustainability and resilience together. Aligning the objectives of sustainability and resilience in a supply network is explained through multiple case analyses of manufacturing networks. Case analysis, as elaborated in this research could help managers in matching and scrutinizing their supply networks by finding analogy of the pertinent case from the explicated model cases. Positioning the partition line in a supply network and assigning strategic objectives on either sides of it open insights into a new category of both sustainability and resilience oriented networks, which is the concept of discussion in the paper.

It has been proven that good warehouse management practices improve the average life of perishable goods. The advances in wireless sensors network (WSN) technology offers the possibility of a smart storage organization. In this paper, a low cost reprogrammable WSN-based architecture for functional warehouse management is proposed. The management is based on the continuous monitoring of environmental parameters (i.e., temperature, light exposure and relative humidity), and on their combination to extract a spatial real-time prediction of the product shelf life. For each product, the quality decay is computed by using a 1st order kinetic Arrhenius model to the whole storage site area. It strives to identify, in a way compatible with the other products' shelf lives, the position within the warehouse that maximizes the food expiration date. The shelf life computing and the first-expired first-out logistic problem are entrusted to a Raspberry Pi-based central unit, which manages a set of automated pallet transporters for the displacement of products, according to the computed shelf lives. The management unit supports several commercial light/temperature/humidity sensor solutions, implementing ZigBee, Bluetooth and HTTP-request interfaces. A proof of concept of the presented pro-active WSN-based architecture is also shown. Comparing the proposed monitoring system for the storage of e.g., agricultural products, with a typical one, the experimental results show an improvement of the expected expiration date of about 1.2 +/- 0.5 days, for each pallet, when placed in a non-refrigerated environment. In order to stress the versatility of the WSN solution, a section is dedicated to the implemented system user interfaces that highlight detecting critical situations and allow timely automatic or human interventions, minimizing the latter.","[De Venuto, Daniela; Mezzina, Giovanni] Politecn Bari, Dept Elect & Informat Engn, I-70125 Bari, Italy","De Venuto, D (corresponding author), Politecn Bari, Dept Elect & Informat Engn, I-70125 Bari, Italy.",daniela.devenuto@poliba.it; giovanni.mezzina@poliba.it,"Mezzina, Giovanni/AAE-4136-2019","Mezzina, Giovanni/0000-0003-3927-8686; DE VENUTO, Daniela/0000-0003-4563-7614",,,,25,4,4,0,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,JUL,2018,18,7,,,,,,,2126,10.3390/s18072126,,,19,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,GQ0UF,WOS:000441334300148,30004468,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2021-03-04

This paper first proposes a novel criteria system for evaluating sustainable suppliers from three aspects and six dimensions, and then introduces an integrated evaluation model with a novel hybrid information aggregation. To verify the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method, a real case of a large supermarket is introduced and analyzed. The research results show that (1) the indicator system based on Triple Bottom Line theory can serve as a framework of sustainable supplier selection for manufacturing and circulation enterprises; (2) the introduction of hybrid information aggregation can effectively handle the uncertainties of indicator scores under the realistic fuzzy environment and objectively reflect the intentions of the scorers; and (3) in comparison with the TOPSIS algorithm, the priority order finally obtained is consistent, but the proposed model shows more robustness in the sensitivity test.","[Zhou, Xiongyong; Xu, Zhiduan] Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China","Xu, ZD (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.",xiongyongzhou@stu.xmu.edu.cn; zhiduanx@xmu.edu.cn,,"Zhou, Xiongyong/0000-0001-5064-7900",,,,166,12,12,1,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2018,10,7,,,,,,,2543,10.3390/su10072543,,,49,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GP5WQ,WOS:000440947600434,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-03-04

A qualitative study, with mainly a managerial focus, is conducted based on interviews, workshops, part-time observations, and document studies. The literature review demonstrates that the three related research fields provide different accounts of LCM: all apply a holistic environmental perspective, but with different emphases and using largely different research methods. The empirical study shows that integration was a common topic at the studied company and that solutions were often sought in tools and processes. Middle management support proved important, and challenging, in these integration efforts. Challenges identified also included further integrating LCM into departments such as purchasing and sales. The constant focus on integration at the studied company implies that LCM work is an ongoing effort. Several integration paths are identified: (1) inclusion of sustainability aspects in tools and processes, (2) finding ways to work around certain organizational levels, and (3) using networks and social interaction to create commitment and integration. Although the concept of LCM implies a holistic approach, LCM in practice reveals a lack of a comprehensive overview of LCM-related initiatives and of involved sustainability practitioners within the studied organization.","[Nilsson-Linden, Hanna; Baumann, Henrikke] Chalmers Univ Technol, Environm Syst Anal, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Rosen, Magnus] Univ Gothenburg, Sch Business Econ & Law, Dept Business Adm, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Diedrich, Andreas] Univ Gothenburg, Sch Business Econ & Law, Gothenburg Res Inst, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden","Nilsson-Linden, H (corresponding author), Chalmers Univ Technol, Environm Syst Anal, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",hanna.linden@chalmers.se,"Nilsson-Linden, Hanna/AAA-7068-2020; Baumann, Henrikke/B-2938-2016","/0000-0003-1550-5557; Baumann, Henrikke/0000-0002-4450-1312",,,,46,8,8,0,14,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0948-3349,1614-7502,,INT J LIFE CYCLE ASS,Int.

In 2016, 5.6 million students were enrolled in the 34% of Brazilian schools located in rural areas, but only 72% had a public water supply network. The objective was to evaluate effectiveness of environmental intervention for water treatment in rural schools of the Western Amazonia, and determine the efficacy of water treatment using a simplified chlorinator on potability standards for turbidity, fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli. Methods: A simplified chlorinator was installed for treatment of potable water in 20 public schools in the rural area of Rio Branco municipality, Acre state, Brazil. Results: Before the intervention, 20% (n = 4), 100% (n = 20) and 70% (n = 14) of schools had water that failed to meet potability standards for turbidity, fecal coliforms and E. coli, respectively. However, after intervention, 70% (p = 0.68), 75% (p < 0.001) and 100% (p < 0.001) of schools complied with potability standards. Discussion: This intervention considerably improved schools' water quality, thus decreasing children's health vulnerability due to inadequate water. Ancillary activities including training, educational lectures, installation of equipment, supply of materials and supplies (65% calcium hypochlorite and reagents) were considered fundamental to achieving success full outcomes. Installation of a simplified chlorinator in rural schools of the Western Amazon is therefore proposed as a social technology aiming at social inclusion, as well as economic and environmental sustainability.","[Ribeiro, Maura Regina; de Abreu, Luiz Carlos; Laporta, Gabriel Zorello] Fac Med ABC, Setor Posgrad Pesquisa & Inovacao, Santo Andre, SP, Brazil; [de Abreu, Luiz Carlos] EMESCAM, Programa Posgrad Polit Publ & Desenvolvimento Loc, Vitoria, ES, Brazil; [Laporta, Gabriel Zorello] Univ Fed ABC, Ctr Engn Modelagem & Ciencias Sociais Aplicadas, Santo Andre, SP, Brazil","Laporta, GZ (corresponding author), Fac Med ABC, Setor Posgrad Pesquisa & Inovacao, Santo Andre, SP, Brazil.; Laporta, GZ (corresponding author), Univ Fed ABC, Ctr Engn Modelagem & Ciencias Sociais Aplicadas, Santo Andre, SP, Brazil.",gabriel.laporta@fmabc.br,"Laporta, Gabriel/B-8662-2012; Laporta, Gabriel/P-3621-2019; de Abreu, Luiz Carlos/B-7873-2012","Laporta, Gabriel/0000-0001-7412-9390; Laporta, Gabriel/0000-0001-7412-9390; de Abreu, Luiz Carlos/0000-0002-7618-2109",Acre Project-Health in the Western Amazonia [007/2015 SESACRE-UFAC-FMABC]; Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2014/09774-1]; Health National Foundation-Rio Branco Government [795710/2013],"This work was supported by the Acre Project-Health in the Western Amazonia (multi-institutional agreement process n. 007/2015 SESACRE-UFAC-FMABC), the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP; n. 2014/09774-1), and the Health National Foundation-Rio Branco Government (agreement n. 795710/2013).

This paper considers the closed loop supply chain network design problem under hybrid uncertainty, while there are two sources of uncertainty for most parameters, thus require fortifying of the robustness of the decision. The first source is that some uncertain parameters may be based on the future scenarios which are considered according to the probability of their occurrence. The second source is that the values of these parameters in each scenario are usually imprecise and can be specified by possibilistic distributions. In this case, the best robust decision has some additional properties in terms of mean value and variability of the objective function. We introduced two types of the variability named scenario variability and possibilistic variability. Possibility theory is used to choose a solution in such a problem and a novel robust fuzzy stochastic programming approach is proposed that has significant advantages. The performance of the proposed model is also compared with that of other models in term of the mean cost and variability by simulation. (C) Elsevier B.V.

This multifunctional system produces high value products such as power, biochar, biochemicals, etc. alongside with the conventional biofuels (e.g., bioethanol). However, these networks are characterized as inherently vulnerable to cascading disruptions in cases of inoperability (i.e., reduction in production levels) of one or more of its component bioenergy plants. The inoperability of bioenergy plants can be caused by supply-side disruptions due to reductions in the available biomass feedstocks (i.e., caused by climate change-induced events) as well as due to seasonal variations in the demand for bioenergy products. It is therefore essential to incorporate these factors in the systematic risk analysis prior to designing of bioenergy parks. This work thus develops an extension to the P-graph based method for criticality analysis in bioenergy parks considering multiple supply-side and demand-side perturbation scenarios. Results show that the average net output reduction in the bioenergy park is higher for multiple plant disruption scenarios and criticality of bioenergy plants is greatly influenced by variations in product demands. The proposed method can be used in the long-term planning and developing of robust bioenergy parks while considering both uncertainties in the supply and demand. A bioenergy park case study is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the P-graph based approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Supply chains become vulnerable due to natural and man-made catastrophes and due to ineffectiveness in operations. Contracts form the basis for communication and relationship management between a buyer and a supplier. We provide an analytical framework that addresses supply chain effectiveness (costs, risks, transaction costs, stakeholder issues) and would help inform managers who grapple with such concerns. We propose three factors (costs, benefits, and risks) that capture the objective nature and one parameter that deals with the subjective nature of sustainable contracts. To illustrate the framework we collect representative cost (objective) data from suppliers, integrate behavioral (subjective) elements, and employ constrained optimization techniques to compare five supplier-engagement contract policies. We then refine this cost-based solution, for a given contract policy, to develop three cost-benefit-risk trade-off formulations and illustrate them using simulated data. The framework addresses supplier and network-based externalities, supplier and network level effectiveness, and transaction costs, and thus provides a mechanism to enable a coordinator-driven sustainable supply network. The analysis informs contract development and evaluation process and helps align buyer-supplier interest in the long-run. We believe the analysis will help build sustainable buyer-supplier relations. Network coordinators who would benefit from our framework include original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), suppliers (say tier-1 suppliers in automotive industry), retailers (especially as retailers pursue private labels and become more involved in manufacturing and branding), etc.","[Dubey, Vivek Kumar; Veeramani, Dharmaraj] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Chavas, Jean-Paul] Univ Wisconsin, Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Dubey, VK (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",vkdubey@wisc.edu; jchavas@wisc.edu; raj@ie.engr.wisc.edu,,"Dubey, Vivek/0000-0003-4749-0273",,,,89,9,9,7,59,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-5273,1873-7579,,INT J PROD ECON,Int.

To identify an efficient way to enhance environmental and operational benefits of CLSC, we use Big Data and propose data-driven approaches to generating robust CLSC designs that mitigate uncertainty and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions burdens. More specifically, in addressing multi-uncertainties (i.e., buyers' expectations, demands, and recovery uncertainties), a distributed robust optimization model (DRO) and an adaptive robust model (ARO) are developed for designing carryings and waste disposal facility locations of CLSC. Both models use historical data based on uncertain parameters for previous periods to make decisions on future stages in a robust way. Moreover, we incorporate K-L divergence into an ambiguous set of uncertain parameters to measure the value of data. The results of numerical analysis show the need to account for K-L divergence in an ambiguous set of DRO models, as GHG emission costs increase even when little K-L divergence disturbance is in place. Furthermore, from the data-driven framework, we find that government subsidies and an accurate estimation method (i.e., less K-L divergence) enhance environmental and operational benefits. Regarding model robustness levels, solutions generated from our ARO models outperform deterministic solutions not only in terms of their average objective value but also in terms of differences from ideal solutions.

This is mainly because of the short product shelf life and the need of high variety. This necessitates the food industry to adopt various quick response systems to achieve effective supply chain management. The situation becomes even more critical when dealing with humanitarian relief operations where time window is very short (usually 24 hours). One of the solutions which are adopted in modern food supply chains is to locate cross-docking centre (CDC). Cross-docking is used to reduce the turnaround time of the food products. The practical situation is complex as it caters to multiple customers. The number of suppliers, in such cases, plays a significant role. Selection of a right CDC is, therefore, a crucial task. It is a strategic decision and needs to be taken by considering the relationships between each stakeholder present in the supply chain. In this article, we present an approach to select one (or few) CDC/s facilities among n CDCs. The method is based on the relationship between each actor (actors are the stakeholders in the supply chain). The relationship is in terms of the physical flow of materials or information flow or another kind of flows or relationships that connects them to form a network. These network characteristics are required to find out key stakeholders. The present article proposes the application of social network analysis (SNA) to analyse the characteristics of the network, thus helping supply chain managers to locate strategic CDCs considering both qualitative and quantitative aspects. The proposed methodology can be easily extended to locate temporary warehouse site in the context of humanitarian relief operations.","[Barsing, Prashant] Narsee Monji Inst Management Studies NMIMS, Sch Business Management, Bombay, Maharashtra, India; [Daultani, Yash] Atal Bihari Vajpayee Indian Inst Informat Technol, Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, India; [Vaidya, Omkarprasad S.; Kumar, Sushil] Indian Inst Management IIM Lucknow, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India","Daultani, Y (corresponding author), Atal Bihari Vajpayee Indian Inst Informat Technol, Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, India.",yash.daultani@gmail.com,,"Daultani, Yash/0000-0003-2739-5607",,,,27,5,5,1,52,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0972-1509,0973-0664,,GLOB BUS REV,Glob.

The bio-fuel is derived from biomass that is obtained from agricultural products such as plant debris. In addition, the supply chain is affected by risks which are due to several reasons such as economic, natural phenomena, political and etc. The occurrence of such events can cause disruption in supply chain which can significantly increase the total supply chain costs and also prevent serve to customers. Reliability is involved the capability of a network to achieve an anticipated process such as communication. Analysis of network reliability has acknowledged significant consideration and is consequently broadly studied to forecast and avoid any network failure. In order to distribute bio-fuel to the customers, designing a reliable and sustainable bio-fuel supply chain is very importance. Thus a growth in bio-fuel production demonstrates the requirement for establishing an effective and reliable network of chain that not only accomplishes sound under regular circumstances nevertheless restricted risk under various unanticipated disruption situations. This paper presents mathematical model to design an efficient bio-fuel supply chain network at pre-disaster stage that considering failure in the connecting links between the facilities. In which the probability of failure of the links is forecasted by a spatial statistic approach and also due to the fact that disasters can cause disruptions in bio-refineries, leads to use the risk-pooling effect in order to reduce total costs. In order to solve the proposed mathematical model, two meta-heuristic algorithms containing genetic algorithm (GA) and bat algorithm (BA) are utilized. The results show that by increasing the reliability and improvement of connecting links between facilities and considering the risk-pooling effect on disrupted bio-refineries, the total costs of supply chain can be considerably reduced.
