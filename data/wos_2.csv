Unlike other studies in the literature that use exclusively linear models, we apply nonlinear neural networks to model the relationship between performance improvement and a set of predictor variables of EDI usage and supply chain coordination activities. A variable selection method is employed to identify key factors to predict a firm's operational excellence due to EDI implementation. In addition, a bootstrap resampling scheme is used to evaluate the robustness of the results. Note to Practitioners-Competing successfully in a highly competitive environment requires firms to coordinate well with their suppliers and customers. In this paper, we study the issue of how EDI implementation activities and usage affect a firm's performance. Our research has several important implications to practitioners. First, although a firm's performance improvement in several key areas may be attributed to many different aspects of EDI use and coordination activities, only a few key variables are critical. By focusing on a few key coordination activities and EDI implementation issues, managers are able to achieve significant performance improvement in efficiency, productivity, and competitiveness. Second, we find that coordination activities through the implementation of EDI can clearly improve many facets of a firm's performance, developing strategic alliances with supply chain partners is essential in enhancing both a firm's and its supply chain's competitiveness. Third, while using the basic routine EDI can improve efficiency, it is the enhanced use of the EDI system that contributes more to the productivity improvement and firm competitiveness.","[Zhang, G.

Critical environmental legislation has become common in all level of company operations. Green product design has a significant influence on the cost of purchase, disassembly, component inspection and repair, remanufacturing and recycling. Recently, the development and improved capabilities of ITA have changed the ways in which the supply chain operates. However, the traditional inventory model considers a case in which depletion of inventory is caused by a constant rate. In practice, there is an inventory loss due to deterioration. This paper investigates the impact of the green product design, the deteriorating factor and the ITA investment in business process considering remanufacturing. An integrated inventory deteriorating model is developed, considering green product design and remanufacturing. The integrated production-inventory deteriorating model for replenishment policy and distribution planning is derived utilising a time-weighted inventory approach. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the theory. The results show that new technology evolution, reusable-item take-back ratio and direct shipment are the critical operation factors in green product design and ITA investment.","[Chung, Chun-Jen] Aletheia Univ, Dept Informat Commerce, Tainan 721, Taiwan; [Wee, Hui-Ming] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Chungli 32023, Taiwan","Chung, CJ (corresponding author), Aletheia Univ, Dept Informat Commerce, Tainan 721, Taiwan.",cjchungboy@gmail.com,"santana, elysmara S D/P-2636-2016; Lai, Shun-Te/G-5774-2012",,,,,45,21,21,4,65,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0951-192X,1362-3052,,INT J COMPUT INTEG M,Int.

This is no more acute than within the climate change agenda, the single biggest environmental challenge to industry today. The purpose of this paper is to challenge these notions and suggest that environmental burden actually decreases across increasing logistical scale and supply chain sophistication. Design/methodology/approach - Primary and secondary life cycle analysis and carbon auditing case evidence detailing and describing operations throughout the food supply chain is used to show what happens to resource efficiency when we chose possible downscaling routes. Findings - The paper contends that the principle of economic efficiency leading to environmental efficiency (or lean is green) is more generally applicable against our previous expectations and that supply chain sophistication and logistical scale is more likely to lead to environmental benefit rather than cost. Practical implications - From a commercial and industrial point of view, the paper provides evidence to promote conventional supply chain management good practice as a means of driving the demand needed for the technological change required to achieve climate change targets. This is good news for suppliers and distributors, particularly in the light of global economic conditions. From a consumer and policy perspective, the upshot of the paper is a call for more pragmatic thinking and a reminder that critical evidence-based decision making should be used when judging how best to formulate supply strategies. Originality/value - This paper represents a fresh way of thinking utilising more robust evidence amongst a set of issues that have become precariously muddled and confused.","[Oglethorpe, David; Heron, Graeme] Northumbria Univ, Newcastle Business Sch, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England","Oglethorpe, D (corresponding author), Northumbria Univ, Newcastle Business Sch, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England.",david.oglethorpe@northumbria.ac.uk,,"Oglethorpe, David/0000-0002-6505-1197",,,,49,25,26,0,34,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0957-4093,1758-6550,,INT J LOGIST MANAG,Int.

The explosion in long-distance sourcing is exposing supply chains and shareholder value at ever increasing operational and disruption risks. It is well established, both in academia and in real-world business environments, that resource flexibility is an effective method for hedging against supply chain disruption risks. In this contextual framework, we propose a single period stochastic inventory decision-making model that could be employed for capturing the trade-off between inventory policies and disruption risks for an unreliable dual sourcing supply network for both the capacitated and uncapacitated cases. Through the developed model, we obtain some important managerial insights and evaluate the merit of contingency strategies in managing uncertain supply chains.","[Iakovou, Eleftherios; Vlachos, Dimitrios; Xanthopoulos, Anastasios] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Ind Management Div, Dept Mech Engn, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece","Iakovou, E (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Ind Management Div, Dept Mech Engn, POB 461, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",eiakovou@auth.gr,,"Vlachos, Dimitrios/0000-0002-0430-2386",,,,39,30,31,1,44,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7721,1464-5319,,INT J SYST SCI,Int.

However, although embeddedness has both a structural and a relational aspect, the structural has received more focus. In addition, circumstances that may affect the development of social capital, and the role and import of a focal firm's supply management function on aspects of social capital, remain unclear. This study draws on the social network perspective to explore factors associated with the relational embeddedness of social capital, and investigate the role of supply management on the process. Using empirical data collected from 204 U.S. manufacturing firms, an empirical framework is proposed and tested using structural equation modeling. The results of this study suggest a mechanism through which social capital affects firm performance, and indicate that the supply management function may contribute to sustainable competitive advantage. The study confirms that the relational embeddedness aspect of social capital should be treated as a critical antecedent to performance. It also highlights the potential role of the supply management function in developing social capital in dyadic network interactions.","Georgia So Univ, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA","Bernardes, ES (corresponding author), Georgia So Univ, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA.",,,,,,,79,70,71,4,67,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",1523-2409,,,J SUPPLY CHAIN MANAG,J.

The supply chain members may lose their production capacities temporarily, which might have significant impacts on the performance of the whole supply chain network. This article proposes a discrete time model to characterise the unreliable production capacity in serial supply chain networks. Based on the proposed model, the exact probability distributions are available for the performance analysis of a single-stage system in the lost sales scenario. The iterative methods are developed to derive the approximate performance measures for single-stage systems in the backorder scenario and multi-stage systems in both the lost sales and backorder scenarios. The proposed methods are verified through a series of numerical experiments. The analysis results suggest that the performance of the supply chain network suffers more from the downstream-stage unreliability than the upstream-stage unreliability. Furthermore, some application examples are illustrated to show the possible solutions for practical problems.","[Wu, Yifan; Dong, Ming] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Dept Operat Management, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China; [Tang, Wei; Chen, F.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper proposes a framework to study the creation and evolution of governance mechanisms over a five-year period. Data from 48 semi-structured interviews and 15 recent and historic documents were also analysed. The interviews were conducted among current and past representatives of all the organisations concerned including coffee traders, NGOs and farmers. Findings - In contrast with literature on the subject, governance mechanisms initially relied mostly on informal mechanisms. Formal governance mechanisms were incorporated into the relationships to enable the supply chain network to grow and to provide clarity to all actors. Relational quality processes that increased trust were critical elements in the early phase, and were explicitly built into a second phase of development. Research limitations/implications - Being a single case study, some caution needs to be applied to generalise findings beyond the specific context studied. An additional methodological limitation is the limited number of actors involved in the overall supply chain network. Practical implications - The paper shows the importance of treating governance mechanisms within the supply chain not as a fixed variable to be determined once and for all in the beginning of a relationship, but rather to adapt the coordination mechanisms of the relationships. Originality/value - The evolution of relationships over time has been often called for but rarely chosen. The case highlights the potential benefits of this type of research to develop an understanding of the evolution of relationships in a supply chain network.","[Alvarez, Gabriela; Pilbeam, Colin] Cranfield Sch Management, Doctoral Res Off, Bedford, England; [Wilding, Richard] Cranfield Sch Management, Ctr Logist & Supply Chain Management, Bedford, England","Alvarez, G (corresponding author), Cranfield Sch Management, Doctoral Res Off, Bedford, England.",gabriela.alvarez@cranfield.ac.uk,"Pilbeam, Colin/C-1926-2016","Pilbeam, Colin/0000-0002-7281-4295; Wilding, Richard/0000-0002-8547-6133",,,,108,85,86,5,145,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1359-8546,1758-6852,,SUPPLY CHAIN MANAG,Supply Chain Manag.,,2010,15,2,,,,,165,182,,10.1108/13598541011028769,,,18,Business; Management,Business & Economics,581AM,WOS:000276492400007,,,,,2021-03-04

As a consequence, various initiatives have been designed and adopted that improve environmental performance while maintaining sustainable development. Green purchasing is applied as a useful tool to mitigate the environmental impacts of consumption and to promote clean production technology. The supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model is proposed by a supply chain council as a standard supply chain performance evaluation model. This model has been widely embraced by many modern organisations. The SCOR model can be applied to analyse supply chain performance in a systematic way. It can also aid in communication among all members in the supply chain, and can assist in the development of a design for a better supply chain network. To further improve the performance of the green purchasing process, which is critical in numerous industries, this study explores the relationship between the plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycle of green purchasing and the SCOR purchasing/sourcing process and its performance indices/metrics. In this study, those companies which produce Taiwanese green label products are taken as samples. The PDSA cycle of green purchasing and the SCOR model are used to construct a structural equation model (SEM). An SEM analysis is conducted to establish the relationship between the PDSA of green purchasing, the sourcing process, and its performance on the SCOR model. The results of this study provide some suggestions for companies conducting green purchasing.","[Hwang, Yeong-Dong] Leader Univ, Dept Operat Management, Tainan, Taiwan; [Wen, Yuan-Feng] Natl Kaohsiung Marine Univ, Dept Logist Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Chen, Mu-Chen] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Traff & Transportat, Taipei, Taiwan","Hwang, YD (corresponding author), Leader Univ, Dept Operat Management, Tainan, Taiwan.",hyd1020@ms11.hinet.net,,,,,,47,24,24,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1478-3363,1478-3371,,TOTAL QUAL MANAG BUS,Total Qual.

A nitrogen network for the U.S. beef supply chain - a small sub-network of the industrial food system analyzed as a pilot study - was constructed and compared to four non-human carbon and nitrogen trophic networks for the Chesapeake Bay and the Florida Everglades. These non-human food webs served as sustainable reference systems. Contrary to the main original hypothesis, the window of vitality and the number of network roles did not clearly differentiate between a human sub-network and the more complete non-human networks. The effective trophic level of humans (a partial estimate of trophic level based on the single food source of beef) was much higher (8.1) than any non-human species (maximum of 4.88). Network connectance, entropy, total dependency coefficients, trophic efficiencies and the ascendency to capacity ratio also indicated differences that serve as hypotheses for future tests on more comprehensive human food webs. The study elucidated important issues related to (1) the steady state assumption, which is more problematic for industrial human systems, (2) the absence or dearth of data on contributions of dead humans and human wastes to feed other species in an integrated food web, (3) the ambiguity of defining some industrial compartments as living versus non-living, and (4) challenges with constructing compartments and trophic transfers in industrial versus non-human food webs. The two main novel results are (1) the progress made toward adapting ecological network analysis (ENA) methodology for analysis of human food networks in industrial cultures and (2) characterizing the critical aspects of comparative ENA for understanding potential causes of the problems, and providing avenues for solutions, for environmental sustainability. Based on this work, construction and comparative network analysis of a more comprehensive industrial human food network seems warranted and likely to provide valuable insights for modifying structures of industrial food networks to be more like natural networks and more sustainable.

Companies need to be able to evaluate and design different configurations for their logistic networks as quickly as possible. This means coordinating the entire supply chain effectively in order to minimize costs and simultaneously optimize facilities location, the allocation of customer demand to production/distribution centers, the inbound and outbound transportation activities, the product flows between production and/or warehousing facilities, the reverse logistics activities, etc. Full optimization of supply chain is achieved by integrating strategic, tactical, and operational decision-making in terms of the design, management, and control of activities. The cost-based and mixed-integer programming model presented in this study has been developed to support management in making the following decisions: the number of facilities (e.g. warehousing systems, distribution centers), the choice of their locations and the assignment of customer demand to them, and also incorporate tactical decisions regarding inventory control, production rates, and service-level determination in a stochastic environment. This paper presents an original model for the dynamic location-allocation problem with control of customer service level and safety stock optimization.

Alternative energy and water resources are widely researched to provide self-sufficiency in scales of single houses to communities a ties, but are still limited to demographical, technological, economical and social factors, which Vary around the Globe. Infra-Free (IF) is all academic research that seeks a synergy between relevant research fields to promote different decentralization scenarios For combined energy and water technologies with best-performance. The Infra-Free Motherboard (IFM) is a proposal for a standardized platform, where installed technologies integrate within a household as robotic systems that evolve into a self-aware artificial platform to provide customized resource management. It addresses a multidirectional, real-time processing artificial resource management system that could develop its own skills by close Interaction with the environment: and the user. The system is enhanced with algorithms and dynamic systems to provide communication between different co-evolving systems that plug-In, adapt, evaluate and finally, customize themselves to dynamically changing environments due to resource availability, local needs, technology readiness and individual choices. I-lie multidirectional real-time processing system further extends into a community application, where Intelligent self-learning systems are aware of the amount and availability of resources in the whole network (community) and control the distribution between subsystems (houses) Using best performance principles. Finally, this provides a dynamically transforming community that learns, adapts and redesigns itself. In this paper; at first, we introduce the standardized IFM and modular sub-system architecture. Next, we describe the hardware (platform) and software (self-learning process) architecture for the purpose to realize a customized real-time energy management system in a community of interconnected houses with a special focus oil energy equation strategies. Next, we study a scenario to apply IFM in a small-scale community (100 people) in Masdar in 2012; integrated with a plug-in car concept, CO2 recycle, evaporative cooling and Stirling engine system.

Caterers are thus seen as agents responsible for sustainable food systems within their reach. This paper explores how public caterers use their position and productive intelligence in promoting a sustainable food system within the power field of their contextual networks. This article crystallises this 'agency for sustainability' as professional identity for sustainability, the shaping of which is analysed in Finnish public catering. The paper identifies eased and positive, troubled and critical as well as delimited and distancing approaches for sustainability, with respective views and efforts for sustainable food systems. The shaping of professional identity for sustainability could serve as co-operative platform for future contextual developments towards more sustainable food systems. Such progress could result in better alignment with political guidelines for sustainability and caterers' satisfaction due to their heightened professional position reaching beyond 'kitchen walls' to construct everyday sustainability.

The success of the closed-loop supply chain depends on actions of both manufacturers and customers. Now, manufacturers require producing products which are easy for disassembly, reuse and remanufacturing owing to the law of environmental protection. On the other hand, the number of customers supporting environmental protection by delivering their used products to collection points is increasing. According to the findings, the total cost spent in reverse logistics is huge. In order to minimize the total reverse logistics cost and high utilization rate of collection points, selecting appropriate locations for collection points is critical in reverse logistics. This paper proposes a genetic algorithm to determine such locations in order to maximize the coverage of customers. Also, the use of RFID is suggested to count the quantities of collected items in collection points and send the signal to the central return center. This can facilitate the vehicle scheduling for transferring the items from collection points to the return center. The significance of this research is the proposal of RFID-based reverse logistics framework and optimization of locations of collection points which allow economically and ecologically reasonable recycling. Simulation results indicated that the genetic algorithm is able to produce good-quality solutions in terms of coverage of collection points by choosing suitable locations for collection points and RFID can help detect the quantity of returned products so as to increase efficiency of logistics operations.

The ability to identify which supplier has greater potential of a disruption is a critical first step in managing the frequency and impact of these disruptions that often significantly impact on the supply chain. This paper presents preliminary research concepts regarding a new approach to the identification and prediction of supply risk. This approach to the assessment and classification of suppliers is based on supplier's attributes, performances and supply chain characteristics, while it is also modified by factors in the supplier's specific environment. The challenges posed to supply chains due to a turbulent environment (both from within the industry and external influences) are examined. A new method for the assessment and classification of suppliers based on their characteristics, performances and the environment of the industry in which they operate is presented. The findings are explained within the contingency theory. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In real-world cases, demand, traveling time or any parameters in classical models may change over the period of time. So, considering uncertainty yields more flexibility for the results and the proposed model. In our study, environmental uncertainty is described by discrete scenarios. In this model, we have service level constraint in order to prevent inventory lost in distribution centers (DCs). Also, we assume that customer's demand is stochastic with Poisson distribution function and DCs have coverage radius constraints thus any DC cannot service all the customers. In this model, location of DCs is selected and optimized and the best flow of products from supplier to DCs also from DCs to customers is determined. In this way, the customers' demand should be satisfied at least service level. To solve this nonlinear integer programming model we first present a new and robust solution based on a genetic search framework and then based on genetic algorithm results and some optimizer rules we propose a new heuristic method. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. Ail rights reserved.","[Ghezavati, V. R.; Jabal-Ameli, M.

J,"Christopher, M; Gaudenzi, B",,,,"Christopher, Martin; Gaudenzi, Barbara",,,Exploiting knowledge across networks through reputation management,INDUSTRIAL MARKETING MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Strategic network; Knowledge management; Reputation; Reputational risk,TRUST; COMMUNICATION; IMAGE,"The emerging paradigm of network competition is increasingly in evidence across many industrial sectors and provides further support for the idea that 'supply chains compete, not companies'. It can be argued that network competition requires a much greater focus on managing the interfaces that connect the individual players in that network and exchanging and leveraging knowledge across the network. This paper sets out to establish a framework whereby the critical interfaces and the knowledge sharing benefits can be identified and how the strength of the relationships at those interfaces can become the basis for building organisational reputation and create an environment more conducive to co-operation and knowledge sharing. Finally, the paper analyses the potential impact of reputational risks in influencing the perception of stakeholders about the organisation. Whilst the idea of value-adding networks based on closely connected providers of capabilities and resources is appealing, it should be recognised that, if not properly managed, the actions of the stakeholders in those networks can impact the risk profile of the business significantly-particularly reputational risk. The more that organisations become part of complex global networks, the more dependent they become upon the other network members for knowledge and other resources. Because of this dependency there is always the danger that the reputation of the focal firm can be damaged by the actions of other network members, hence reducing the likelihood of future collaborative working and knowledge exploitation. Using examples drawn from a variety of industries, the paper highlights the potential for reputational risk if the critical network interfaces are not closely managed. It will be argued that by actively managing relationships with stakeholders in the network the risk to the organisation's reputation can be mitigated and the sharing of knowledge simultaneously enhanced.

Now, organizations are competing not only with their internal capabilities but also on their abilities to leverage capabilities in the supply chain. Recent studies suggest that strategic alignment in the supply chain, assessed by the degree of matching between supply management and market requirements, is critical for the success of organizations in the global marketplace. The purpose of this paper is to examine the possible linkage between strategic alignment (or lack of) in the supply chain, based on the traditional competitive priorities (i.e. cost, quality, flexibility and delivery), and the type of interactions with suppliers. Design/methodology/approach - Strategic alignment in the supply chain was measured by the difference between customer's requirements and the emphasis that the organization puts on these same requirements in dealing with its suppliers. The types of interactions were assessed by six items, three of them to measure the degree of arm's length practices and the other three to assess the degree of cooperation with suppliers. The empirical analysis used data from 512 manufacturing companies in Canada surveyed in 2003 and 2005. Linear regressions were conducted to test a series of four hypotheses linking alignment in the supply chain and the type of interactions with suppliers. Findings - Interactions with suppliers that are increasingly based on cooperation were found to be linked with a better alignment of competitive priorities that are characteristic of responsive supply chains. An unexpected result was the positive link between arm's length interactions and delivery, a dimension that is also associated with responsive supply chains. Research limitations/implications - The choice of interactions with suppliers can be critical in the alignment of competitive priorities in the supply chain. A limitation is that the empirical analysis rests on data collected from one respondent per organization. Originality/value - This paper contributes to research by providing empirical evidence of the link between the type of interactions with suppliers and the alignment of competitive priorities in the supply chain.","[Vachon, Stephan; Halley, Alain; Beaulieu, Martin] HEC Montreal, Dept Logist & Operat Management, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Vachon, S (corresponding author), HEC Montreal, Dept Logist & Operat Management, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",stephane.vachon@hec.ca,,,,,,65,62,66,0,35,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0144-3577,1758-6593,,INT J OPER PROD MAN,Int.

Design/methodology/approach - This study was commissioned by the World Customs Organization (WCO) at the end of June 2006. Because of increased trade volumes, emerging complex supply networks and heightened security concerns, the WCO saw the need to assess future trends and drivers in supply chain management. The Delphi method was applied to identify a set of foreseeable drivers of change and to assess their predicted impact on global supply chain management in the coming ten to 20 years. Based on a literature review of 150 recent publications and interviews among 33 industry, academic and customs experts, a survey was designed and conducted to collect current and potential change drivers in global supply chains. These drivers were compiled and prioritized by an eclectic team of 12 specialists. Findings - The main results of the study are strongly connected to strategic and operational supply chain planning for the next ten to 20 years. They are related to increased off-shoring of operations through truly global manufacturing, characterized by its intercontinental supply of materials; increased product complexity with shorter product life cycles; increased importance of business-to-governmert networking for operational and security efficiency; introduction of new supply chain services integrating financial, physical and information flows leading to further consolidation in the logistics markets; and the overall increase in risks and vulnerabilities in international supply chains. Originality/value - This paper provides a 360 degree view of the future of international supply chain management and the challenges companies will face to compete in the twenty-first century business environment.","[Hameri, Ari-Pekka] Univ Lausanne, Ecole Hautes Etud Commerciales, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Hintsa, Juha] Cross Border Res Assoc, Lausanne, Switzerland","Hameri, AP (corresponding author), Univ Lausanne, Ecole Hautes Etud Commerciales, Lausanne, Switzerland.",ahameri@unil.ch,,,,,,44,49,49,2,51,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0960-0035,1758-664X,,INT J PHYS DISTR LOG,Int.

Two main hypotheses about the critical success factors of knowledge and technology contribution to sustainable development are tested. Design/methodology/approach - The research is carried out using surveys and interviews among a KM/integrated information and communication technologies (IICTs) sustainable development community Findings - Results show that KM is critical for innovation, prioritization and efficient use of resources. A significant linear association between IICTs and KM across time and geography is detected. IICTs improve the quality of shared decision making in inter- and intra-organizational settings. Paradoxically, IICTs lead to information overload, and digitization leads to knowledge dilution de-contextualization. Nevertheless, these drawbacks are outweighed by the multitude of the converged technologies benefits. Research limitations/implications - There is a limited amount of data subjected to the statistical analysis. This may skew some of the results, and inflate the experimental error. However, the limited data are due to the restricted targeted population itself.

Design/methodology/approach - The foundation is derived by drawing from various well-established organizational theories. Specifically, strategic sourcing was viewed from the perspective of institutional theory, resource dependence theory, network theory, systems, theory, resource/knowledge-based views of the firm, transaction cost economics, agency theory, strategic choice theory, sociocognitive theory, and critical theory. Findings - By viewing strategic sourcing through the lens of ten organizational theories, this research provides multiple insights into many interrelated strategic sourcing questions, such as when to make, buy or ally, how many and which suppliers, and how to manage sourcing relationships. The paper offers a rich and diverse foundation to foster future theory-building activities in sourcing and supply management research. Originality/value - While some of the se theory bases have been utilized, to some degree, in the supply management research, the paper offers a more holistic perspective of theoretical insights for strategic sourcing. Each of these organizational theories could be utilized as a foundation for future studies. Further, the paper offers competing and/or complementary theory bases to enhances possible insights into many strategic sourcing questions such as when to make, bury or ally.","[Shook, Christopher L.; Adams, Garry L.; Ketchen, David J., Jr.] Auburn Univ, Dept Management, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Craighead, Christopher W.] Auburn Univ, Supply Chain Management Program, Auburn, AL 36849 USA","Shook, CL (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Dept Management, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",,,,,,,60,48,48,2,41,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1359-8546,1758-6852,,SUPPLY CHAIN MANAG,Supply Chain Manag.,,2009,14,1,,,,,3,10,,10.1108/13598540910927250,,,8,Business; Management,Business & Economics,416YG,WOS:000264040800001,,,,,2021-03-04

Despite this, however, skills remain limited on quantifying needs for medications and ordering, receiving and storing medications appropriately; recording medications inventories accurately; distributing medications for use appropriately; and advising patients on how to use medications appropriately. The Regional Technical Resource Collaboration for Pharmaceutical Management (RTRC) has been established to help address the problem of skills shortage in pharmaceutical management in East Africa. Methods: The initiative brings together academic institutions from four East African countries to participate in skills-building activities in pharmaceutical supply management. The initiative targeted the institutions' ability to conduct assessments of pharmaceutical supply management systems and to develop and implement effective skills-building programmes for pharmaceutical supply chain management. Results: Over a two-year period, the RTRC succeeded in conducting assessments of pharmaceutical supply management systems and practices in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. In 2006, the RTRC participated in a materials-development workshop in Kampala, Uganda, and contributed to the development of comprehensive HIV/AIDS pharmaceutical management training materials; these materials are now widely available in all four countries. In Tanzania and Uganda the RTRC has been involved with the training of health care workers in HIV/AIDS pharmaceutical management. In Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda the RTRC has been conducting operations research to find solutions to their countries' skills-shortage problems. Some of the interventions tested include applying and evaluating the effectiveness of a novel skills-building approach for pharmaceutical supply management. Conclusion: Nurturing collaboration between regional institutions in resource-limited countries to build in-country skills in pharmaceutical supply management appears to be an effective intervention. Support from local programmes and technical assistance from organizations and institutions with the necessary expertise is critical for success, particularly at inception. The skills acquired by local institutions can be incorporated into both pre-service and in-service teaching curricula. This ensures long-term availability of skills in-country. The ability of trained institutions to mobilize their own resources for skills-building activities is crucial for the success and sustainability of these programmes.","[Matowe, Lloyd] Management Sci Hlth, Ctr Pharmaceut Management, RPM Plus Program, Arlington, VA 22203 USA; [Waako, Paul] Makerere Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Therapeut, Kampala, Uganda; [Adome, Richard Odoi] Makerere Univ, Dept Pharm, Kampala, Uganda; [Kibwage, Isaac] Univ Nairobi, Sch Pharm, Nairobi, Kenya; [Minzi, Omary] Muhimbili Univ, Coll Hlth & Allied Sci, Sch Pharm, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Bienvenu, Emile] Natl Univ Rwanda, Fac Med, Dept Pharm, Butare, Rwanda","Matowe, L (corresponding author), Management Sci Hlth, Ctr Pharmaceut Management, RPM Plus Program, 4301 N Fairfax Dr, Arlington, VA 22203 USA.",lmatowe@msh.org; pwaako@med.mak.ac.ug; rodoi@med.mak.ac.ug; okibwage@uonbi.ac.ke; ominzi@muchs.ac.tz; ebienvenu3@yahoo.com,,"Kibwage, Isaac/0000-0003-1257-8750",,,,14,13,13,0,18,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1478-4491,,,HUM RESOUR HEALTH,Hum.

At the beginning, farms were more diverse, dependent on animal traction, on-farm inputs and income and, after initial land grants, nearly independent of government policy. However. external issues. such as government policies, mechanization, fossil fuel costs, increased consolidation and vertical integration of markets and increased societal awareness of the environment and concern with farming practices, have Substantially altered the structure of agriculture. These external issues are significant drivers of agriculture and we grouped them into social/political, economic. environmental and technological drivers. Previous papers have examined specific effects of these drivers. Our objective is to examine how these drivers interact and influence today's agricultural systems. We developed four categories: (1) Commodity Crop Production. (2) Supply Chain Livestock Production, (3) Organic Production and (4) Extensive Livestock Production. to describe major current agricultural systems. These categories were developed as major and contrasting systems but do not represent all of American agriculture. Although it is not possible to predict the future, interactions among the various drivers will affect these systems differently. By examining multiple scenarios, We conclude the highly specialized systems (Nos. 1 and 2) are highly Vulnerable to future changes, and that developing adaptive capacity is critical for dealing with new uncertainty. Sustainable agricultural systems will need balance among various domains to be able to adapt and survive. We suggest that the concept of dynamic-integrated agricultural systems may he the best way to meet this goal because of its ability to consider multiple goals and flexible producer decision-making.","[Hendrickson, J.; Hanson, J.] USDA ARS, No Great Plains Res Lab, Mandan, ND 58554 USA; [Sassenrath, G.

Many look to deal quickly with disturbances. reduce inventory, and exchange information promptly throughout the supply chain. In other words they want to become more agile. To reach this objective it is critical for planning systems, to present planning strategies adapted to the different contexts, to attain better performances. Due to consolidation, the development of integrated supply chains and the use of inter-organizational information systems have increased business interdependencies and in turn the need for increased collaboration to deal with disturbance in a synchronized way. Thus, agility and synchronization in supply chains are critical to maintain overall performance. In order to develop tools to increase the agility of the supply chain and to promote the collaborative management of such disturbances. agent-based technology takes advantage of the ability of agents to make autonomous decisions in a distributed network through the use of advanced collaboration mechanisms. Moreover. because of the highly instable and dynamic environment of today's supply chains, planning agents must handle multiple problem solving approaches. This paper proposes a Multibehavior planning agent model using different planning strategies when decisions are supported by a distributed planning system. The implementation of this solution is realized through the FOR@C experimental agent-based platform. dedicated to supply chain planning for the lumber industry. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The motivators for such change include an increasingly tightening regulatory regime, increased consumer awareness, and inclination of investors to consider risks associated with lendings to hazardous material industries. As an effort to become greener, chemical industries are making conscious efforts to reduce their resource intensities or footprints. Such efforts need to be supported by models that can quantify the broad economic and environmental implications of industrial decisions. This manuscript uses the recently developed Ecologically Based Life Cycle Assessment (EcoLCA) model of the United States economy to analyze resource intensities of chemical industry sectors, comparing them with each other and with other industry sectors. The raw numbers are normalized by national flows to gain insight into possible resource vulnerabilities of industrial sectors. These numbers are also aggregated based on their mass or exergy to reduce their dimensionality and permit easier interpretation. Ecological cumulative exergy consumption (ECEC) allows consideration of a wide variety of ecosystem goods and services, human resources and emissions and their impacts on a consistent basis, and is shown to provide unique insight in addition to conventional measures based on mass and Industrial cumulative exergy consumption (ICEC). Ratios of ECEC to money indicate the relative throughputs of natural to economic capital, and are used for investigating supply chains of selected sectors and identifying likely keystone sectors. The insights obtained by juxtaposing resource intensities of chemical industry sectors amongst themselves and with those of the rest of economy are used to identify opportunities for reducing resources intensities of chemical industry sectors that could enable improvement of their environmental sustainability.

The literature on IT outsourcing and supply chain management has identified critical tradeoffs involved in increasing the number of suppliers and has strongly recommended focusing on a handful of strategic partners to balance these tradeoffs. Committing to a few strategic partners, however, may prevent a firm from discovering new suppliers, or even supply regions. Such missed opportunities may be particularly limiting in the context of offshoring professional services, which has exhibited rapid changes in supplier markets in the last decade. Thus, firms may want to engage in a more intensive multisourcing in services. If they do so, their success will depend on a global sourcing process that effectively addresses the critical tradeoffs involved. To explore how a global sourcing process can support multisourcing, we conducted a qualitative longitudinal case study of a large financial services institution that developed a varied global supply base to obtain offshore professional services. Our analysis results in a theory that emphasizes (i) advantages of a multiple provider strategy in rapidly changing global supply markets; (ii) the critical role of middle managers in enabling continuous innovation in the supplier structure; and (iii) the importance of the global sourcing process combining top-down and bottom-up decision making in multisourcing.","[Levina, Natalia; Su, Ning] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA","Levina, N (corresponding author), NYU, Stern Sch Business, 44 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA.",nlevina@stern.nyu.edu; nsu@stern.nyu.edu,,,,,,54,92,92,0,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0011-7315,1540-5915,,DECISION SCI,Decis.

We model the problem as a multistage stochastic program and propose a successive convex approximation method which solves the problem in stages and iteratively. An advantage of the method is that it can handle problems of large size where normally solving the problems by equivalent deterministic linear programs is considered to be computationally infeasible.

More specifically, this paper first proposes a conceptual framework for modeling distributed agent-based Advanced Planning and Scheduling (d-APS). Next, derived from this framework, it proposes some specific methods for understanding and modeling simulation problems at the initial phase of the modeling effort. This early phase is critical because it considerably influences the whole development process and the resulting simulation environment, but it is usually neglected in the concerned literature.

The proposed modelling and optimisation framework explicitly considers the presence of uncertainty in the behaviour of the chain, providing solutions that are robust with respect to possible perturbations. The performance is improved by optimising the values of the physical and the logistic parameters describing the supply chain. The objective of this second part is to illustrate and to test the proposed approach on a real-world case study, concerning a beef meat refrigeration and distribution chain. After a model development phase, optimisation is carried out with the aim to reduce costs while guaranteeing both correct meat refrigeration and delivery due dates. The numerical solutions provided by the proposed algorithm are discussed and their robustness with respect to uncertainty is evaluated. (C) 2007 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

These links are prone to disruptions, bankruptcies, breakdowns, macroeconomic and political changes, and disasters leading to higher risks and making risk management difficult. The purpose of this paper is to explore the phenomenon of risk management and risk management strategies in global supply chains. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is based on an extensive literature review and a qualitative study comprising 14 in-depth interviews and a focus group meeting with senior supply chain executives. Findings - The study provides insights into the applicability of six risk management strategies with respect to environmental conditions and the role of three moderators. Research limitations/implications - The model is developed in a global manufacturing supply chain context. It should be tested in other contexts and with other methods to provide generalizability. The study takes a much needed step toward building a theory of risk management in global supply chains, which opens important future research directions. Practical implications - This research provides direction to managers for choosing risk management strategies based on the global supply chain environment. Moderators have practical implications for global supply chain managers. Originality/value - The paper addresses an identified gap in the literature for selecting risk management strategies in global supply chains. It employs grounded theory, a methodology appropriate for theory-building, to explore a phenomenon with an inadequate theoretical base.","[Manuj, Ila] Univ N Texas, Dept Mkt & Logist, Denton, TX 76203 USA; [Mentzer, John T.] Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN USA","Manuj, I (corresponding author), Univ N Texas, Dept Mkt & Logist, Denton, TX 76203 USA.",ila.manuj@unt.edu,"Yang, Shicai/C-6094-2009",,,,,98,397,408,31,306,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0960-0035,1758-664X,,INT J PHYS DISTR LOG,Int.

They invest only on the core activities which gain higher profit and outsource non-critical production activities to their partner companies ( subcontractors or sourcing companies).

However, co-ordinating those loosely and distributed companies to meet the uncertain demands from the final customers is not simple. This research suggests an order confirmation mechanism that allows synchronizing the available capacities over the supply network. The mechanism is developed based on a factory agent system and a design of three protocols: ( 1) protocol for normal condition, ( 2) protocol for abnormal condition, and ( 3) protocol for cancellation. Based on the protocols, messages and procedures are designed.

In this paper, we have addressed the advanced integrated planning and scheduling problem in a rapidly changing environment, where the selection of outsourcing machine/operation, meeting the customers (single or multiple) due date, minimizing the makespan are the main objectives while satisfying several technological constraints. We developed a mixed integer programming model for integrated planning and scheduling across the outsourcing supply chain and showed how such models can be used to make strategic decisions. It is a computationally complex and mathematically intractable problem to solve. In this paper, a Chaos-based fast Tabu-simulated annealing (CFTSA) incorporating the features of SA, Tabu and Chaos theory is proposed and applied to solve a large number of problems with increased complexity. In CFTSA algorithm, five types of perturbation schemes are developed and Cauchy probability function is used to escape from local minima and achieve the optimal/near optimal solution in a lesser number of iterations.

However, most of existing design models for the supply chain assumes that it is known or pre-specified when products are manufactured and delivered, and therefore, only the amount of products and delivery are of interest to optimize within design frameworks. In order to provide high flexibility and cost-effectiveness in manufacturing and supply chain activities, both timing information (i.e., when to produce and deliver) and capacity (i.e., how much to produce and deliver) need to be considered simultaneously. New MILP (mixed integer linear programming) model for the design and optimization of the supply chain has been proposed, in which these two key decision variables are simultaneously optimized. For dealing with computational difficulties resulted from the large-size problem, a sequentially-updating procedure is also proposed. In this sequentially-updating procedure, the whole distribution network is divided into subsystems and optimized interactively within iterative procedure, where each subsystem is sequentially optimized until no profit improvement is observed. The enhanced flexibility of the supply chain can be obtained from this improved design philosophy. This also ensures reliable and robust responsiveness of the supply chain to customers' demand without sacrificing efficiency and/or cost-effectiveness of manufacturing and delivery activities. Illustrated case studies show that the proposed method is able to deal with large and complex supply chain problems with significant cost savings.","[Chen, C.; Kim, J. -K.] Univ Manchester, Sch Chem Engn & Analyt Sci, Ctr Proc Integrat, Manchester M60 1QD, Lancs, England","Kim, JK (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sch Chem Engn & Analyt Sci, Ctr Proc Integrat, POB 88, Manchester M60 1QD, Lancs, England.",J.Kim-2@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,16,6,6,0,4,INST CHEMICAL ENGINEERS,RUGBY,"165-189 RAILWAY TERRACE, DAVIS BLDG, RUGBY CV21 3HQ, ENGLAND",0263-8762,,,CHEM ENG RES DES,Chem.

To competitively exploit these products, one option is to incorporate used components in new or remanufactured products. However, this option is partly limited by a firm's ability to assess the reliability of used components. A comprehensive two-step approach is proposed. The first stage phase statistically analyzes the behavior of components for reuse. A well-known reliability assessment method, the Weibull analysis, is applied to the time-to-failure data to assess the mean life of components. In the second phase, the degradation and condition monitoring data are analyzed by developing an artificial neural network (ANN) model. The advantages of this approach over traditional approaches employing multiple regression analysis are highlighted with empirical data from a consumer product. Finally, the Weibull analysis and the ANN model are then integrated to assess the remaining useful life of components for reuse. This is a critical advance in sustainable management of supply chains since it allows for a better understanding of not only service requirements of product, but the remaining life in a product and hence its suitability for reuse or remanufacture. Future work should assess: (1) reduction in downtime of process equipment through the implementation of this technique as a means to better manage preventative maintenance; (2) reduce field failure of remanufactured product; (3) selling-service strategy through implementation of the proposed methodology.

We apply and compare the behavior and performance of the proposed machine learning algorithms to that obtained via DOE in a simulated Vendor Managed Replenishment system, developed for an actual firm. The results show that the models resulting from the proposed algorithms had strong explanatory and predictive power, comparable to that of DOE. The optimal system settings and profit were also similar to that obtained from DOE. The virtues of using machine learning and evolutionary algorithms to model and optimize data rich environments thus seem promising because they are automatic, involving little human intervention and expertise. We believe and are exploring how they can be made adaptive to improve parameter estimates with increasing data, as well as seamlessly detecting system (and therefore model) changes, thus being capable of recursively updating and reoptimizing a modified or new model.

In particular, we focus on the supply of rapidly perishable goods (ready-mixed concrete) that must be delivered to customers in strict time windows. The problem presents three main challenges. First, it includes several interrelated scheduling and routing problems, each affected by nearly prohibitive combinatorial complexity. Second, due to the perishable nature of the supplied products, effective solutions must not only optimize the objective function related to resource utilization and cost minimization, but also tolerate the small and frequent stochastic perturbations (transport delays) of the operating environment. Third, if major perturbations occur, the decision strategy must be able to respond in real time with effective rescheduling interventions restoring the indispensable synchronization of activities in progress, and avoiding extremely undesirable circumstances related to product decay. After providing a detailed mathematical model of the considered problem, this paper proposes a hybrid metaheuristic approach integrating a genetic algorithm with a number of problem-specific constructive heuristics. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated against other scheduling heuristics on an industrial case study. Note to Practitioners-This research work focuses on a challenging rescheduling problem related to the production and distribution of rapidly perishable goods. The approach presented in the paper aims at achieving a compromise between four fundamental issues (quality of solution, search time, robustness to perturbations, and transparency of the decision algorithm) that cannot be easily obtained with general-purpose solvers proposed to practitioners. The presented algorithm integrates three tools (a mathematical programming model, a genetic algorithm, and a set of constructive heuristics) in a global metaheuristic rescheduling algorithm. The approach does not provide guarantees about the closeness to optimality of the solutions, but gives interesting results on numerical experiments based on two large-scale industrial case studies. Although the presented rescheduling method is tailored for a specific just-in-time supply problem, it may be profitably extended to a number of similar production and distribution problems by redefining the model constraints and objectives, and adapting the reconstructive heuristics accordingly.","Dipartimento Elettrotecn & Elettron, Politecn Bari, I-70125 Bari, Italy","Naso, D (corresponding author), Dipartimento Elettrotecn & Elettron, Politecn Bari, I-70125 Bari, Italy.",naso@poliba.it; m.sufico@fidia.it; turchiano@poliba.it,,"Turchiano, Biagio/0000-0003-2662-7293",,,,33,18,20,0,20,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1545-5955,1558-3783,,IEEE T AUTOM SCI ENG,IEEE Trans.

Several economic indicators are used to evaluate timber scarcity. In particular, the market price of timber stumpage is believed to send a signal to investors in timber growing and to further regulate mill investments, thus preventing industrial overcapacities from emerging relative to future available wood supply. Our analysis of the Indonesian Pulp and Paper industry, one that expanded impressively in the 1990's and installed large overcapacities, gives us the elements to discuss the applicability of market price as a scarcity signal. Specific conditions, usually found in the developing world, most importantly weak or compromised public governance, flawed corporate governance, and the monopsony character of wood supply mechanisms, prevent the development of a market price scarcity signal. In this paper, special attention is paid to the complexity of the wood supply chain and the nature of the actors involved. This, together with the absence of pricing transparency, allows industrial overcapacities to occur, leading to the depletion of the natural forest. A key unresolved mystery here is why the private capital providers made no effort to detect this obvious and critical risk to the repayment capacity of their investments. The apparent absence of any government role in enforcing sustainable harvest or capacity levels results from state capture and governance failure, topics fully discussed elsewhere in the Indonesian case. The situation has implications for supply modeling as well as for public and private policies. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) can accelerate agricultural development by facilitating knowledge management. Based on an evaluation of several ICT initiatives in rural India, a framework to guide policy and implementation of ICTs in Indian agriculture is proposed. In this framework, agricultural development is visualized from two perspectives, a rural incomes and livelihoods perspective at the farm level, and a sustainability perspective at the regional level. The implementation of ICTs is proposed in three unique institutional environments: (i) closed vertical supply chain network for agribusiness enterprises, (ii) an open chain network with dynamically evolving partners and supply chain situations for the public, non-governmental and multilateral organizations, and (iii) a spatial data services network to address natural resources management and sustainability concerns. Each environment is assessed to identify its appropriate business models centered around ICTs, required technologies, scope for up-scaling the models, and required institutional and policy initiatives. In the future, as ICT infrastructure grows and connectivity and hardware costs decline, the critical constraints are likely to be the development of appropriate policy and institutional environments for the creation and delivery of information and knowledge to the end users. Significant policy, institutional networking and capacity building initiatives will be required at various levels to overcome the constraints and effectively integrate ICTs into the agricultural development process in India.

This change has caused ripples throughout the old supply network and raised questions about the future. The authors consider the impact of vertical disintegration in large-scale supply networks, particularly in the textile and electronics industries. They focus on supply chain strategies that have been adopted by network players in order to accommodate for the changing governance and ownership structures. Their broad hypothesis is that the process of disintegration in many industries is not sustainable from a coordination and control viewpoint, and therefore will be followed by eventual reintegration - although it may take different forms in different industries. They discuss the expanded role of the systems integrator, which, in many cases, goes beyond critical coordination services and extends into issues related to control and governance of portions of the supply network. They also explore the challenges that systems integrators are likely to face, and they contrast two different models of coordination and governance that could be adopted by such players.","MIT, Alfred P Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27706 USA","Bitran, GR (corresponding author), MIT, Alfred P Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",smrfeedback@mit.edu,,,,,,15,42,42,0,17,"SLOAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW ASSOC, MIT SLOAN SCHOOL MANAGEMENT",CAMBRIDGE,"77 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, E60-100, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139-4307 USA",1532-9194,,,MIT SLOAN MANAGE REV,MIT Sloan Manage.

Design/methodology/approach - A normative framework for selecting a planning approach was developed based on a literature review of supply chain differentiation and supply chain planning. Explorative mini-cases from three companies - Vaisala, Mattel, Inc. and Zara - were investigated to identify the features of their innovative planning solutions. The selection framework was applied to the case company's new business unit dealing with a product portfolio of highly innovative products as well as commodity items. Findings - The need for planning differentiation is essential for companies with large product portfolios operating in volatile markets. The complexity of market, channel and supply networks makes supply chain planning more intricate. The case company provides an example of using the framework for rough segmentation to differentiate planning. Research limitations/implications - The paper widens Fisher's supply chain selection framework to consider the aspects of planning. Practical implications - Despite substantial resources being used, planning results are often not reliable or consistent enough to ensure cost efficiency and adequate customer service. Therefore there is a need for management to critically consider current planning solutions.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper reports on action research carried out in the UK beef industry, with a focus on the food service supply chain. The methodology is inductive and qualitative, using a multi-case, multi-site approach. The supply chains presented in the case were analysed from farm gate to consumer, interviewing multiple participants at each stage of the supply chain. Findings - This study offers some partial support for configuration-based approaches. However, the case also raises some doubts about the validity of configuration thinking, as it is not the complexity or ambiguity of the relationships that is key in the case, but the fact that brand ownership and contracts create property rights for their owner that create a relatively permanent power resource for Pioneer, the case study company, in its market struggle with its customers and competitors. This interpretation supports the power and property rights views of strategic management rather than the configuration approach. Research limitations/implications - The research is based upon in-depth knowledge of the UK beef and red meat industry. It would be beneficial if further in-depth studies could be undertaken in other agri-food supply chains to further validate the findings. Practical implications - Although the focus of this article has been upon choosing appropriate sourcing strategies, the case study has also illustrated the importance for business managers of linking this sourcing strategy with a firm's marketing, and more specifically its branding strategy. Originality/value - The paper analyses the key differences in demand, supply and power and leverage characteristics in the food service beef supply chain to highlight the need for government agencies, think-tanks and industry participants to have a more robust understanding of industries before advocating the adoption of any one approach for all UK agri-food supply chains. This paper should be of value to researchers in this area and to managers responsible for strategy formation in UK agri-food supply chains.","Univ Birmingham, Sch Business, Ctr Business Strategy & Procurement, Birmingham, W Midlands, England","Chicksand, D (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Business, Ctr Business Strategy & Procurement, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",dchicksand@blueyonder.co.uk,,,,,,72,25,25,0,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1359-8546,1758-6852,,SUPPLY CHAIN MANAG,Supply Chain Manag.,,2007,12,5,,,,,321,333,,10.1108/13598540710776908,,,13,Business; Management,Business & Economics,209FR,WOS:000249374900002,,,,,2021-03-04

Viewed as a process of reterritorialisation or, more specifically, ecological localisation, such initiatives potentially provide constructive tools to re-address some of the environmental problems connected with agricultural restructuring and to re-organise production and consumption relations in the food system. This paper first examines the approaches and motives behind 24 food labelling schemes in selected European countries. It then uses this empirical material to conceptualise two development rationales: 'territorial' (place-based) and 'critical' (process-based). The rationales are explored through a comparative assessment of two Dutch case studies - Waterland and Milieukeur strawberries. The paper argues that producer involvement requires a clear economic incentive and that most food labelling schemes need significant institutional support if participation in more sustainable modes of production is to be fully realised.","Univ Gloucestershire, Countryside & Commun Res Unit, Cheltenham GL50 2RH, Glos, England","Ilbery, B (corresponding author), Univ Gloucestershire, Countryside & Commun Res Unit, Dunholme Villa,Pk, Cheltenham GL50 2RH, Glos, England.",bilbery@glos.ac.uk,,,,,,27,19,19,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Due to the fact that WSNs are composed of a large number of low-cost and energy-constrained sensor nodes, along with the notorious time-varying and error-prone nature of wireless links, scalable, robust and energy-efficient data dissemination techniques are needed for the emerging WSN applications such as environment monitoring and surveillance. In this paper, we examine this emerging field from the point of view of supply chain management and propose a hybrid data dissemination framework for WSNs. In particular, for each sensing task, the whole sensor field is conceptually partitioned into several functional regions based on the supply chain management methodology. Different routing schemes are applied to different regions in order to provide better performance in terms of reliability and energy consumption. For this purpose, we also propose a novel zone flooding scheme, essentially a combination of conventional geometric routing and flooding techniques. Our hybrid data dissemination framework features low overhead, high reliability, good scalability and flexibility, and preferable energy efficiency. Detailed simulation studies are carried out to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our scheme.","Univ Florida, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Wireless Networks Lab, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Worcester Polytech Inst, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Worcester, MA 01609 USA","Liu, W (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Wireless Networks Lab, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",liuw@ufl.edu; yczhang@ufl.edu; wjlou@ece.wpi.edu; fang@ufl.edu,"Fang, Yuguang/A-7484-2009","Fang, Yuguang/0000-0002-1079-3871",,,,30,8,8,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1022-0038,1572-8196,,WIREL NETW,Wirel.

Effective management of returned used product flows can have a great impact on the profitability and resulting financial viability of associated e-scrap reverse production systems. However, designing efficient e-scrap reverse production systems is complicated by the high degree of uncertainty surrounding several key factors. Very few examples of this complex design problem are documented in the academic literature. This paper contributes as analysis of a new, large-scale application that designs an infrastructure to process used televisions, monitors, and computer central pro- cessing units (CPUs) in the state of Georgia in the U.S. The case study employs a scenario-based robust optimization model for supporting strategic e-scrap reverse production infrastructure design decisions under uncertainty.

However, most contemporary accounting techniques, including engineering economics, life cycle assessment, and full cost accounting, fail in this regard, as they take natural capital for granted and concentrate mainly on the economic aspects and emissions. The recently developed thermodynamic input-output analysis (TIOA) includes the contribution of ecological goods, ecosystem services, human resources, and impact of emissions in an economic input-output model. This paper uses TIOA to determine the throughputs of natural and economic capitals along industrial supply networks. The ratios of natural to economic capitals of economic sectors reveals a hierarchical organization of the U.S. economy wherein basic infrastructure industries are at the bottom and specialized value-added industries constitute the top. These results provide novel insight into the reliance of specific industrial sectors and supply chains on natural capital and the corresponding economic throughput. Such insight is useful for understanding the implications of corporate restructuring on industrial sustainability metrics and of outsourcing of business activities on outsourcer, outsourcee, and global sustainability. These implications are discussed from the standpoints of weak and strong sustainability paradigms. The calculated ratios can also be used for hybrid thermodynamic life cycle assessment.","Ohio State Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Bakshi, BR (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",bakshi.2@osu.edu,"Bakshi, Bhavik R/G-3878-2012","Bakshi, Bhavik/0000-0002-6604-8408",,,,41,33,34,3,46,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,1520-5851,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

Many food companies are now aggressively focusing on logistics management as the last frontier to gain and sustain a competitive advantage. This study describes a model of intelligent food supply chain that improves efficiency within the supply chain. The aim of the paper is to demonstrate that agent technology can optimise food supply chains by (a) reviewing intelligent agents applications for supply chain optimisation and (b) illustrating how a multi-agent system can optimise performance of a beverage logistics network. Firstly, we review and synthesise existing applications in comparison to traditional and Internet-based technologies and critically evaluate agent technology applicability for supply chain management. We model the beer supply network to demonstrate that products can acquire intelligence to direct themselves throughout the distribution network. Optimisation agents can help solve specific problems of beverage supply: reduce inventories and lessen bullwhip effect, improve communication, and enable chain coordination without adverse risk sharing. Further, they gain a capability to be purchased and sold while in transit. Overviews of the supporting technologies that make such a supply chain a reality are fully discussed. In particular, optimisation agents have the characteristics of autonomous action, being proactive, reactive, and able to communicate. We demonstrate that agents enhance the flexibility, information visibility, and efficiency of the supply chain management. Suggestions and recommendations for further research are provided. Simulations of the agent-enabled supply optimisation can be used to benchmark for future research and development associated with building an optimisation agent. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

I present a particular critique of ethical trade based on its embeddedness in corporate strategies and management systems. The ethical trading strategies of leading UK food and clothing retailers form the empirical focus of inquiry, and theories found in the literature on economic geography concerning corporate strategy and interfirm organisation are used to gain critical insight into the management systems used by these retailers when they attempt to put ethical trading principles into practice in their global supply chains. Variations are observed between retailers in terms of their commitment to ethical trade, which are shaped by issues of corporate culture, financial management, and corporate restructuring. Varying levels of commitment to ethical trading strategy are argued in turn to influence organisational approaches to social auditing in the supply chain. Three contrasting modes of organisation for ethical monitoring are suggested to be used by retail companies-the arm's-length approach, the coordinated approach, and the developmental approach-each of which holds contrasting implications for suppliers and workers at production sites. I argue that corporate approaches to ethical trade vary markedly and that these variations have the capacity to shape the regulation of tabour conditions at sites of export production.","Univ Newcastle, Sch Geog, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England","Hughes, A (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Geog, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",Alex.Hughes@ncl.ac.uk,,,,,,98,51,51,0,36,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0308-518X,1472-3409,,ENVIRON PLANN A,Environ.

This supply chain environment requires a production-distribution planning system to enable the collaboration between production and distribution units more quickly and orderly. Generally, collaboration in a supply chain needs to resolve conflicts between two decentralised functional units, because each unit tries to locally minimise its own costs, not the overall supply chain costs. Also, there exists incomplete information sharing according to the information privacy of each functional unit. This paper proposes a decentralised production-distribution planning system using collaborative agents that can efficiently mediate the planning gaps between two decentralised planning functions: production and distribution. The validity of collaborative-agent model has been shown using some lemmas and numerical examples.","Yonsei Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Ind Engn, Seoul 120749, South Korea","Jung, HS (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Ind Engn, 134 Shinchon Dong, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",skek@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,11,28,29,1,10,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0268-3768,1433-3015,,INT J ADV MANUF TECH,Int.

The aim was to strengthen networking and improve the stakeholder response to accidental radioactive contamination of rural areas through participation in the FARMING network project. A hypothetical contamination of a large milk-producing area provided a suitable framework for evaluation of actions ensuring clean feeding of dairy cows during grazing. The following year the group received a compilation of rural countermeasures and waste disposal methods, described by the STRATEGY project. The robust, uncomplicated approach of the evaluation meetings was fruitful and efficient, and the multidisciplinary group was capable of taking shared views on various measures after updating their knowledge together. High priority was given to measurements of radioactivity and the provision of information and advice to a wider audience. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach - At first the main factors characterizing e-SN pattern are identified (organizational structures, managerial criteria and critical activities), then two separate procedures are adopted for developing an integrated reference framework. The first based on the analysis of correlations among variables influencing the factors under investigation; the second based on the analysis of different types of physical and immaterial flows among actors involved in the e-SN. On the basis of such evidence an integrated global framework is proposed, which is then used to classify and describe some relevant literature-based case studies. Findings - On the basis of two newly introduced variables, namely the internal integration degree and the decision-making concentration degree, the framework identifies four sets of organizational structures, managerial criteria and critical activities, each one coherent with specific environmental contexts. Research limitations/implications - The framework is restricted to describing and classifying different typologies of e-SN. Practical implications - The framework may be useful for assessing if the typology of organizational structure, managerial criteria and critical activities adopted for the management of a specific e-SN, is coherent with e-SN business environment. It may also provide useful guidelines for managers and practitioners involved in e-SN design. Originality/value - The paper provides an original integrated framework to classify e-SNs.","Univ Aquila, Fac Engn, I-67100 Laquila, Italy","Caputo, AC (corresponding author), Univ Aquila, Fac Engn, I-67100 Laquila, Italy.",,"Cucchiella, Federica/F-3925-2011; Fratocchi, Luciano/F-7324-2014","Cucchiella, Federica/0000-0001-7057-4411; Fratocchi, Luciano/0000-0001-9562-0744; PELAGAGGE, Pacifico/0000-0002-3045-1289",,,,36,8,8,0,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1359-8546,1758-6852,,SUPPLY CHAIN MANAG,Supply Chain Manag.,,2005,10,2,,,,,84,95,,10.1108/13598540510589160,,,12,Business; Management,Business & Economics,923QC,WOS:000228923400003,,,,,2021-03-04

Findings - The study develops a framework for measuring the relative importance of a particular dimension based on the application of theoretical concepts from the information systems and management science literature to the digital, knowledge economy. Since contextual factors play a critical role in the design of effective knowledge-management (KM) systems, technical and process solutions need to be customized to fit the organization performance criteria, dimensions of agility and supply chain drivers. Research limitations/implications - The model presented is dependent on the perceptual weightings provided by the decision-maker and the generalizability of findings based on our model to other organizations may be limited.

A multi-stage system comprising gravel pre-filters, slow sand filters and terminal disinfection conforms with the multiple barrier concept in relation to pathogen removal. Employing upflow gravel pre-filters as a form of pretreatment also considerably reduces the risk of the slow sand filter blocking as a result of the surface straining of particles present in the raw water. The performance of a multi-stage treatment system, comprising shallow upflow gravel pre-filters and fabric-enhanced slow sand filters, was investigated both in service and during cleaning operations in a UK-based research project. The pre-filters provided microbial and physical treatment capacity and attenuated peaks in the raw water to the benefit of the slow sand filter. The slow sand filter achieved high levels of pathogen removal in addition to providing further physical treatment. The novel raised floor configuration adopted for the upflow pre-fliters enabled high cleaning efficiencies to be achieved by rapid draindown. In parallel with the research work, a multistage system was constructed at Nyabwishongwezi, Rwanda, to provide a supply for new communities settling in the northern section of the Akagera Game Park following the 1994 genocide and war. The Nyabwishongwezi Treatment Plant and Supply Network Project was promoted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Oxfam and Minitrape, Rwanda. It was constructed broadly in keeping with the advice given to the parties promoting the project by the Centre for Environmental Health Engineering (CEHE), University of Surrey, during research visits to Rwanda in the late 1990s. In October 2003, CEHE research staff visited Nyabwishongwezi to support the Rwandan organisation (the Regie) operating the multi-stage plant and distribution system. The multi-stage system was found to be achieving substantial levels of microbial and physical improvement of the raw water obtained from the River Umuvumba.","Univ Surrey, Environm Hlth Engn Ctr, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England","Clarke, BA (corresponding author), Univ Surrey, Environm Hlth Engn Ctr, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England.",,,"Dorea, Caetano/0000-0001-9367-0668",,,,15,3,3,0,17,THOMAS TELFORD PUBLISHING,LONDON,"THOMAS TELFORD HOUSE, 1 HERON QUAY, LONDON E14 4JD, ENGLAND",1741-7589,,,P I CIVIL ENG-WAT M,Proc.

Such networks are found in a variety of applications such as in supply chain networks, computer and communication networks, metabolic networks, food webs, etc. Here, we present a theory of self-organization by evolutionary adaptation in which we show how the structure and organization of a network is related to the survival, or in general the performance, objectives of the system. We propose that a complex system optimizes its network structure in order to maximize its overall survival fitness which is composed of short- and long-term survival components. These in turn depend on three critical measures of the network, namely, efficiency, robustness and cost, and the environmental selection pressure. Fitness maximization by adaptation leads to the spontaneous emergence of optimal network structures, both power law and non-power law, of various topologies depending on the selection pressure. Using a graph theoretical case study, we show that when efficiency is paramount the star topology emerges and when robustness is important the circle topology is found. When efficiency and robustness requirements are both important to varying degrees, other classes of networks such as the hub emerge. This theory provides a general conceptual framework for integrating survival or performance objectives, environmental or selection pressure, evolutionary adaptation, optimization of performance measures and topological features in a single coherent formalism. Our assumptions and results are consistent with observations across a wide variety of applications. This framework lays the ground work for a novel approach to model, design and analyze complex networks, both natural and artificial, such as metabolic pathways, supply chains and communication networks.

It is assumed that e-SC performances are influenced by the network organizational structures, by the criteria adopted to manage relationships among involved actors, and by the critical activities that the leading company performs. At first, the variables influencing such factors are identified and the interdependencies among them are analysed to establish existing correlations. This, in turn, enables one to group the values of the influencing factors in four coherent sets which are consistent with different business environments, thus assuring the effectiveness and efficiency to the e-SC. The obtained reference model is then tested by applying it to literature-based case studies. The output of this model may be used to design totally new e-SCs or to redesign the existing ones, in both manufacturing and services industries.","Univ Aquila, Fac Engn, Laquila, Italy","Caputo, AC (corresponding author), Univ Aquila, Fac Engn, Laquila, Italy.",,"Fratocchi, Luciano/F-7324-2014; Cucchiella, Federica/F-3925-2011","Fratocchi, Luciano/0000-0001-9562-0744; Cucchiella, Federica/0000-0001-7057-4411; PELAGAGGE, Pacifico/0000-0002-3045-1289",,,,33,30,31,1,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0263-5577,1758-5783,,IND MANAGE DATA SYST,Ind.

In this paper, we focus on the scheduling of periodic data transcription in append-only environments, such as e-mail inboxes, newsgroups, technical support bulletin boards, or procurement requests. If the client connects to the server too frequently, the client will nearly always have up-to-date information, but the usage of network resources may be excessive. Conversely, very infrequent connections will conserve network resources, but the client's data may often be significantly out of date, which may also be costly (in terms of lost opportunities, for example). Thus, the best transcription policies should make on optimal trade-off between these costs. Our approach to evaluating this trade-off is to use modeling techniques from the field of stochastic processes. The paper presents a general model for data insertions on the server side, using compound nonhomogeneous Poisson processes, and compares several transcription policies in terms of both transcription cost and obsolescence cost. The comparisons use a validation data set from a real data feed, and our models were calibrated using a separate training set from the same feed. We find that transcription policies based on a nonhomogeneous Poisson arrival model often outperform simpler policies.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Stoumbos, ZG (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, 94 Rockafeller Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",stoumbos@andromeda.rutgers.edu,,,,,,48,2,2,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0736-2994,,,STOCH ANAL APPL,Stoch.

The region is also affected locally by high levels of salinity in soils and water. Attempts to manage this situation to permit economic development through agriculture and industry over several centuries seemed to have ameliorated the worst excesses and during the 20th century a series of major dam projects offered the potential for sustainable future economic growth. However, rapid population growth and shifting patterns of agriculture have brought the question of sustainability back on to the agenda. This paper analyses the hydrological characteristics of the severe drought of the mid-1990s, in terms of its impacts both on water quantity and water quality in the region. The strategies adopted to maintain domestic and tourist water supplies in the face of high demands from irrigation, particularly looking at the conjunctive use of groundwater, and the development of regional water grids are evaluated. The pressures on water quality, which developed in various parts of the Guadalhorce hydrological system, including in the main water supply network for the city, are also explored. The paper concludes that the demands on the water supply system are unlikely to be manageable through current strategies and that ecological and water quality issues will probably prove more critical than water volumes in determining approaches to management of future droughts.

Collaboration among the members of SCM plays a critical role to implement an effective SCM, but its implementation would not be easy only with the conventional information sharing mechanism. This study employs the idea of open tender concept with blackboard-based negotiation to develop a collaborative supply chain system. The open tender concept is designed to provide an open and free opportunity to all participants, which make a sound competition to obtain the tender. Blackboard-based negotiation is derived from the mechanism of negotiation among intelligent agents using a blackboard as a media where each agent exchange information. The study applies the idea to a parts/material supply system, which is designed to function as a part of SCM. For replenishment of parts/materials, a company issues a tender and publishes it to a public blackboard for information exchange via the Internet using electronic tender submission form to find appropriate suppliers. Candidate suppliers to the tender are invited to issue their quotations, which compete one another under an open environment and the most appropriate candidate is selected as a result of open competition.

We believe real-time and asynchronous collaboration technology will play a critical role in allowing manufacturers to increase their supply chain agility. We are realizing our efforts through our Virtual Situation Room (VSR) technology. The primary goal of the VSR technology is to enhance current ad-hoc, limited methods and mechanisms for spontaneous, real-time communication using feature-rich, industry standards-based building blocks and network protocols. VSR technology is bring designed to find and engage quickly all relevant members of a problem solving team supported by highly interactive, conversational access to information and control and enabled by business processes, security policies and technologies, intelligence, and integration tools.
